21663,Dating,1r0ytm,"Hey, I'll try to make this really quick. I had a very good friend in high school (and middle school), but developed a crush on her when we were in tenth grade. She didn't feel the same and we drifted apart. She knows I still have very strong feelings for her, but I know she doesn't, so I leave her alone. After a while we start talking ocassionaly, but just as friends. We also see each other on most weekends (parties).

So there was a party last weekend to celebrate the birthday of this rich kid, who is also much better looking than me (not sure if that's important but whatever). I resent him (he has everything I wish I had). He's a good friend of hers, and I think she likes him. I was invited through another common friend.

Anyyyway, I meet her there, and we both hang out with the same people, but don't talk to each other other than to say hi, but we start dancing and she suddenly whispers into my ear I love you. I say I love you too. We finish the song, she leaves me standing there, and goes to talk with her friends. About an hour later, she's drunk and trying to make out with the rich kid, but her friends stop her for whatever reason.

I really care for this girl. What should I do? If anything was unclear, let me know. English is not my native language, so sorry for any mistakes :P

21672,Dating,20rhoj,"Person I've known for a few years now, didn't really become decent friends until this year. Earlier in the year, was considering asking her out, but she started dating (unofficially) another guy. No big deal, kind of sad about it for a week or two. Got over it.

She broke up with him like a month ago (ish), recently realized I want to ask her out again. Been trying to think it out before I ask her out, because I don't want to lose a good friend if I ask her out, she says no and it turns awkward and we just stop talking (this is always a big fear of mine).

Today, in class we were doing notes from the board, teacher doesn't really care if we talk or anything so we're in a pair, copying notes and everything. Was about to ask her out, and she mentioned something about prom so I waited and listened. Apparently, she went to breakfast one morning with her friend and her friend's freshman (male) friend. They were talking about prom during breakfast and the boy said 'I wish I could go to prom' and she replied, 'I don't have a date, you can go with me so you can say you went.' (Not exact words)

I stopped there. Up until this point, I had been thinking (or I guess, fooling myself) that she would be interested in a relationship. Now I don't know. If she'd just as easily go with some random freshman and not have a problem mentioning it to me, I doubt she cares about any relationship that is more than being friends.

I feel torn because I have no idea what to do. Move on? I could but I don't want to if I don't have to. Ask her out? Even if I could, I doubt she'd say yes.

I would just like some advice on the matter. I'm really bad at dating in general and always get pretty down when something like this happens.

**Quick background**: girl, M, and I met about 6 months ago at (where else?) a party, hit it off,  and have been enamored by each other ever since.  She recently ended a 3 month relationship that was doomed from the start and after taking some months to recover, we've gone on two casual dates (outside our social get-togethers) in the midst of our busy schedules. 

**Situation**: Now given our work and school lives, the scenario will, for better or worse, result in me driving to her place in the late evening, chatting mindlessly and drinking for a bit, perhaps putting a movie on, and then going to business once we can't wait any longer.  Nothing too hot-and-heavy, at the very most, second-base material.

But I want to try something special.  What would people recommend?  

Because our sexual tension is **palpable**, I was wondering if the moment we meet inside her place, I immediately go in for the kiss - a passionate, but brief one.  A sort of 'preview' kiss that personifies the struggle to contain that tension (*ugh* that reads like bad fan fiction).

We started hanging out by doing the class assignments together. Last Friday we hung out in a party-type setting. Nothing happened, but it was fun.

Then Saturday night I was up late texting him, telling him I was bored and not tired. He ends up coming over, we smoke, chill for hours, and then end up making out. I told him I didn't want to do anything else, but then changed my mind as things got hot and heavy. We ended up having sex. It was awesome. By the time we finished bumping uglies, it was like 6 or 7 am and we cuddled and slept late into the morning.

We texted a little bit after this happened, but I'm starting to get the feeling that all he wanted was some booty. I felt like I was starting most of the text convos after the hook up... I'm newly single, so I'm probably just not used to this kind of stuff. It seems like we have similar interests and I could totally see myself dating him.

21687,Infidelity,1ji1d6,"Let me start off by saying I still love my girlfriend very much. We connected extremely well.

In the beginning of July I found out she had been texting another guy and cheating on me. No sex, but taking and sending pictures of herself to him. Her reason was her low self esteem of herself as she used to be fat. I forgave her and we continued our relationship on the grounds she never does it again. 

I get suspicious sometimes as one would after such an event and want to look at her phone. She will not let me look at her messages to her best friend, a guy in the army, as she talks about me. About a week ago she got extremely angry at me for thinking something was going on between them. 

Also a month ago I found out she had stopped taking her birth control, forgot, and decided to take it again once she got her period. She ended up being late and not getting it. The day she should have started was the day she started acting extremely different towards me. 

I looked it up and told her to start taking her pill again as her hormones are all out of wack. She finally listened and has been back on it for a few days now.

Oh and we have not had sex in 13 days now which is so not like us. She says she just has no sexual urge right now and doesn't want to be touched or anything. She keeps bringing up space and how she wanted more.

I did get laid off 3 weeks ago and am starting a new job on this next Monday. She brought up last night that if our space from me working doesn't help us then she doesn't know what we are going to do. She said she doesn't like spending 100% of her time with me which she has been doing.

She has also been real mean to me lately while I still constantly tend to her and do things for her.

So what are your guys opinions here? What is the real cause of our falling out. I need to know what to do as I still love her but am also thinking about breaking it off.

One last thing too is we kind of live together but not officially because I still pay for another apartment across the street.

21693,Breakups,39sdu8,"So here it goes,

Hey guys/gals of reddit, today will be a long read for you so sit back and enjoy this ride.
I'm going to talk about how I'm recently out and single and some questions I have about dating/making friends.

Me and my Ex-Girlfriend have a very good relationship with each other. We stopped dating about two months ago and she has gone back into a previous relationship with an ex.

A little background,
She was still getting over being in love with said ex when we started dating, she decided to start dating me around the beginning of Novemeber last year and had decided she was done with him. 
Now at this same time, from what I understand is that they had been broken up for about a little more than half a year.

He had actually figured out he was IN LOVE with her still and was confused and scared before when they were dating. 
When me and her started dating, I learned later in our relationship that he kept his mouth shut out of respect for our happiness if it didn't include him in the picture. I still think he has done nothing wrong and neither has my ex. 

So fast forward 4 months in and I'm freaking out and being scared becuase I don't even know my own feelings and have to tell said ex that I'm not sure if I'm feeling the effects of being in love. After that is when our relationship started to get really heavy over the next four months. She had a hard time with the fact that I was unsure about my feelings when she knew how she had felt the whole time. It started eating away at us and was leading to our breakup. In the meantime, she was getting more frustrated with me about me not knowing how I feel. Genuinely I couldn't tell if I was in deep love with her or I just loved her alot but not in that deep way I thought I should feel. In fact I still can't tell to be completely honest with everyone here. 

I had a hard time with work and family interrupting our days we had set off for each other. I had been in a car accident when we first dated which hurt my memory badly and another one months later that involved me hitting someone and had two family deaths that really fucked me up for a bit here. 

This is when things got worse. She told me about how her ex told her that he was in love with her and she didn't know how to feel about it since she couldn't trust him since the breakup. She then told me she doesn't know what to do because she does still love him, but she loves me too and that she feels like no matter what she does she hurts herself and someone else. I told her she needed to sort our her feelings and that a break she suggested might be a good idea. 

So we both go on break a couple months after all of this happens. Small amount of contact since I was in another state for a funeral and she was in another state as well, visiting the state the ex is in. I told her I'm an understanding person and that if on break, she needed to do what she had to to figure out how she feels. She told me the same, I didn't sleep with anyone on our break, she did sleep with the ex, but after we got back she told me about everything and that even after doing that she was even more confused about how she felt. 

We then after a couple days, had long talks about how we felt about were we are both going in our lives, how much we love each other, and basically what to do next.

The decision was to end our relationship so we wouldn't end up hating each other when we knew that continuing would just hurt us more.

About 3-4 weeks after the breakup her ex, he asked her if they could have a LDR since he does love her that much. She talked with me about it and made sure that it wouldn't mess us up as we have stayed friends after the breakup and have talked frequently since then. 

It has been hard, but I deem it to be worth it. I told her to give him a chance since I know how much he loves her and that even though I love her very much, I know I cannot make her happy. He can though, so I said it was okay about 1.1/2 months into him asking her.

Me and her still talk on the regular, we are still best friends with a strong bond that ties me to her. I just wish I would've had enough time to figure myself out, but she is a fast paced person and I'm just not like that.

So my questions are;
1. What should I do to heal from all of these events properly?
2. I have found out I've always liked a local girl, but have never talked to her, need to know the eddiquette for timing for myself and my ex.
3. How to make friends around my area since alot of my good friends for years have turned into utter shits.

Thanks for reading everyone!
Have a good day,

21695,Dating,3c9qtx,"Alrighty, so lately I have been dealing with very intense feelings of both romantic and sexual attraction for one of my friends. I’m not entirely sure what the best course of action would be so I’ve come here asking for help. 

First, some background info. I’ve known him for over a ½ year now and have gotten to be good friends with him during that time. My attraction to John (name changed for privacy) started in late May and came on rather suddenly. Since it seemed to come from nowhere, I was hoping it would pass/I could dismiss the feelings but it seems my attraction has only grown the more I see him. The last time I was in a relationship was several years ago, and since then I have not engaged in intimate behaviors of the sensual/sexual/romantic type with anyone. I have found plenty people attractive and whatnot since ending my previous relationship but have never desired to pursue anything with any of them, until John. 

I’ve never been particularly good at flirting (unless already in an established relationship, which does not help at all in this situation haha) but I have been trying to show I am interested in him. No clue if this helps me show him I’m interested or not, but I do things like make eye contact, smile, glance at him, ask about his hobbies, engage in playful banter involving innuendos, and physical contact. 

He’s never seemed put off by any of the behaviors I’ve listed above, but I cannot for the life of me tell if it’s because he doesn’t really notice, the interest is mutual, or if he just doesn’t care. Anytime I touch him he doesn’t shrug it off or seem weirded out. We hung out over the weekend with our friends and I leaned up against him on the couch while we watched a movie/he played his game. He never scooted away from me or seemed to mind. At one point I asked him to pass me my drink and he held it out of reach so I had to lean across him to grab it. One night when we were hanging with friends we were the last two awake so we went in a different room and stayed up til nearly 8am just laughing and being silly and occasionally brushing hands ‘n the like. These instances and other small ones give me the sense that he might also be interested in me. I honestly canNOT TELL THOUGH BECAUSE WHAT IS FLIRTING. 

I think I want to tell him how I feel but here’s where the biggest issue comes in: he’s moving away in 3 weeks. He’ll be coming back in December since he’s just going away for a semester. We go to the same college, but he lives on campus and I live ~30 minutes away from it. The only time I get to see him in-person is on Fridays/Saturdays when we hang out with our friends. So I’ve got 3 more weeks with him until he’s gone for awhile. I really do want to tell him but I don’t want things to be awkward for the last few weeks if the interest is not mutual. I’ve no idea what the best thing to do is and it’s something I keep thinking about whenever I’m not focused on anything. I’d really appreciate some advice


**tl;dr** I like my friend a lot and I feel like it might be mutual. I really want to tell him my feelings but he moves out-of-state at the end of the month (until December) so is there any point?

21712,Breakups,2ey4rq,"Allow me to start off by saying that I am an athiest and she is a christian. I have no problem with the religious situation. I asked her before we started dating if that was going to be a problem and she said no.

We were perfect together. We were deeply in love, communicated like no other way I have seen before, were deeply understanding of the other, and never fought. During the time of knowing her, she has become my best friend and the one I can talk through my problems with to become a better person.

This relationship had defined me in many ways. I am not the same person I was before I met her, and I mean that in a good way. She helped me understand the world in a way that no one else could. She showed me how to love. She was my everything, and we were always on the same page.

She moved into her dorm 2 weeks ago and hour away, and since then she has been thinking about the future between the two of us. Well, two days ago she broke up with me because she envisions a family that goes to church together and has a spiritual connection together. I can't be that for her. I understand where she is coming from, but this is hard to swallow. The breakup was understanding on both ends. We cried together, said whatever we needed to say on our minds, and said our goodbyes.

Last night I called her because it was unbearable. We talked together and she cleared up many things up for me that I was dwelling on. She also helped talk me through cleaning her things out my room to move on. WE WERE HELPING EACH OTHER THROUGH THE BREAKUP. This doesn't happen...

We are perfect together, and if it weren't for religion we would stay together forever. I wholeheartedly believe that statement, and she does too.

Reddit, my questions are these: Is there any way around this breakup (Could we somehow talk through this)? If not, should we be friends (This woman is my real life partner.. But I know it will be so hard on the both of us trying to be friends)? Or, how do I move on from this (I'm losing my best friend and I cannot take this any longer)?

21720,Breakups,2vgt38,"Long story short, I flirted with this girl on and off for about six months. We started to get to know each other when she was dating a friend through our shared community. We found out that we have a lot of interest in common. They broke up, essentially because he pressured her for sex and she is a virgin. This becomes important later in the story. 

Then I come into the picture as a serious suitor. Flirt a lot through text, and even go on a lunch date. She DTR'd me at the time so I backed off until the end of Summer/Start of Fall. 

We talk casually until I ask her out on a serious date. This surprised her slightly, but she agreed and we had, what I thought and she mentioned, a great time. I fumbled the goodbye kiss, practically putting more pressure on the both of us. She later told me she was a little disappointed at this kiss and I couldn't blame her, I was too. (Essentially I wanted to kiss her during our first date in the late spring, but I couldn't. The opportunity wasn't there I and I really didn't have a chance. This anticipation built within me on our date. )

Overall I thought she really enjoyed herself, and more importantly I really enjoyed myself. Enjoying myself on a date can be really difficult for me as I personally get anxious and worry more about whether they are having a great time. 

After a second date she takes me back to her apartment and while making out, she brings up the fact that she is seeing someone else. 

(I of course now realize that this is where I should've said I wanted to be the one and only, but I often fear that sorta commitment. At this point I actually told a couple girls I was talking to that I was seeing someone and that I had to devote my energy to her. I even de-activated my OKcupid and Tinder.)

I told her it was okay for now, and that it's part of being an adult and I couldn't expect her to make a choice like that when we had only been on two dates. I actually believed this at the time and I still think it's true. I didn't know about this other guy, and I almost wish she never said anything. 

Well Fast forward about five more fluff dates (Netflix, etc), and about a month. We are making out and she tells me she is still seeing the other dude! She feels uncomfortable, and basically that I was putting a similar pressure on her to her ex. She shuts down. 

(I'd like to note that I was very aware of the situation, and tried to be as considerate as possible. Almost to the point where I felt like I couldn't show affection. Physical connection is very important to me, so I was willing to do what I could but it of course drove me crazy. I'm the smother you with Hugs and Kisses type.) 

After we have a little fight, I feel really hurt and kinda shut her out a little. It was one of those moments where you feel all the feels and you just can't really say what you are thinking. 

Part of me thinks that this was all a case of bad timing. She's normally the type that'll throw themselves at you, but with me she held back. She even told me this during our fight. This was incredibly frustrating as I expected her to be all over me. 

She decides that she should leave, and I agree with her. This is the end of our relationship. 

The next day, realizing what had happened I asked her to meet and I just broke up with her. Justifying it to myself and friends as she was playing me. 

Months later I kinda look back at the situation and like anything I realize where I could've made better decisions. We haven spoken since.

Like stated in the title I started dating M27 back in November of 2013. Things heated up quickly. I was in my third year of university and he was on the same campus. Had a lot in common the sex was amazing. Pretty much inseparable. It heated up quick and we moved too fast. I was engulfed by lust and I thought he was perfect. Then of course came the fighting. Lots of bikering And heated arguments about things that really should t of mattered. I know I'm not perfect and I was finishing a very stressful university program and I was on edge. I'm not much of a drinker but we smoked lots of pot together on the daily. I didn't see it until later but he had major issues with drinking. It wasn't till later in the  relationship that I started becoming really uncomfortable with his drinking. Very volitiale and often the arguments would begin after he came home from drinks. He was either high on pot or drunk 24/7. Sadly the guy hated his base line. In November of 2013 he showed up at my apartment at 7am after totalling his car tearful stating that he couldn't be at his parents anymore. I took him in no questions asked because I loved him and really wanted to move in with him. I suspected drinking and driving but wow Im an idiot and just wanted to take care of him.  Around feb/ March 2014 things between us we're going down hill fast. I had finished university and landed a job in my field. Great work but stressful with long 12hr shifts. I was working shift and I would often come home to a messy home and him passed out. We were both volatile to each other. This is when I began to wonder what he was doing with his time. Often stayed up late gaming and drinking with out consideration to my shift work. Often he would go out and not come home. He hadent had a job in the time we were together yet he could afford alcohol and weed and apparently tuition.  He reported having a massive savings account. I'm an idiot. Fast forward to April we get Into a spat. He had some of his boys over and of course was drinking. We got into a spat because I wasn't keen on him going out and buying more booze. He yelled at me and just broke it off. He left that night and I had no clue where he was. I slept on the couch waiting for him. I just wanted him to stay. He wouldn't give me the time of day. I didn't know what else to do so I called his sister who told me to basically run. He had lied to me about everything. She told me that this was a pattern of his to use his girlfriends and that he often played victim. She told me to never talk to him again and to get on with my life. He had no savings and his parents were supporting him and that she tim felt that he was an alcoholic( runs in the family). After taking with Her I later found out that he was out drinking after he left me. I was crushed. He chose alcohol over me again. I have tears in my eyes just typing this out. He came a day later and got his things. My heart still hurts because I didn't hear a word from his friends or family after that day. I feel completely abandoned. I understand to an extent, but still. I was tossed away like garbage. After that he still kept wanting to come around the apartment to hang out ( he moved into his parents basement and wasnt liking it) I told him off and went no contact for a while. Then around the holidays I started feeling depressed. I don't have much close family around these parts. I called him up and we had sex cause I'm a sad sack. He told me about dates his friends were setting him up in ect. Hurt my heart.  He left the next morning and I felt dead inside. I was like a pathetic dog who had been beaten by its owners and was crawling back and begging for some sort of affection . He once agin rejected me completely. 
I'm dissapointed in myself and frusursted because I see everything that's going on. I'm completely aware of his manipulative and terrible he is for me yet I still hurt this much. Yet I still want him to love me. Which he never will. He will never love me and treat me like I should be treated 
These days i feel like damaged goods. Some failed dating during those months. Can't say im ready to date again and I'm not sure when I will be :/ I still really blame myself for ruining the relationship. He was my first live in boyfriend. I gave up a lot for him. I'm not sure what kind of advice others can offer but it felt good to put this out there! Thanks for reading reddit.

21722,Dating,21k5bh,"A couple weeks ago I asked out a girl I work with. She seemed extremely nervous about our first date but once things got going she really opened up and we had a great time.


I took her to a beautiful park near my neighborhood. We walked, talked, held hands, flirted, goofed around... overall great date.


She said she had a great time with me and looked forward to our next date. Unfortunately, I fucked up the goodnight kiss (she turned last second and I smashed my face into her cheek) but that's fine.


Anyways, the next day we were texting and somehow go onto the topic of serious relationships. She said that her last relationship was really intense and lasted almost 2 years, and that it will take her awhile before she feels that deeply about someone else again. She also said she wants to take it slow with me on the emotional/serious level and just have fun. 


I understand all of that but I'm the type of person who likes to know where things stand. I told her I agreed and that we should take time to build our relationship before getting serious but really I just want someone to love.

21723,Breakups,1p8b6v,"Background:
I'm 24, a piano performance major. Bisexual, atheist, never want children, don't want to get married, love sex.

She's 20, a music education major. Straight, Christian, wants children, wants to get married, is not having sex until marriage, has a negligible sex drive.

So, when we started dating, we had that chat where you find out what the other person wants out of life. What she wanted wasn't anything like what I wanted. We both saw the writing on the wall, and knew it wasn't going to last.

Fast forward 4 months, to about 2 months ago. I was feeling the need to move on, given that the relationship was getting stale. She apparently wasn't. When I tried to open up the subject to I think we're not the right people for each other and we need to move on while we're still friends, she freaked out.

As soon as she understood what I was talking about, she lost it. I'm talking like full-on hysterics, curled up into a ball sobbing, rocking back and forth on the floor, hands shaking violently, the works. I was terrified. I immediately backtracked, saying something like unless you need some more time to get used to the idea, in which case we can keep dating for a few more weeks.

Fast forward about an hour (yes, an hour) and she's calmed down enough to where I can understand her speak, and we continue from there.

Here's my question: Given the previous reaction to the breakup talk, how might I avoid breaking her heart like that again? Because my feelings haven't changed, and I know this isn't going to last. I've given her plenty of time, and I'm just not interested any more. How can I explain this to her?

But we got back together and things have been amazing. No complaints whatsoever. We seemed stronger than ever. I knew he was somewhat seeing someone while we were broken up. fair enough. Fast forward to now. I saw texts from the girl in his phone. I did the worst and snooped. 


She texted him that she missed him and he said he wanted to get together to catch up/apologize. But even worse, the texts continue from there. Nothing AWFUL, but things like me and cold weather will be here when you get back (she's on vacation?) and some winky faces. This obviously leads me to believe he plans to see her again (well, he said he wanted to in the texts). 


What do I do??? I'm not prepared to lose him. We had plans to move in once our leases were up. I thought we were going to get married. He and I equally discussed these things. AND -- how do I bring this all up without exposing that I was snooping?

It was my fault, she gave me so many signs, and so many chances. She was always giving me her 100% but I could never give that back because of school / life/ etc... and now I regret that. I am going to miss her, but I know that I cant just sit around and mope forever.

During the pass 10 years i havent really talk to her but over this recent summer i started talking to her a lot more, and chilling with her more when we go out with our mutual friends. Eventually i caught interest in her and i asked her to chill. Eventually after asking her 2 times we chilled but it wasnt until the end of october because of school.

i started falling for her and told her how she felt but i didnt ask her how she felt until the next day. After i asked she said she felt the same way, so im like in my head sweet i really enjoy chilling with her and we will prob chill a lot in the future. 

 its Christmas break and now she has no school but she has work, so i assumed we could go on a date once or twice over the break. Ive been telling her i really wanted to go on a date since after i told her how i felt and asked her if she wanted to during the break. She said ya if she has time, so over the break we hung out twice with a group of friends and both times i really enjoyed her company. So now its the end week 2 of her break and i at least asked her out 3 times on a date and she replies busy or come chill with our mutual friends.

   Now week 3 and i asked her out again and she said shes busy for the next 2 weeks, and she explain what she was going to doing. Right now im really sadden because of the unforuntate turn of events, and i express to her how i felt sad but didnt really didnt go into detail because i didnt want to said a paragraph text right away. I didnt get any response. I know usually girls take a little more time to get comfortable in expressing how they feel, but not even a response is kinda disheartening. So i just assume she doesnt know what to say to make myself feel better.

   Right now its new years eve and im pretty sad looking forward we probably wont chill till summer and i feel like she really isnt putting time for me or she doesnt want to go on date. If anyone could help or just give their take on the situation it would be helpful.

Now it came to her attention through a mutual friend of ours that the feelings might be mutual between us. This led to her calling me up and we had a long discussion where we talked about where she was with her boyfriend and what her hang ups were about entering a new relationship. This is great, it cleared the air we both admitted that we liked each other. Now at the moment she's almost graduated and very stressed out so she thought that she wasn't in the right frame of mind to make a decision either way. I wasn't going to make any kind of move on her as that would have made things even more complicated and wouldn't be a good start to a relationship. Also, we've hung out since then and had a good time it wasn't really awkward at all and we've also been able to talk about our discussion openly. 

Now how does this situation sound? We get along well and we like each other, she just wants to wait until the semester is over before she makes any kind of massive life decision.

21748,Breakups,1g9xvm,"Hi,
I am not sure why I am writing this. I guess it's just a way to relieve myself and convince myself I made a right decision.

In the end of 2012 I broke up with my girlfriend. We have been together for more than 6 years and living together for more than 4. She is a very beautiful woman (beautiful face and figure, that's not only my opinion; I am quite sure I won't find a girl that beautiful with also other qualities that would be a match with me). She is also very smart, she has finished masters as one of the best students at the university and currently she is finishing her PhD.

We have been happy for around 3-4 years. Although I have never had so many arguments with SO in my previous relationships, we always could come up with some solution that would satisfy both of us (usually thanks to my persistance and ability to discuss things without anger). In the beginning sex was OK - not perfect quality, but quite often. Then the quality increased, we learned each other, but we would not do it that often anymore. That was OK. But at some point it would be once per week, sometimes even two weeks if I wouldn't initiate it. I started feeling unappreciated, not loved (although I know she did love me). I started feeling bad. We talked about it, but she got it as I was demanding sex from her. At some point she did not want sex at all. I argued that if she does not want sex, she could at least relieve me (I have a quite high libido). She would give me oral, but sometimes would also look for excuses (she's tired, worked a lot, stressed, she has to get up in the morning). It was OK from time to time, but 3 days in a row was a bit too much for me. I never understood this, because I would always with love give her pleasure if she only asked (but she didn't have a need).

It became so bad I was irritated with everything she was doing. She used to close the door of my car with too much force (not necessary at all - it was a new Lexus) and I would go batshit crazy about it. Maybe because she would still do it although I mentioned it to her like 30 times. This and other similar situations made me feel that she does not listen to me and she does not care what I am saying. Last year we were at the bottom, we had no understanding for each other at all. I felt angry with her and I stopped doing anything for her (things like bringing flowers stopped already a year before).

We have talked about our problems during last 2 years and she would agree on my ideas, I would agree on her, it would be good for a week or two and then back to normal (read. baaaad).

She went for a conference to present her research and attend some courses. It was 3 weeks, she met nice people, they partied together. Before she went there she wanted me to come, but I asked her not to talk to me, give me some time, so I get rid of all the frustration and start missing her.

She felt bad with it, long story short - she met someone who told her she was pretty, smart and deserve much more from her life. They ended up having sex, twice (it was the end of her stay and then she came back). I found out from her behavior within 1 day, but she would not confess. I told her I had an affair 2 years before (the only time and it was not initiated by me; I also went out middleway and said I couldn't do it, so I quickly forgot and never mentioned it). I said that I am saying this because I want to start over and we should be honest. Then she confessed.

I would easily forgive her at that time (I didn't have pain or anything, it was really bad between us) if she promised that she would not continue writing with the guy (I knew she was). But she said, he is a really nice guy and she wants to talk to him and if she goes there again she would want to meet him and have coffee with him. That was something I could not bear. We were arguing a lot, but none of us could leave the apartment, so we stayed in one place. I said what I had to say and we stopped talking much. After some time she came and said, that she is not ready to do stop with the guy, because our relationship was so messed up and he helped her and she has feelings for him, but she wants to cut it off. She just needs time. I gave her time and she stopped talking to him (quite quickly and yes - I am sure). We had few nice dinners together, but things were not OK so we decided to go for vacation to try to fix things. And although the sex has never been better(she has never shown that she is into anything and now she really liked spanking and she started loving anal sex, which is my fetish and she was not a huge fan of before).

Unfortunately, sex is not everything. We still had issues, I could not get rid of an image of the guy banging her. I would bring it back often and I decided we won't find a way to fix it. We broke up. It was very painful for her in the beginning and I...finally felt free. I haven't felt so good in 3 years time (I think I might have had a light depression during some periods - nothing would bring me joy). Within 4 months I fucked more girls than in my whole life and...I wasn't happy (I thought I was missing on a great sex that she was not giving me)...Now it's more than 6 months, she went to the same place again (to give another presentation and of course meet her friends) and I am quite sure she is banging him (he's there too), which makes me sick. I don't want to talk to her anymore, although we have been on quite good terms until now.

I am quite sure we will never come back to each other, although I remember her saying, that maybe in 1 or 2 years we meet again and there will be spark. I am quite sure marriage after 3 years would save our relationship, but it's too late.

After the break up (until now) all women were just sex-objects, I could not look at a girl as a relationship material. I was immediately rejecting anything that could be a relationship. I think I was comparing or maybe afraid. Anyway, there was a girl that I knew she liked me. I was rarely writing her back, but she was quite persistent. 2 weeks ago I had nothing to do and she asked me out. I said OK, let's do that. She asked me if it was a date, I lauged and said sure. I went there just to drink some beers and talk, have a good time basically but nothing more. BUT...I started liking her, she's really nice and we have so much in common. We talk now everyday and we spend this weekend all by ourselves. She is younger, but very smart and good-looking. What I love about her is that she also has things that turn her on (sex-wise, fetishes etc.) and is not afraid of talking about it (I missed that with my ex). She also is much more conciliatory. And although it makes me feel good when I think about her and talk to her, it still hurts when I know my ex is with someone else...Sometimes I'm just at home and cry like a baby and I don't really understand why. I want to be happy and I just hope it will come one day...Why am I not happy yet?

I don't really have a question to you people, but if someone reads it and has some remarks, then I appreciate if you leave a comment.
Cheers to all of you!

**tl;dr**: Just a story of a random guy who was in a long term relationship, ended it and describes his feelings.","I [28M] broke up with my girlfriend [28F] of more than 6 years, frustration and betrayal.",0.0,False,10.0,28.0,1371140649.0,/r/relationships/comments/1g9xvm/i_28m_broke_up_with_my_girlfriend_28f_of_more/,Romantic
21750,Breakups,2c1ksg,"**Backstory** Met her sophomore year of college. Started hanging out regularly second semester. Junior year process to being together all the time &amp; basically living together. While we never officially defined ourselves as dating, we were pretty much a couple. Met each other's families, spent nights together, physically involved, etc. This went on for about 8 months.

About three weeks into the summer, she told me over the phone (we live four hours apart when not in school) that she thinks she's falling in love with someone else. I told her I still wanted to be with her, but I would give her space to do what she felt was right. I realized the distance &amp; our schedules prevented me from realistically doing anything to change her mind.

At the end of that, I asked if she'd consider giving us another chance. She said she couldn't give me hope that may not be there by saying yes, but she did say I didn't do anything that would make her not consider it. I mainly wanted to know if the other guy was the only reason like she said, or if it was something else she didn't want to say. What I got out of this was that I hadn't done or said anything to prevent her from getting back together with me in the future. But it's off the table for now.

I feel like it might be relevant to detail the other guy briefly. If it was just some random guy she'd met over the summer, I'd have a much easier time just writing her off. But she's known the guy far longer than me (about 8 years) &amp; they were very close. But as long as they've known each other, one or the other was dating someone else. This summer was the first time both were single &amp; while it hurts she chose him over me, I do understand her decision.

~'~

**Fast forward to this week**: Haven't talked to her in a couple months now. However, she contacted a mutual friend asking how to handle this semester. She said she still wants to see me, but doesn't know if I'm OK with it. He handled it perfectly &amp; told her I might be open to it, but to contact me &amp; ask before randomly showing up in a group setting. She did tell Hon about what happened at the beginning of the summer, but didn't indicate any further involvement with the other guy.

So here's where I'm at now. I don't want to lose her involvement in my life. She's still incredibly important to me, even if a relationship between us never gets another shot. I'm fairly positive the same thing is on her mind; we were best friends before becoming more involved. At the same time, I don't think I can handle just being friends with her. I hate to do this, because virtually all of her friends at college have been made through me. If I told our mutual friends I didn't want her around, they would side with me &amp; she'd essentially lose every friend she has. I wish I didn't have to do that, but I'm not willing to sacrifice my mental stability &amp; happiness for her, not anymore at least.

I just don't know what to do now. Before it's said, I realize I deserve someone who's not going to leave me if she thinks someone better could be had. But taking into account that we were not actually dating &amp; their history, I don't hold any hard-felons because she was up-front &amp; honest about everything. We were great together, but I understand emotions don't always make sense, especially when they've built for 8 years without a chance to explore them.

**TL;DR**: Girl I'd been taking to broke things off over the summer for another guy. They have a much longer history, but never have been single at the same time until this summer. She's contacted a mutual friend of ours &amp; says she still wants to hang out with me this semester. I don't think I can handle just being friends with her anymore-either we pick back up, or I'm cutting her out of my life. I'm not sure if I'm thinking clearly about all of this &amp; I could use some outside opinions.

21763,Infidelity,3bsyor,"Me and my gf have been together for 2.5 years, we moved in together 18 months ago.

We have been having some problems. She was getting really frustrated and upset with me for a few things. One is that I am currently working on my PhD which involves a lot of lab work. I have a tendency to work better in the evenings, and I work long hours. So I usually go to the lab at around 12pm-1pm and get home around 4am. She works a regular office 9-5 job. She says she wishes I would come home some evenings as she thinks we don't spend enough time together, and she gets annoyed because I play soccer on Saturdays, so in her mind this means she is way down my list of priorities.

But my work is really important to me, and I need soccer to get out the stress from work, but she doesn't seem to get that. Another problem she has is sex. We don't really have sex anymore - I am just usually too stressed/tired but she doesn't get that either. She will often try to initiate but I just am too tired and want to go to sleep. Then she will get really hurt and upset and say she feels rejected, and we'll have a long conversation (mainly her asking me why) and then I get even less sleep and am even more tired!

She has been spending a lot of time hanging out with her coworkers and has taken vacations with some of them because I can't take vacations yet because I have too much work on (another thing she doesn't get). She will normally get drunk with them and they go to bars or hang out at this house where four guys all live together.

So one night we were having the 'why won't you have sex with me' talk, and I got really frustrated and slammed my hands onto the bed in an effort to express my frustration and get her to shut up. I know it was probably the wrong thing to do, but she would just talk and talk and try to pry things out of me and all I wanted to do was sleep. She started crying, and then told me about this guy she hangs out with who is the roommate of one of her coworkers, and how he's been really flirting with her recently, and that it's made her feel better, and more wanted, and that she feels so guilty about it, but she wanted to tell me because she was feeling so unloved and craving affection that she was worried she might cheat with him. She cried and cried and said that if I could just take some time off or try a bit more with affection and sex it would make the world of difference and she just wants to be honest blah blah blah. Like I want to give her affection now after she told me about loving the attention from some other guy!!

Anyway I just didn't say anything because I had no idea what to say and just turned over and went to sleep. I love my girlfriend, but sometimes I just find it hard that she doesn't seem to get how much work I have to do and how stressful it is. 

We didn't talk about this other guy until a few nights ago she went out and didn't come home - she texted to say she was too drunk to get back home and was going to pass out on her friend's couch. She came back and acted like everything was normal all Sunday. I noticed she stayed up really late on Sunday night messing around on the Internet, which isn't like her as she usually has to be up for work early. 

Monday morning she didn't go to work, and I woke up around 11am and she was still there. She was sat at the end of the bed and when I woke up she started crying. She told me that on Saturday night she slept with that guy. She apologised over and over again and said she loved me, said she thought something was wrong with her as it was so out of character for her etc etc. I was pretty stunned - I hadn't actually thought she would do it, I thought she was saying that stuff before just to piss me off. I just told her that she can't go around and have sex with other people. She said 'I know' still crying. 

She said if I wanted to break up she would completely understand but she hoped we could work through it. I really didn't want to break up right then, so I just said 'No I don't want to break up but you can't just have sex with someone else' and made her promise not to do it again. She started crying even more, and then I realised I would be late at the lab, so I kissed her and I left. 

She was asleep when I got back and had gone to work when I woke up, and because of our different schedules we haven't seen each other since. I want to move past this but I'm just not sure how to handle this. I would've expected her to be calling or texting or something to apologise more or just anything really, as she normally sends me messages in the day. But she hasn't sent anything. She did leave me my lunch to take to campus. I just don't know what's up really and wish things could go back to the way they were.

I haven't told anyone else about this, but I know who the guy is and I really feel angry with him. I've met him before and see him around sometimes and don't know if I'll be able to control myself when I next see him. Basically I just don't know what to do. I don't want to break up, but I also don't like the thought of this guy and his friends all knowing what happened. Any advice? Anyone else made it work with a cheating partner?

Hello, so I'm posting here in an attempt to get some help. But more then likely I'm going to ignore the advice given and keep doing this anyway...

 So with that in mind I'll begin, I met a girl on reddit around late July-Early August of 2013. We were both 17 at the time. Things started off..badly as I was using fake pics for like the first week we talked. Decided to just say screw it and showed her the real me. She still liked me just the same and we began a long distance relationship, I live in Wisconsin, and she lived in Tennessee. She was a ballet dancer and everything from the start was fantastic!

 Fast forward to march of 2014, she's suppose to be coming for spring break...well she didn't. She was then suppose to come in May after she graduated andddd she didn't. Now, I knew she was real, so that wasn't a concern. However a few weeks later I came across her mothers cell phone number, when she lied about coming a third time, I gave her mother a call. 

 Turns out, she'd been dating a guy for a few months! I was devastated..but we decided she'd break up with her BF and stay with me. The following month was..different as it basically turned into a relationship where she was sending me nude pics/videos each day in an effort to earn back my trust. I should also mention that I was not exactly the perfect BF up to this point, when we'd argue I'd call her every name in the book. I also was one of the guys that would send 10 texts or call 10 times if she didn't answer.

 This time she bought a bus ticket (she showed proof of this) and told me she was coming at the end of July. The end of July comes...and she disappeared. Entirely. She messaged me on reddit a couple days later saying her mother took her phone when she learned of the ticket.

 I went ahead and used a texting app, got a new number and texted her a couple days later. Unsurprisingly she replied instantly. I then came to learn that she had moved to a college up north (I won't say what city to protect her identity), and yep. 

 We tried to be together (she replied maybe twice a week) until December where she ended up telling me that not only was she now dating someone from college, but was actually now living in his dorm!!!! 

 She..blocked me that day and I did some stupid shit by using a ton of different numbers in effort to keep in touch with her. This lasted until mid January where we had a really big argument, she told me she never wanted to see me again and that was that. I tried texting her a few more times, but eventually gave up. 

 Well, at the start of April me and her got into contact again due to some concern over some of the things she had sent. (I didn't post anything and never will, but someone was claiming to have them.) and we slowly began talking again..I came to learn she injured herself and can't dance ever again and lost her scholarship. 

 We have been talking again and she says her BF knows but seeing how me and her ended and the lies she told him, I'm almost 100% certain he doesn't know.  We've been talking more and are discussing meeting. And the topic of sex also came up...

 Now, I still love this girl, with all my heart, she's everything I could ever want. I've tried moving on, but I honestly can't. I don't really know what I'm expecting by posting here, but it's posted. I'd really like some advice, thank you.


TL;DR: Dated a girl for over a year in a LDR, never met, ended up learning she was in two relationships during that time. We began talking again recently.

Basically, I'm moving out to his area this summer for a job. We've known each other for a long time and always had a thing for each other. It just so happens that we both will be in the same place and want to make it work.

He made it very obvious to me how he feels and that while we aren't official yet, we are not to be seeing other people. He's said this plenty of times. I even have the texts. A few weeks ago he even asked me if I was seeing anyone else and I said no. He said that he's happy and doesn't want me to see anyone else. That he isn't either. So this is not a miscommunication at all. We're just waiting to solidify our relationship once I'm there in a few months.

Since I'm moving, I decided to get a Facebook. I had one a few years ago but got rid of it and now I want one again to keep in touch with my friends. Well, I go to add him on Facebook assuming he has one (we never discussed that he did). Yeah, I saw things I didn't want to see. He's tagged in a photo with this girl. She's sitting on his lap. He's holding her. People are commenting how cute they are. This was taken only a few weeks ago.

I look and see that she recently (like this week) that all of his cousins and friends added her. That is a huge sign to me and makes me sick. Clearly, she's someone of importance to him (his girlfriend?) for his family to be adding her and someone he's never mentioned. 

How do I bring this up without causing a huge fight if I'm wrong? He's a very defensive person and I don't want him to lash out at me for not trusting him or snooping. Trust is a big thing with him. Also, he could lie. He's lied to me before about some dumb things. When we catch up about our day and what not, he always tells me specific things he does and who he's with. So if he was with her, he lied about that.

I could have bought you more flowers, I could have surprised you more the way I had after we almost broke up our first time.  But to be honest I was probably a little preoccupied with making sure I could find a job in the area you would be so we could stay together.  And while my thoughtfulness didn’t result in you getting flowers, or surprised with chocolate, it didn’t mean I wasn’t doing enough.  I looked at myself in the mirror and I dealt with my jealousy issues, I did everything I could to make sure I could be the man you needed.  And what did I get in return? Literally the day before you went to that concert and I told you how it made me feel when you hung out with that group of boys, how it made me feel my jealous feelings, how I didn’t like how you would black out and put up with their inappropriate and disrespectful behavior, you go ahead and kiss one of them.  You cheat on me, after I do anything for you.  Rides to class everyday? Help on any homework assignment when I could be out enjoying my last days of college with my friends I won’t see in I don’t know how long?

But all I have to say is thank you.  Oh and the fact you cheated on me yet I was still willing to forgive you and work on whatever was wrong with us, but you say you need your space, only to try and hang on to me after I initiate no contact because that is what I think is the only way to win you back, then we break it, get in a fight, and you feel the need to tell me this break up is my fault.  You’re the one that cheated.  You’re the one that was unhappy.  Could I have done more? Yes.  Would I have done more if you had been mature enough and valued our relationship enough to tell me that so I can work on it and we can get through this tough time in our lives, let alone our relationship? Maybe.  But I will never know because you were too immature and broke up with me, the same way you threatened I would lose you the summer we were long distance before we were even dating, and the same way you used the attention you got from other boys to explain to me why I needed to do more the first time we borke up.  Thank you for making me realize what I need in a partner.  I need someone that loves the person I am, not what I do for them.  And I can’t wait for that person to come into my life and I can spoil them with flowers and chocolate because you didn’t have the patience to let me grow with you, and didn’t have the ability to look in the mirror yourself, the way you made me so many times.

21785,Breakups,1nzj2t,"M18 and F18 - 2-3 weeks.

All right, where to start. So first of all, I'm using a throwaway for obvious reasons. I started university about 3 weeks ago and during the first week I went over to my friend's flat to have drinks and go out with his flatmates. Whilst there, I meet an incredibly drunk girl who's a little bit all over the place but eventually her focus is on me and she starts attacking me with the occasional peck, I'm quite drunk so I go along with it as it was kinda fun. We start holding hands and hugging as we head over to the club with my friend's flatmates. By the time we get to get to the club we're getting along and I ask her if she wants to just go back to my flat, she obliges and we head back. I'll admit, all that was running my through my head at that point was the thought of just having a one night stand as I was very intoxicated and feeling quite frisky. 

Another thing to mention, I'm not exactly that experienced with girls. It seems that coming to university has opened me up a little bit and allowed me to step out of my shell and be a little more confident so that's why I thought it'd be easy to get away with a one night stand.
Anyway, back to the story. So we get back to my flat, lie down fully clothed and chat for a bit (sounds odd, but it was a little bit of a long walk and we just wanted to gain back our breath). As we talked more I found that there was a hell of a lot more to her than I thought, we shared a lot of interests, and it was just nice. We really connected and I could just talk to her so easily. Eventually we get into bed, not fully clothed but we didn't actually do anything. We just messed around a little bit, hugged and talked all night. So the next morning we arranged to meet each other at her flat, or the day after, I can't really remember. I ended up sleeping round hers that night and we did a little more. We never actually did IT, but we did nearly everything else the next few times we met up, we saw and stayed around each others places a few times and hung out fairly often.

So as we hang out more and get to know each other a lot better and through conversation I learn about past boyfriends, her depression and self harm. It doesn't seem like she's had the best experiences in the past. And that's part of the problem. I don't want to be another bad experience and that's why I can't figure out how to stop this from becoming a real relationship. I'm not a honestly not a bad person or a womaniser in anyway, I never set out to hurt anyone, and I really haven't done anything wrong in this situation or what the situation will become and yet I feel so incredibly guilty. She's not always having the best time at university and I think she really has her heart set on me becoming her boyfriend, she's starting to cheer up a lot now things are supposedly picking up between us and I don't want to affect that at all.

I don't want to just stop knowing her altogether, or stop seeing her. I just don't want a relationship, and no I don't want her to be a beneficial friend either, in case I was giving that impression. She's lovely, and we are really close, And I don't know if I'll be able to stop this from progressing into a relationship without damaging that. She came round mine last night, we had a laugh with my flatmates and we made dinner together, really couple-y kinda stuff. I was meant to say something then but it'd been such a nice night, and I still just don't know how to deal with this. I really can't figure out how to talk to her about this and end the intimate side of things without hurting her. I don't want to risk the friendship, we really have become pretty close and that's why this is so much more difficult. 

Some really sound and detailed advice would be a Godsend right now. My heads all over the place at the moment and I need to figure this out soon as the longer I leave it the worse this will get.

My problem is this, I keep going through experiences where I date someone and it keeps being alright.  I enjoy their company, but I'm not really attracted to them, or they aren't attracted to me, or they have to leave town really soon, or I can tell that they plain just don't feel all that excited about me.  Then there are people that I'm excited about that aren't interested in me (or are too far away, or are in relationships, etc...).

I've found that after a few of these things, dating just starts becoming hard.  Approaching people is difficult, it's hard to start up conversations and find people that have mutual interests and such.  After a while it becomes easier to just do nothing and hang out alone.

I broke it off with someone I was dating a month or two ago (or rather, they moved out of town, and we didn't feel like there was that much attraction) and I've noticed that since then I just haven't taken the energy to focus on meeting people and trying to get people's numbers or ask people out.

However, I know that in order to find a good relationship with a cool person, it takes effort on my part to go forth and make connections, I realize I'm not going to meet anyone just hanging around.  But at this point, my attitude toward dating is sort of bitter and wonders why I should try.  I've been in love before, and I want that again, but it just doesn't seem like a spark happens anymore.

While I was walking away she told me she took as many pills as she could find and tried killing herself. I responded (possibly like an asshole) by saying it wasn't my problem and walked away to my car. As I was walking away she was telling me how she was going to go home and do it.

21803,Infidelity,2gmzw9,"This is all in stream of consciousness so I apologize if I ramble in certain areas or ideas seem disjointed. I would love any advice.

My girlfriend and I have been together for 2 years. We're a great couple in many respects and being with her has been nothing short of happiness, truly. She gets me, I get her. I love her, she says she loves me. We live together, go to the same university, we have a cat together. We talk to each other about life post college (I'm going to medical school in a year and she's willing to stay with me through that arduous ordeal, we've talked about moving to a different city together...even have been so bold to bring up marriage at our young age). You know the deal about happy couples; I don't need to get into too much detail about it.

Here's the deal--for several months, our sex life had been dwindling fast. FAST. To put it into perspective, we might have sex (actual sex) a couple of times a month but, the majority of the time, we don't even get through sexy-time without her getting bored or finding the act a chore, rather than something pleasurable. I initiate sex, I'd say, 99% of the time and get shot down a lot ( &gt; 90% of the time). Most times, she just doesn't want to have sex and would rather just jerk me off just to satiate me and my high libido (an act she also finds a chore). She says she doesn't care much for sex and finds our relationship meaningful without receiving sex.

It took me a while but I convinced my girlfriend of how much of a problem this actually is in our relationship and she's finally come around to acknowledging it. However, it still took a while for her to want to do something about it. I am of the category of men that believes that its her body and while I would like more sex in the relationship, I can't change her natural libido or force her to do something she doesn't want to do or make her feel guilty in any way. It has to be something that's done on her own accord (obviously).

Well, time passed, and not much changed in our relationship and the sex life.

Anyways, this is all background information. A couple of weeks ago, we were at a dance party and my girlfriend not only refused to dance with me all night, but seemed un-attracted to the idea of dancing with me. I was fed up and confronted her that nothing has changed and that we're a passion-less couple. She admitted to me, that night, that she loved me, but was not in love with me. That she wanted to stay in a relationship with me but did not find me sexually attractive anymore. This explained the slow, gradual lack of sex in our relationship and whatnot. She was afraid that I'd break up with her that night (and maybe I should have...) but I thought we could do something to fix this! She and I have something special and I didn't just want to lose the love we had for each other so quickly.

Although I stayed with her, the last couple of weeks have been emotionally trying for me. I am, generally, a confident, outspoken man. Recently, I've looked at myself in mirrors and have asked myself--Why doesn't she love me anymore? I am second guessing my entire appearance, behavior, characteristics...just everything. My girlfriend said that she'd work on finding a way to fall in love with me again but, truth be told, there was nothing she was doing that reversed the way she made me feel that night she said she's no longer in love with me.

So there's problem one--she's no longer in love with me or finds me sexually attractive but still loves me and doesn't want to lose the stable, solid relationship we have built. I decided not to break up with her because I, too, enjoy this solid, stable relationship we have built and, I believed/still believe, that this is something we can work on and come out of stronger. Please believe me when I say that this girl genuinely does care for me. She's done many things for me that have been straight from the heart, out of love for me. I'm just unsure now if this love is like the love you'd give for an exceptional best friend or a lover.

Here's problem 2: Recently, I found out my girlfriend has been emailing a married man in his late 20s and the contents of the emails have been disturbing to me. I will admit, I was not looking to snoop, but my girlfriends laptop was available at a time when I left mine at a lab I work in so I decided to use hers to check my emails. She had been, recently, sending long emails when she is around me to some guy and when I'd ask her who it is, she'd say its just a friend. When I'd ask for more information about this friend, she'd get extremely defensive and think that I'm invading her privacy and that it's making her feel uncomfortable. Okay, I can see that, but maybe it would have been worth it to tell me more so to give me a peace of mind, right? Its a shame I had to find out this way. And yes, its clear that I have trust issues by this point. My girlfriend just told me that she doesn't find me sexy and, in a conversation that night, told me that she could see herself falling for another man while being in a relationship with me...

As I opened up the email tab on her computer, looking to log off, I see a long thread that, yes, gets my attention and curiosity provoked me into opening it.

It is a 60 message long conversation she is having with a married man. They exchange photos of each others faces, she says things like I've been waiting for your messages all day or what do you find attractive in a woman and things like I've never connected to anyone so much like I've connected to you. They plan on meeting up for lunch to get know each other more in person and the married man on the other side keeps complimenting my girlfriend and being flirty with her. Unfortunately, I can only interpret my girlfriends messages back to this man as flirty as well, saying things like you're handsome. She also says things disrespectful about my own friends in my fraternity (saying they all have to grow up, not realizing that most of them have gone on to be wildly successful in their careers or accepted to prestigious grad schools like Stanford, UChicago, or Duke). This also upset me a great deal too.  

At one point in this thread of messages, the man asks my gf if she has a boyfriend to which my girlfriend responds its complicated. She then goes on to tell this stranger, this mother-fucking, goddamn, son of a bitch, cheating-on-his-own-wife, stranger, about how its complicated because she recently told me that she loves me but is not in love with me and that our relationship is sexless. She tells him that she only told me that she doesnt need sex in our relationship just to keep me in the relationship that much longer and how guilty she feels having such a low libido compared to my high libido. She tells this thirsty ass weirdo on the other side about how she thinks that our relationship is probably going to last another couple of months before splits-ville. Then they go on to talk about what they find attractive in the opposite sex. In one message, the time stamp is at a time when she and I attempted sex and then I fell asleep. SHE MESSAGED HIM AFTER WE HAD SEX WHEN I FELL ASLEEP. LIKE WTF. THE WHOLE GODDAMN FUCKING STRING OF MESSAGES PISSES ME THE FUCK OFF. I need to know if ya'll, the reddit community, would find this blatant emotional cheating. I would never tell anyone that my relationship is complicated even if my GF and I were having problems and certainly not tell just anyone.

The idea that she would tell someone who is also interested in her is plain mean to me too. Clearly, he's going to hold out until my relationship with my GF ends and then swoop in...Honestly, while this saddens me a great deal, if my SO would rather take her chances on a complete stranger than someone who has consistently shown her love and more, then I don't want to be with her and I hope that karma bites both of them in the ass.

I brought this guy back up again recently and asked my girlfriend questions such as have you talked to this guy about me? or did you flirt with this guy? and whatnot. And she straight up lied to me every time I asked her these questions, thinking I did not know what the contents of the email really said. I tell her I don't know if I believe her and she then guilt trips me for not trusting her. The fact she can so easily lie to me is ridiculous. She eventually agrees to never message this guy again. That, too, I dont know if I can believe.

So reddit, what do I do? My girlfriend loves me, but is not in love with me. She says she wants to change that but then goes emotionally cheating on me with another married man. She says she wont message him again but I just don't have the capacity to trust in her anymore because she has proven herself to be a liar. Snooping was wrong, I'll admit, but it was the only way I could find out. My gut says to leave, but my heart won't let me because I love her still--despite all of this. I am tired of all of this however and can see myself breaking up with her soon. I'm just tired of the way she makes me feel. Help me figure out what to do from here. How do you gather the courage to break up with someone who treated you so shitty towards the end of your relationship, knowing that she was also the source of a lot of happiness throughout? How do you move forward? Would you consider the way she acted emotional cheating? Can I get over my trust issues? Should I give her a chance again? Halp pls.

I went out for grad day with a group of guy friends a few weeks ago, and one of them, let's call him V, was flirting with me throughout the day. He asked me to prom, and I excitedly said yes. The other guys in the group started congratulating him, saying, You're a man now, and then proceeding to tell me about how no one had said yes to him before.

In particular V and the guys told me that about a month before, he had asked one of my female friends out. She had horribly rejected him, telling him that she liked him as a friend. That rejection didn't sound so horrible to me, but I especially thought it was strange that they were telling me this within a minute of my saying yes... 

Fast forward, he asks me to be his girlfriend and the two of us go on a date. We have a nice time and each of us has our first kiss. I'm extremely looking forward to prom and I hang out with him and our guy friends at school for a few days... and some more red flags go up. He and the guys play a DS game (this is not the problem) in which they made Miis, some little characters of everyone male and female in the group. I have no problem with them gaming, as I like gaming myself (I don't have this game though). The problem is he spends a lot of the time playing with M's character (my friend who rejected him, M) and telling everyone about the funny things she's doing, more so than with any of the other characters he made. They're still friends though, so maybe I'm looking too far into this? Yet, she doesn't talk to him much, and it struck me as a bit odd. I haven't treated V any differently after this despite it making me uncomfortable.

Some other things -- I learned today that he didn't know how to spell my last name (it's not a long or difficult name), or that I very often wear glasses instead of contacts even though I've known and sat with him at our group's table at lunch throughout the past year. He then admitted that he didn't know all that much about me. Which I guess can be fine too, as we still have to get to know each other more. I'm just a little let down in that I've spoken and laughed with him a lot in the past as friends, and that he never was interested enough to remember. When I like someone, I know their name and their face by heart. Anyway, the name/glasses thing wouldn't mean much to me if I didn't know how recently he had liked my friend... or how he was the only guy in his group of friends without a date... or how I was the only girl with them the day he asked. His interest in me has seemed to die down lately; he no longer waits for me (so I wait for him now) at lockers, hugs me, or says goodbye when he leaves (it's basically gone back to the way it was when we were just friends), while he seemed genuinely excited to do all that at first.

I like you so much and you’re so important to me. The thought of not having you in my life is scary and so sad it almost physically hurts. You can be the sweetest, kindest, funniest, most romantic person with me sometimes. But if I stay with you after this, give you yet another chance, then it’s telling you and it’s telling myself that it doesn’t matter how I’m treated. That I care about being with you more than I care about myself. That I can be lied to and manipulated and controlled. That I’m not good enough for anything better. That you can keep me controlled with portions of the truth so I don’t run away. Because you know your actions would make anyone run away. I don’t want a boyfriend who needs a perfect fantasy. I want a boyfriend that thinks I’m perfect. I know I’m very far from perfect, I’m not stupid. But sometimes I see these people, sometimes they’re not pretty at all and the way their partner looks at them.. I want that. I want to be somebody’s sunshine and sexual everything. If I stay with you then I’m telling myself I don’t deserve that. I’m dooming myself to failure because I will never match your fantasies.



I don’t want another boyfriend who creeps on girls. The lecherous lurker in the corner who looks shiftily at women, fucking them in his head, but he’s too scared to even talk. The ‘creepy porn guy’. This is behaviour I’ve seen a lot and I look down on it and I disdain and I ‘verspotten’ it. I think I project my disgust onto you because it makes me feel disgusting. I don’t want another boyfriend who needs porn and fantasies more than he needs me. Who will never quite think I’m what he wants because I can never be a fantasy character. Who disrespects me because he’s always looking around at other women. Who ignores me to fantasise about some woman on the train walking on his dick, when I’m feeling so happy about us, when I give him everything I can, when I’m right there in his life but overlooked. The memories of the places we went together, nice dates we went on – it’s all tainted now because it was never just you and me. I feel sick to think of the thoughts you have so often about just any woman in a nice outfit. The fact that you’re perfectly happy to continue seeing the world through a porn lens, to dehumanise and objectify women and neglect and disrespect and hurt your girlfriend. The jealousy would drive me crazy. You will never truly appreciate me or make room for me in your life as long as you’re like this. And if I stay with you then I’m saying that’s all I deserve. Just to be one of many. Not one. I always felt like other women were the threat but the threat was only ever you.



You live so deeply in fantasy that I can’t fit into your life. You’re in love with a fantasy that you’ve created – I don’t think it’s even about those girls anymore. You’ve created an ‘ideal’ that nobody will ever be able to match You have made your decision so many times and it has never been me. This was meant to be our fresh start. Where you understood that I have a right to honesty, where you work on your problems, where we can finally have a healthy relationships. Instead you carry on lying to me, calling me psycho when after so much built up expectation, I struggle with the truth. And after so much experience of your lies, I don’t believe the ‘truth’ you’re telling me. The expectations didn’t develop in my head. You made me live in fantasy too. And as long as I’m here, nothing will change. I told myself I'd give it minimum 6 weeks, maximum until I got my uni offers. But this progress isn’t enough for me. After almost a month, still watching porn every 2 days and saying ‘its not my fault I’m an addict’ – it isn’t enough. by using the excuse ‘I’m an addict’ you keep yourself an addict. I have lost this competition every single time. So now I have to take myself out of the competition before I lose myself completely. I really hope for your sake that this all changes. Otherwise you’ll be 40, alone, all your friends will be married with families. And the only women in your life will be porn stars, prostitutes and the fantasy images of girls from your teenage years who didn’t care about you then and won’t care about you now. You’ll be miserable and truly lonely and you’ll only have yourself to blame.
I’ve been here and I’ve been waiting for you and I’ve been so loyal to you. but these promised changes just aren’t going to come because you’re complacent. If you want to tell your friends that this is because of my ‘psychoshit’ then do so. But I hope you can admit the reality to yourself soon because that’s the only way you’ll change. There was a reason I asked the same questions so many times, that I always suspected something. I just always knew that something was really off. I always thought (and you often told me) that I was the problem. I appreciate that you’ve finally been honest with me (probably not about everything) but now it’s just gone too far. You have lied to me throughout our entire relationship. You saw me falling hard for you but you kept me away with these fantasies and lies. I really hope you manage to change this. For you. I’ll move on and I’ll find someone else and maybe after a while my confidence will get back up. This stuff is not all that you are but you’re letting it control your life. I hope one day you’ll manage to live in reality because you’re stealing your own life from yourself. If you get help and if you make some real changes then it would be nice if you want to get in touch again. But for now I can only say goodbye and good luck with everything. I’ll really miss you'



It's not just harmless porn viewing or harmless fantasies. he watches porn 3 times a day. the longest he's ever gone (even before me) is less than a week. we've had serious conversations, i've told him i understand it's hard to go cold turkey, all i've ever asked for is honesty. time and time again he's lied to me, saying it's 'psychoshit' when i don't believe him. he builds me up with what i want to hear and then breaks me down with the truth. he fantasises about girls he liked when he was a teenager. at the beginning of our relationship he alluded to 'girls i was in love with who didn't know i existed'. he has fallen in love with his own fantasies and they take higher priority than me. when he sees a woman on the street in heels he visualises her trampling his dick. so often he's said that he needs it and then denies it and says it's just fun. but i hate the thought that he won't be in my life. i don't know whether to try and deal with it, wait it out until he resolves his addiction, bitterness and history. or whether to make a clean break.

One Sunday evening he picked me up at my house and brought me ice cream- I thought things were going well. We drove to our old high school, where we met and fell in love. It was pretty poetic I guess. 

Anyways, we talked for hours about high school, college, how much things have changed, and how his family's rocky relationships are affecting him. I knew things weren't going well when he mentioned that he thinks his parent's marriage is failing because they started dating at such a young age. So naturally I began to cry- the pain was unbearable- I even threw up.

He first mentioned taking a break, but I have never really believed in breaks. I wanted a real answer from him- did he want to be with me or not? But he could not give me an answer. I know he is really struggling.

He said he felt tied down, and he didn't want this feeling at 20 years old. He told me this wasn't happening because he wanted to explore other people (I asked him, but I am not dumb), but because he wants to be alone to figure out life for himself. He wants to be independent. 

This was a hard thing for me to hear because I have always felt independent, but I have always enjoyed spending time with him. The past three years we've talked about moving in together after college, getting a dog, what our wedding song will be- and he brought up many of these things as things that he wanted as well.

I guess it's just hard for me to believe that you can love someone and not want to be with them. But I am doing what I can do make myself a better person and I am trying to move on. Even though I would take him back in a heartbeat if he showed up at my door.

She doesn't see me in her future, as doesn't think I'm the one. She said she will always care for me, but as a friend. I don't know how I can go back to being just that.

We were together only six months, but I'm still so messed up over her. I've put everything of hers away, unfriended her on facebook, and every other social site, but everytime I see something cool, or amazing, I want to tell her about it, and how my day was, and it hurts.
my heart hurts when I think of the other guys she's going to meet, and  and kiss, and sleep with, and they aren't me.

My friends are far away, but I'm throwing myself into my work, and I'm eating right, Gymming,  exercising more, but I live alone, so eventually there's just the silence in my flat to come back to.

Recently, she told me that she's been feeling out of sorts, not happy with her life, etc. We were planning on moving down to San Francisco together, as I got a job offer, but out of the blue after months of planning she told me she's not sure if she wants to live with me.

I didn't react well, we fought, and I told her I didn't want to do long distance again. 

We went on a trip for her birthday and a week after she told me that she wasn't sure if she wants to be with me or not. 

We have always struggled with communication. I'm a journalism major and communication is something I'm very passionate about. Her, not so much. She's very shy and introverted, as well as independent, so she doesn't always tell me what's going on. She brought that up and said that she doesn't feel understood. She also told me that she feels like her only option is to follow me wherever I go. 

I told her that I love her and I want to be with her, but that she needs to do what's right for her. After about four hours of talking she left. 

She basically said that she just needs to find out if she can do it on her own, if she can chase her dreams, be self reliant, and have a time of independence. That was 4 days ago. 

She texted me this morning saying she saw a gif I'd enjoy about a lizard. I texted her back saying it sounded cool. 

I'm torn between my personal desire to have her back and the fact that she feels that she needs freedom. I don't want to lose her and I'm terrified she'll never come back. I realize that sometimes we just need to figure stuff out on our own, and I really want to do what's right. 

I really want advice on what to do. I'm going to call her in a week just to ask how she's doing, not to meet up or get her back, but just to find out if she's ok. I wrote her a letter that I'm going to revisit at that time, and I'll decide whether to deliver it later or not.

21838,Infidelity,2k2r3h,"My gf and I just broke up from a 3 year relationship (33/m and 30/f). We have been living together for 2 years. Things have been going downhill for a while, I guess, and our relationship was lacking in communication and there was already some complications with trust issues. We didn't actually have a lot of time to do much together and only saw each other the few hours before bed and eat dinner together and our days off didn't sync often. I was still actually very content with the relationship, and thought we had just settled into having our hobbies and doing things together as often as possible. 


I initiated the  breakup with her because I found out that she was inviting some male co-workers over to get drunk with her while she house-sat for a co-worker. She knew already that I was uncomfortable with her making herself so vulnerable and putting herself in an environment of only men when getting intoxicated, but she thinks that it is harmless because  they are work-friends and she didn't invite them over with the intention of hooking up with anyone.


I stopped by where she is house-sitting to talk and see if we were going to try to fix things. She basically just said that she couldn't promise it wouldn't happen again, and I don't know if she thought I was going to just accept that and work around it. I told her that it was a deal breaker, if she was going to lie to me about who she hangs out with and drinks alone with men then we're done. 


I guess I was hoping she would come running and promise that she wouldn't put herself in that situation anymore. So I did the worst imaginable thing, I sat in the parking lot and waited to see what would happen. One of the guys she was hanging with showed up. It was enough for me to get out of there. The guy is married but showed up really late and my she is acting like its just a friend to talk to about our breakup. I know I already messed up by being creepy and hanging around the apt. I just had to have some kind of verification of my suspicion that she was probably cheating on me or at least putting herself in the position to cheat. But could any wife really be okay with her husband going out in the middle of the night to console a lonely female co-worker?

update: This really sucks. She had actually invited a few of the co-workers over in a group chat but says no one came over, then on Sunday they were supposed to be having a small party with a few guys (one gay, one married, one in a relationship whose girlfriend was going to come, and another guy). I went to the party late because I wanted to just let her hang out with co-workers for a while, she doesn't have many other friends and I wanted to show her I trust her to be cool in that situation, but when I got there there were no other girls and she was wasted. We fought about it and after 2 days I decided to say it was over.  The married guy asked her to hang out, she says because he saw that she was distressed at work.

FWB since November. Feelings have entered the picture. I would get upset with him because he is bad with his phone and I could never understand why he wasn't constantly wanting to talk to me (I know, ridiculous). When I would be passive-aggressive upset with him, he would tell me that he really likes my company and he hoped we were okay. He even called my best friend one time trying to figure out why I was unhappy. We would see each other at the bar we both frequent and everything would be okay. 

**As of Recently**
I finally told him that I liked him before I left for the week for vacation. (Have been too scared to actually tell him - so showed it with affection instead). He told me he likes me too, that I'm the only one he sees, that he likes to be around me. I tell him I don't like it when he goes for a couple days without texting/calling me. When I asked him if he had sex with anyone else and to be honest, he said he did with someone a month ago. I got angry and he told me he just wanted to be honest with me and that we weren't as serious as we were now. I decided it really wasn't a big deal anyway since we were never official. 

I leave and see how long it takes for him to contact me. It has been 10 days without a word and I have decided I don't want to see him anymore. My friends think he's stringing me along anyway and I'm pretty tired of being confused and upset by him.  My problem is that he is very charming, funny and sweet. I adore his personality and I know when he sees me again he will try and charm his way back (it has happened before). I'm wondering what I should say when he tries to talk to me.

I thought I'd get some advice on how I ask girls out. I realize I could be doing some things better, but just wanted some outside opinions and advice on what I do specifically. This works a good amount for me actually. I commonly go up to girls (almost always they are working at a restaurant or store I am at, I am working on approaching girls otherwise), say Hi you are really beautiful and I was wondering if I can take you out? , (I will only say it if I truly mean it).  
  
I am confident and have no problem going up to girls and talking to them, and it works about 20-25% of the time, and the only time they have said no is because they say they have a boyfriend (I realize a lot of girls will say this as an excuse as not to hurt someones feelings). But the girl is usually really flattered and will mention how nice it is of me to say that. 

I think a lot of girls can get defensive in this situation, and would just tell me that they have a boyfriend as a quick response.

21850,Dating,25obmz,"Apologies in advance if this is long, but I want to give you all the details to help you form an educated opinion.

I'm working through that time in a single person's mid-twenties where he or she realizes that a lot of his/her friends have either moved away, are busy with their careers, or are getting married/having babies. Basically, in January, I realized that I need to start getting out, meeting some new people, and making new friends. To aid me in this new stage of my life, I started going to a local brewery bar alone, in hopes I would connect with some different and interesting people. I go every week on the same night, and rarely miss a brewery sesh.

I have met a lot of cool people, but one in particular I can't figure out is the bartender at said brewery. He is exactly my type of guy that I'm attracted to, but I didn't give him much thought other than just thinking he's a cute guy until very recently. We have a lot in common, like sports and beer and music, and we'd occasionally chat about these things when business was slow. He remembers what teams I like and teases me if said teams lost, and I'd give it right back to him about his teams. He also teases me about a band I love but he hates. Just seemingly flirty banter, but I'm very awkward with guys and can't really tell if they are flirting or are just being friendly - especially with a bartender when business is slow. He also loves my dog, who I bring in the bar occasionally because it is pet friendly. 

One night, I stayed until close because my phone died and I lost track of time. I was chatting with this older lady, and her husband had been talking to the bartender, who was drinking beers on the customer side of the bar because it was last call and he was just waiting for people to leave. I overheard the bartender talking to the older guy about how he was kind of sad because his girlfriend of two months had just dumped him. Coincidentally, I was sharing with the older lady that I was single because I just ended a brief relationship that was clearly going nowhere. The older lady, knowing both sides of the story awkwardly shouts, Hell, you two ::points at me and bartender:: should date! You both like [sports team]! Go out! Bartender and I both sat there very awkwardly, not knowing what to say. Then Older Lady looks at bartender and says, Don't you think she's cute? Bartender replied, Yes of course she's cute. I looked at him and said, I think you're cute too. That was it and he didn't talk to me for the rest of the night. This seems like a good thing, but what if he just said I am cute because he was pressured into it? It's not like he can be like No she's a hideous troll because that is rude.

Since then, our regular customer/bartender relationship has remained the same - us talking about our common interests and slight teasing. He's always the one to start talking to me, and every time I'm there, my tab is less than it should be, meaning he is either sucky at entering peoples' drinks, or he's giving me free ones. I also think I overheard him telling his best friend, who is also a regular on the same night as me, that he thinks I'm cute, but I can't be sure. (His best friend replied, Well, she has big tits. Which I do.)

Also, one night, I asked him to play my favorite band on the Pandora and he did - the next time I came in, he put the station of my favorite band on without me asking.

Anyway, I think despite being a bartender, he might be a bit socially awkward, as am I. I friended him on Facebook recently because I accidentally discovered him through a mutual friend, but he hasn't acknowledged my Facebook presence. As I mentioned, I'm weird with guys, so I'm not sure if he's being flirty and interested, or if he's just chatting with me, giving me free drinks, and calling me cute to miscellaneous people because I'm a good regular and tip very well (I was a bartender for a couple years, so I always take care of my service people.) I feel like I can't really ask him out at work because, work, but I'm not sure if there's a way to maybe pursue this possible mutual interest.

I also feel I should mention that I recently lost a lot of weight, and am having a weird time adjusting to the fact that guys might possibly find me attractive. 

So, Reddit, based on what I have said - do you think he might like me or is he just making sure he doesn't lose a regular who tips 100%? If he likes me, what's a cool way to give him my number or a way to get in touch with me without putting him in a weird spot because he's at work and I'm a valued customer? (Although I thought I did this by adding him on Facebook?)

Thanks in advance for any advice!

I don't really think the first one is an issue, I made that clear very early on and she stayed with me. About the part of going out, I never kept her from friends or forced us to stay cooped up inside. I tried to be really outgoing which is not something I'm accustomed to, and it's not like I couldn't have made a greater effort when she brought this up as an issue. Point is I'm not really sure wtf happened. Anywho, during the break up she asked if I wanted to remain friends. I declined because I knew I would need time to clear my head.

Anyway, my relationship with her is very confusing and it could help to use a fresh set of eyes. I remember when I met her, I was a total Nice Guy^TM who was extremely bitter about being single for so long. Despite that, we became good friends, and in the year and a half I have known her, I have done a total 180, and she was the catalyst. Without her, I would still be in a terrible place mentally, and I wouldn't have the confidence in myself to know that I could survive this breakup (which I have, it just takes effort). Honestly, if she and I hadn't met, I would have probably turned to a certain community on reddit that is reviled for being misogynistic and cult-like (if you can guess).

My relationship with her lasted from the middle of April to the beginning of August. She cheated on me, and told me that she did (I wouldn't have found out otherwise). I forgave her after a lot of thought, because I figured she wouldn't hurt me like that again. When we broke up however, I was a bit blindsided. She was my first girlfriend, and it hurt to lose that, because I loved her a lot (and still do, though the nature of my love has changed a bit).

We still talk a lot, but sometimes, she kinda does push me away, and other times, she doesn't. My relationship with her has never been completely platonic, but she and I have also never really been physically near each other by virtue of her situation and mine as well. I just don't know how to handle all of this. It is all new to me.

As far as my impact on her, I am one of the reasons that she reached out for help regarding the way her parents treated her. They did abuse her more than a lot, especially emotionally.

Friday 5th. First date. It went so well. We had couple of beers, lots of eye contact, good conversations, physical attraction, intellectual stimulation, laughter ... basically the perfect first date. 

We spoke a bit during the beginning of the following week. Talking about exhibitions at museum we might want to go to. On the thursday 11th, I send him a text, asking what he was up too. He says he's home. I ask if he wants to meet. He agrees. We meet, we talk, we have fun, the attraction is getting overwhelming for both of us, we have sex.

No writing response. 10 minutes later, he posts pictures on his facebook showing he is with friends making dinner. (extra detail: there was no activity on his facebook for the last months)

I finish the email saying that if he does not want to see me again, I would highly appreciate an answer and that yes or no will do. I'm not looking for explanations or anything, I just want to empty my mind and move on.

Extra details: During the week of chatting, I told him that I did not want to get involved emotionally. He though it was great, he told me he was also looking for a relationship where only the intellectual and sexual sphere are involved. 

Now, the chemistry was so great. We had sex 4 times that night. He would kiss me passionately, hold me in his arms, he kept me an extra hour after i told him i as gonna leave ... 

I believe attraction could be stronger on one side that the other but that kind of chemistry and feeling of knowing that person even if you don't really, those things does not occur when it's only one party feeling that way ... 

He recently activated his gmail chat (which, as of the first contact, I asked him to do. He told me that fb chat was easier and he didn't know how to activate the chat ... but apparently he found out how ...) 

I realized that I'm not completely close to emotional involvement. It's just that i'm not looking for emotional relationship, I want the emotions to find me ... 

Anyhow, I cant stop thinking about him ... It's been almost 2 weeks he keeps silence. The guy is shy and is not the type of dating multiples girls (my best friend is a coworker of him and she confirmed that he is reserved and quiet) so what should I do ? 

Move along or persevere ? 

I'm very perseverant. I was thinking about sending him a handwritten letter. I would love to receive one ... but would he ?

Hi. I am a guy who has not been great at dating almost at all; pretty inexperienced in almost everything, never went further than 3 or 4 dates therefore never had any kind of relationships in my life (except the one I ended when I got into college, it was for 19 months but I don't really think it was something real) – I tend to romanticize everything and invest in people emotionally too early too quick, I know, that sucks and I am aware of that. - Anyway. WALL OF TEXT, BEWARE:


Last week, I'm on one of those dating sites, see someone in my area on 'Nearby' section, randomly message her and bam, we start talking. She's a foreigner, here for holiday, seeing her friends. We try to decide a time to meet but it takes a while to figure it out. Last weekend, we agree on meeting for a drink or two, conversation goes just smoothly, start with usual things and goes on with these 'how come you're alone?' thing... Everything goes great. Add each other on Facebook and stuff. At some point she hints that she has to take off soon as her friend might fall asleep any time, I say she could crash at my place if she wants. She says 'I don't know, maybe next time, drinks on Tuesday sounds good?' and gives me a smirk which gives me an instant shiver heh. Anyway, we take off, walk a while and start holding hands playfully and she starts calling her friend who doesn't pick up immediately which is a great thing for me as I press more for her to go to my place and list my reasons for it, she says has a work to submit early in the morning, can't come but I'm almost convincing her. As I almost manage to achieve my goal, her friend picks up and she has the excuse to leave now. Asks when I'm free again, says 'Sunday?', I reply 'yep, Sunday evening is great' - we kiss for a couple of time, then part ways.


Half an hour later, pops on Facebook says 'sorry for ditching, got an early deadline ;) we can meet up tomorrow maybe?' Which I gratefully agree. During the next day, she tells she's meeting her friend and I'm welcomed to come along then we can see how it goes; I insist for little privacy then she says, ok, I'll meet you after this. I say OK. We meet at somewhere near my place, head home and spend great time together. We start fooling around, I tell her that I’m pretty inexperienced she says it’s ok. We have sex, I suck at it, say I’m sorry, she says it’s ok and we should just enjoy ourselves and I’m worrying too much, we talk about past experiences, we get sillier and sillier, I make her cum bla bla... We just have the perfect night. I get up in the morning, leave for work letting her sleep in and agree to meet either the same day or the next. No promises and I get it. We don’t get to meet the same day but we meet up for coffee the next day which becomes a late lunch with her friend before she heads to another meet up with her friends (she has lots of them, it seems). I’m obviously upset about it, thinking I screwed this up too and she’s just seeing me that day for the sake of seeing me. But a bit after we meet, we get closer and closer, holding hands and stuff again in front of her friend and during conversation, she says she’s going to come back in couple of months and wants to see me again, contrary to what she normally does, also says I could go to her country/city and stay with her. Her friend leaves, we go to somewhere else and get cozy. I’m obviously happy about this as hell. She says we can meet up again before she leaves.


This doesn’t happen due to some technicalities, her departure gets delayed for another two days, we try to make plans again to see each other one more time but can’t find the time for it. I ask her if I could see her off at the airport. She says ‘aw, but that’s too far, you don’t have to’... I kind of insist, a bit panicking, she in the end gives in initially, then says she might find some time on her last day after I’m done working (which is around midnight, yes, luck) and I say ok, I’ll check in in the evening. Before I do, she says she can’t make it and tells me don’t come to airport ‘cause it’s bit too much and we can keep in touch. I say I was worried about making her feel uncomfortable and I’m sorry, I wasn’t trying to make this something more or anything. She says it’s ok, it’s really sweet of me and she appreciates it, but it’s just too much. I say ‘see, I’m bad at these things, I told you’ and she replies ‘you’re not bad at anything’ - I kind of knew I was making her feel uncomfortable all along, but just wanted to see her one more time, that’s it.


Anyway. This is my story. I like this girl. She obviously likes me at a certain level. We want to meet again when she comes back. Of course I can’t tell if she was really genuine about this whole stuff but her acts seemed real and genuine, otherwise I wouldn’t bother writing here I guess. I want to keep in touch, without letting it fizzle out or become overwhelming, but I have no clue about how to do it. I think I need some kind of guidance and big help on this – kind of a roadmap or something. As I said in the beginning, I tend to romanticize everything and invest in people emotionally way too early too quickly. I don’t know how I kept it cool up until this point, but I somehow did and I intend to keep it so. I don’t have many people around me and definitely less people to talk about this. I need help, so please, help me : )


TL;DR: I met a foreigner who’s on holiday here. We liked each other, had sex, saw each other three times in total over the course of a week and now she’s going back to her country but wants to see me again, when she comes back in a couple of months, saying she normally doesn’t see people twice. She wants us to keep in touch until then. I normally get excited about this stuff a lot and screw it up.

21877,Breakups,3cpmmx,"I was doing good when I got out of highschool. I had money saved up from a small inheritance, I had a fun job, and I had a best friend that I was going to get an apartment with. My first serious relationship was over and I felt great about my future. I was gonna take classes, too. I met my boyfriend Adam [26M at the time] around this time and we clicked immediately. Finally, things were coming up roses.

Where I am now: jobless, depressed, in debt, and living next door to my mother, which may as well be the same as living with her since she owns the place. Also, I don't really have any friends anymore. I had to stop hanging out with them, because Adam convinced me that I should only need him. The few friends I barely kept went radio silent when they got tired of seeing me drown. All of my money went to Adam's car, which broke down, his drug habits, his bail when he got arrested over an old fine he never paid. The list goes on. I cared too much, I loved him too much, so much so that I have let myself be dragged down by him. And the worst part? He doesn't even act like he likes me. He recoils when I kiss him. When I cry, he yells at me. Any time I make a budget or try suggesting he spends less, I'm called controlling. The good times are good, but I can't even enjoy them because the bad never gets resolved. I reach out to him, try connecting to him, and get shut down. 

Things are now the worst they have ever been. We have an eviction notice for 7 days (from my own mother, even she is sick of this). Here is the dilemma: I can get out. I can leave state and live with my brother and get my act back together. I can recover. My logical side is telling me that this is best for myself to ensure I don't get further damaged financially or emotionally. But it doesn't feel like an easy decision to make, because it would require completely abandoning Adam, possibly leaving him homeless because he has no job. He will have my car and that's it. Regardless of how he treats me, it is killing me inside to imagine myself doing okay in another state while he suffers alone. I'm breaking up with him either way because we are too different. As a human, not as my boyfriend, I don't want to leave him in my dust. 

I'm so fucking conflicted. I can get out of this so easily, and rationally I need to start thinking of myself. But I can't. I can't stop caring about what happens to him. I can't stop stroking his hair when he's hungover, even when he spent the previous night drunkenly insulting me. This is so unhealthy and I know it. I fucking hate myself for even being in this, because I should have done something sooner. Now I'm faced with probably the hardest decision of my life: get out of the water and leave him to drown, or keep trying to save him, possibly sinking with him.

I'm so upset, I will take anything. Because I'm stuck and really have no one but you guys right now.

We are taking 2-3 weeks on our own and then talking to see what we want to do long term  Originally I never believed in breaks and thought either stay together and work it out or just go your separate ways but I have started to to see a benefit and now realize I needed this as much as her.

We have had a lot of issues for the past year or 2 and I am not surprised given we are in our early 20s and just graduated from college.  I got a job immediately after graduating and she stayed working retail.  

I believe the  worry of college debt, not being in a career/desk job really got to her.  I also didn't help over the last couples years with my own insecurities came out by making her feel bad if we didn't have sex, talking down to her about little things (didn't realize I was doing but now I realize), constantly making joking comments about her cheating were done way too consistently by me and led up to this point.  

I feel confident that when we talk in a week or 2 that we will be on the same page.  Either break up completely or stay together.

If I didn't get this type of kick in the ass I don't think I would have been able to see what I was doing and why I was going it.  Also it is allowing me to analyze what is love vs being dependent/not wanting to be alone. 

I am wrong in thinking that a break is actually the best case scenario?   Also if I don't hear from he in another week is it okay to initiate the conversation and see if she is ready to talk?  I don't want to push her until she is ready.

21884,Breakups,2bzgwl,"So me and my girlfriend have been having an extremely rough stretch this past couple of weeks, me fighting with her and all that and we decided to call it quits. Mainly because I just didn't feel appreciated for everything that I do for her, and also because I guess in the upcoming Fall semester I won't have time for her; she is extremely needed and needs my presence constantly, which I kind of like because when we are not arguing we get along better than anybody I have ever met.

But that's besides the fact; I am progressing through school very quickly and hopefully will be continuing on my education in a graduate school somewhere. She on the other hand is kind of at a standstill in academics and I highly doubt I will ever see her graduate (I have never told her this, but she has chosen a hard major which is kind of out of her intelligence quota :( I still love the girl to death).

Now I end up spending endless hours with her homework and helping her study, and I guess I am just kind of fed up with it because she is getting nowhere and doesn't realize it. She is in constant demand for more and more from me; not just my time but also buying her things and taking her on trips and whatnot. Now I love the girl and love spending on her, but I just don't see any appreciation out of it. Our sex life is dull, maybe once a week, and we are still very young. This has caused some arguments.

I think it's a bit of Stockholm syndrome haha, I feel bad for her because she is not progressing through life as I am, but I am also in need of a more mature woman and fun woman. I want a woman that we can go out for drinks and have interesting conversations (she does not drink); but I'm also torn because she is cute and weird behind closed doors just as I am which lets me escape from grown-up duties (I know I'm only 24 but am extremely independent and studious with academics and work). 

I guess I am just torn and looking for some advice, and things to keep my mind off of her. We have been breaking up and getting back together the last month now because she will send me a text with something cute, and I always cave in. But I also want a woman, who has goals and can go out and have a drink and loosen up.
 I feel I am at a point in my life now, where why date a girl for so long if I never see myself marrying this girl. Maybe I just need to play the field and concentrate on my schooling and PhD and have fun with some ladies.

21888,Infidelity,2s815e,"Two of my exes cheated on me and it left me quite devastated. I couldn't trust girls anymore. So I didn't trust them. I've had some shallow relationships in the meantime and prevented myself from being extremely jealous by not opening up.

Now I'm in a relationship with an incredible girl, I didn't know such girls existed. She's caring, loving and supportive, full of respect and capable of showing that she loves me even when we argue. Because of all that and more, I opened up emotionally. But the moment I did I became very jealous (even though she gave me no reason) and scared that she might cheat on me eventually, and I don't know if I couldn't handle being cheated on by a girl whom I'm ready to give everything I've got.

In an idiotic night filled with jealousy I created an online dating profile and messaged one girl. It went well and now we set up a date for the day after tomorrow. The girl seems to be head over heels for me way too soon. And now I feel incredibly guilty and don't want to go through with it. No way am I going through with it. 

I absolutely can't make my girl feel the way I did before. I know the guilt would gnaw on me forever. Hell, it's gnawing at me right now, and it's not nice.

I realized that there's no way my girl is, or in the near future will, cheat on me. Considering how much time we spend together, the logistics of cheating would be nigh impossible. Also, I know she would feel just as guilty as I feel now and she couldn't go through with it.

So I fucked up.

I wanted to be the first to cheat so I don't get hurt if she cheats (you're a dick, but so am I - I don't blame you). I wanted to distance myself from her through cheating so I don't feel so abnormally jealous. All of that seems quite idiotic right now.

So, **my question is**, how do I call off the date without the girl going all berserk and ruining my relationship. She doesn't know much about me but with reasonable googling skills she could reach my facebook profile and see that I'm in a relationship.

I learned my lesson. I just want to go back and avoid the consequences of having flirted with that online girl, as weaselly as that sounds. I don't want to ruin the trust between me and my girlfriend over something I *know* will never happen again.

Also, any tips on ridding myself of my pathological jealosy?

I know I did bad things (intending to cheat and now trying to cover it up) and I know some of you will tell me that I'm a dick (and I can't quite disagree), but I hope somewhere in the comments there will be someone offering some help too.

I'm 22f he's 23m of two months

I need help understanding a ridiculous situation. My current boyfriend Dave and I are in a second relationship with each other.


The first time we went out was 8 years ago in highschool. The reason we broke up was my fault:


About a year in I met a guy, Arthur, who soon became my friend. There was nothing more than a platonic interest but my boyfriend was convinced me and arthur were flirting and made me stop talking to him which I told him I would. If I saw arthur after making this agreement and talked to him, I lied about it to my bf. he found out and we broke up, but stayed good friends.


After we broke up, Arthur and I remained friends. There has never been any further interest and never will be. He's another girl in my eyes and he considers me a little sister. I can confidently say that no lines will ever be crossed.


Fast forward to a few months ago (8 years after first break up). Dave and I reconnect through a mutual friend and sparks fly and we start seeing each other again. This time I made it clear that I was still friends with Arthur and that Dave needed to accept that if we were to pursue anything. Dave said that he'd let me be Arthur's friend, but I wasn't allowed to talk about him in Arthur's presence.


Now here's the issue:

A couple of nights ago I made plans with Arthur for the morning and Dave for the same night. Dave knew thaws plans and I thought he was okay with it. Unfortunately Arthur couldn't make it and Dave had something come up so I told him is stay home. Around 8 Arthur let me know he was available to go out right that second so I told Dave what was happening. I told him id be home at 930 and that id call him when I was back. I ended up being an hour late but wasn't able to let Dave know because my phone died. Dave exploded. He was upset that I was out late because I don't hang out with him past 900ish. 


I see Dave almost everyday, and I wake up at 5 for work, so I don't stay out with him if I can avoid it. I make exceptions for others because I don't see them as much - this was only the second time I saw Arthur in a year. I explained this to him and he wouldn't listen. He kept calling me a liar for being late after telling him id be home at a certain time. He said a lot of means things and I was pretty upset.

 He called back later that night and said look, let's pretend it's 930 and move on. I stated telling him about my night. I mentioned telling Arthur about how much I cared about Dave and he exploded again. He said that the only thing he asked me was to not talk about him. He kept telling me that Arthur was evil and would use that to hurt him. As he kept calling me a liar and then broke up with me. I've had time to process it and I think it's for the best, but I don't think I did anything wrong. Was O wrong? Any and all reasoning would be appreciated.

21896,Breakups,1om348,"For the past year or so, one of my good friends (22M) and I have been getting a lot closer. At the start of the summer, he and I started dating and everything was going really well. We had the same relaxed attitude, similar interests, focus on fun, and it finally seemed like this was going to be a relationship that was worthwhile. I'm young, dated casually, never really put much effort into dating and just let it happen, so when this guy and I got together it was the first time I felt seriously about someone.

Summer is going by well, we're getting closer, enjoying ourselves. Things start going south in his life, unrelated to us. Basically his funding got cut for school, his job fell through, and where we live isn't exactly a prosperous area. In the same week, other friends of mine and his who had been planning all summer to move across the country have a situation fall through and they're looking for another roommate. Problem, meet solution. So obviously my boyfriend (who is the adventure type) takes up the opportunity, and decides to move north with the others. I honestly can't say I blame him for going, I would do the same in his position. We were only together a few months, so naturally we broke up when he left and we're trying to stay friends, but it is tough.

Meanwhile, an ex-boyfriend (term used loosely) from high school recently started chatting me up and I can't help myself but enjoy the attention. I feel bad because my ex, who I was / am really into but can't reasonably see myself with any time soon, only left a couple weeks ago and I know I'm just rebounding. But at the same time, this blast from the past makes me laugh, it's a great distraction, and normally I don't really see the harm in a little flirting.

21900,Breakups,1x0qqf,"I posted this thread earlier, instead of actually getting any sort of advice people just called me an asshole, wish my wife took me to the cleaners on a divorce, called me a loser etc. I am posting this a second time, if you don't want to offer any advice please don't bother commenting. Thank you. 

I’ll give some background. I am a 47 year old guy married to my wife for 24 years to my wife who is 46. We are a childfree couple and intend to stay that way. My wife and I are both attractive people, both fit, work good jobs, and have an upper middle class lifestyle. We have on overall pretty happy marriage, my wife and I have been through a lot.

Now the problem or so is, that I have over the years wanted to sleep with other women. I have been 100% faithful in our marriage and I would never betray my wife’s trust. I proposed an open marriage so we can both seek relationships outside of our marriage, and live a more fulfilling life. When I was younger I never had a fun/party type lifestyle, and well I want to explore it now when I am successful.

The problem is my wife is completely against the entire thing. When I proposed the idea to her she freaked out and started crying. After she calmed down she told me that porn was ruining my mind and she wanted me to stop watching it. I decided I’d give it a shot and my desires have only gotten more intense, where I lust after other women harder. My wife became more sexually aggressive after the talks, however I don’t really want more sex with her. Our sex life has always been pretty good, however I want to have sex with other women, after being with the same woman for 27 years (dated for 3 years before we got married) it gets boring.

I have tried bringing it up with my wife and she just starts crying saying I am going to leave her if we open up the marriage. I have assured her I won’t but she says that I can’t be sure. It is truly getting to the point where I am considering just going for a divorce. Should I give her the ultimatum that if we don’t have an open relationship than we go for a divorce? I don’t think having her accept under those circumstances would even be good since I got it out of her through intimidation. If an open relationship is what I want and my wife turns me down, is it my job to end our marriage?

**Little backstory:** 

It's been around 2 months since the breakup. We were each others first serious relationship, and lost our first kisses and virginity to each other. We dated for a little over 4 months, and I would say that we were in love at one point. He eventually broke up with me, saying that he fell out of love. At the same time, during the end of our relationship, he'd already been flirting with other girls. He said he was trying to get me to break up with him first. I was really emotionally hurt a lot of the time while we dated, but I told myself it was worth it because of how much I liked him. Now, we still occaisionally message each other.

His birthday is coming up and there was a gift that I'd really love to present him with, because I'm sure he'd like it (BMF wallet from Pulp Fiction). I don't know how I feel about him anymore, because I've come to realize that there are things about him that I dislike and that I didn't realize until awhile after splitting up. However, there is still a part of me that still finds him attractive and doesn't want to lose him. 

I'd like to tell myself that it's just a friendly gesture, but how do you think he would react if I got him a birthday present? I want to but at the same time I don't. Please help :(

21918,Dating,1j9om3,"Hi Reddit,

Il try and keep this short and concise. I am currently dating a girl who I met in a bar around a month ago, with things only getting increasingly serious in the last week or so. Since meeting her however I have 'been back to hers (and mine)' 4/5 times after both being out in my local town. The first night I actually met her, I didn't even say a word to her all night, and was set up my a mate who heard her over-say 'I was hoping to get lucky tonight'. So on my first night of meeting her I slept with her...ok, cool. Doesn't have to get serious. But of course poses doubts over any trust I could have for her.

Secondly, since getting to know her I am aware she regularly goes out every week partaking a number of consumables aka. E, LSD &amp; Weed. Now, I didn't judge. If she wants to do this kind of thing, who am I to change someone? But as I am not experienced in the world of Ecstasy/LSD, can I trust someone who is off their face at least once a week? I have trust issues as it is, and I'm struggling to come to terms on whether or not I could deal with this. 

So should I confront her about these kind of things sooner rather than later? It's hard to discuss these issues, without me making it sound like I think she's a slut or that I have trust issues. I've already told her that I won't try to change her, but simply ask for honesty and faithfulness. She has told me she really likes me, and admits she used to see guys as a 'use and throw away', so clearly I've sparked something different...but am I just getting myself into a situation where the chances are I'm gonna be lied to/messed around?

We decided to keep the relationship even with the long distance and I like to think for the most part it was a great achievement that we managed to do it. We obviously had our shares of disagreements and some nasty fights. Even though I managed to have her visit me things our relationship became pretty rough as she expected me to not go out with the friends I made and to travel alone rather than with the other Brazilians from my uni.

21924,Breakups,2hr5br,"I am not very good at getting emotions out on paper (text), so please forgive me. 

It all started 4 lonnnngggg years ago. I was a freshman in college when i met my gf of 4 years on and off. It was amazing at first she was sweet, innocent, and i felt i could trust her. I was wrong. 

I have to add at this time in college I had significantly changed up my life style. I got real fit, after being heavy all through high school. I was social, with many many friends. However, this meant nothing to me. Being heavy during school all i ever wanted was a gf, but not any gf.. I wanted someone beautiful. I know this sound shallow, but after repetitive years of just feeling alone being picked on, insulted, and just beat down (emotionally not physically I was a 6'5'' lineman) i just wanted someone i could show off. 

So, back to the story.. It was freshman year of college, and my good life took a turn for the worse. I sustained a significant injury to my knee that ended my sports career, and my active life style (at least for 4 years of recovery). 

About this time i was feeling pretty down on myself when i ended up meeting my ex. I knew her already through an old friend ( they dated which i thought was no big deal but i ended up losing tons of my friends). We hit it off great. She was sweet, caring, and just adorable to be with. She was gorgeous, but not in a sorority girl fantasy kind of way... but she was just stunning to me. 

So fast forward to my first surgery. At this time she was just ending high school ( we should have been in the same grade but i made the cut off by a day). Things were still great she would come over every day and just be with me. 

Fast forward to her first semester in college. At this point its been about 8 months into the relationship. It has been good still, however me still being bed ridden after an unexpected second surgery has put me on edge. I start being mean and grumpy, but try to control it. She starts up college and basketball at the same college as me. She starts becoming more and more busy having no time to hang. I try to be supportive, but at the same time I was still mean at points. 

Eventually, we break up for the first time. She ended up starting to date the basketball star for the guys team. I was devastated and I tried reasoning with her to talk, but it didnt work.. at first. After about a month of dating this new fling she ended no contact and asked me what the name of the hair place was I go to...... yeah, subtle. Well from there we started talking and hanging out and she eventually cheated on her bf with me. It was another two months and christmas comes around, and she is still with him. She said she couldn't do it yet, because of her parents. Her mom is pretty nuts... she has issues with the way her daughters look, act, and date. If your not the best she doesn't like you.

So eventually i took matters into my hands and sent the kid emails we had talking about her and I. He ended up breaking up with her.At this point I should have said forget it, but years of torment in High School I have developed such little respect for myself and unhealthy attachment that the emotional roller coaster had me stuck already. 

Over the next 4 years we broke up MANY MANY times. Trust was lost as she was talking to her original ex bf for half the relationship as Sam in her phone. It between a few days of break up she kissed 5 guys over the years and slept with her  ex (she lost her virginity to me). I was not fault free. The low self worth i felt was back as i put weight back on, and was amplified by the lost of trust. I still couldn't leave.. The high was intoxicating. We would get back together every few weeks, and it was just amazing for a month or so, then back to fighting.

It didn't help we were in every class together, being the same major and a small college. I don't know if she just kept coming back because I helped her in her classes or she really wanted to try. I know i was wrong i was insulting and i was mean at points, but i couldn't hold my tongue. I would make comments about guys she was talking to and petty stuff about friends. I lost all off my friends because of her. She didnt trust me going out with anyone. 

Graduation happened this past may and we broke up right before it. We kept contact every few weeks as usual, like a clock she was talking to guys (she has this needed to always be talking to someone).I had dated someone for a month trying to get over her, but i could not stop comparing this girl to her. About 3 weeks ago i moved to oklahoma by myself, and we start talking the week before i leave. We facetime all week she assures me that her and this guy she kissed were just friends, and that she just wanted to talk to me and see what happens. We talk monday-friday, when saturday comes around no contact is made anymore. I tried two texts then stop. Its been two weeks since then. 

I have had my total self worth taked away from me. She is still a beautiful girl getting tons of attention, while im in a new state all by myself. I am lonely know no one, and just miss her. I know i was not a good boyfriend, and i definitely played a part in the fighting but i just couldnt stop. 

I don't know if any of this makes sense at all when read. I just had to type this out and post it somewhere. I have spent the last 2 weeks getting back into a lifting routine, cardio, and trying to get out and meet people. I just am not anyones number one choice right now. I don't think i am bad looking or anything, but im not grade A. For the life of me I can not stop comparing everyone to her.

I am stuck I hate myself. I miss my ex probably for all the wrong reasons. I feel lost and alone in a knew place. I want to just text her to see how she's doing, but i know it wouldn't work. Everything I do i think of her. I am lifting, running, and eating healthy because when i visit home  ( she lives 3 miles form me) I hope she sees what i look like.

Sorry that this is poorly written. I just needed to save this. I just want  to break this unhealthy attachment. I feel I had a lot of fault in the relationship, and there is a lot more that happened (crazy mom always talking bad, about me and calling me to leave her daughter alone while she was trying to talk to me). I would start fights all the time because of the loss of trust. I think I really fucked up.

We had so much in common including music (house/reggae) and went to a festival together, we love world food, we were both equally passionate about our course (medicine), going to museums and watching documentaries, we had a lot of the same friends, interests including hockey and had lots of fun together. We also spent a weekend in dublin and a month living in London together, where I met his family, and we explored the city and took loads of photos and argued only once or twice. I also accepted him in every way, and with every flaw, including his weed and MDMA habit. He used to tell me loads of times about how he appreciated all the little special things about me and that I was different from other girls. I also helped him LOADS with sub-letting his flat and a magazine he is in charge of - though at one point he told me that i 'don't care about or help with anything' only to regret it the next day to see i had organised his sub-letting emails so he could deal with them better. All of his fb profile and cover photos over the past year have been taken by me as well, and they have a million likes each, how can he forget me so fast?


We were gearing up to go back to medical school together and i spoke a lot about how we would see each other only a few times a week, to study and see friends the rest of the time, and he was delighted that i was going to take him away mountain biking (his favourite) for his birthday treat. We also spoke about how this year things would be different with his friends and people we're around.


He then broke up with me over the phone suddenly, saying he can't do it anymore and doesn't love me anymore and hasn't done for months. I have since told him where i think things went wrong - having enough of our own space, and me chilling out more mainly - and accepted that we need space atm. I have also deleted him off Facebook because I just hurt so much and have been trying NC, although really difficult. I also spoke to and apologised to some of his friends for things i said throughout the year and for not giving them all enough space. To which they all responded positively and said our break up is a shame.

21939,Breakups,3ddqz3,"Tomorrow would have marked our six month, but the other day we had a breakup. It seems rather silly because her and I truly cared for one another and neither wanted to break up.

Our relationship was great, we always got to hang out and be weird around one another; however, after two weeks of summer vacation she got a job that required her to work from 6am- about 4pm. 

What this entitled was that we could not text or call like we used to. After work each day she kept feeling tired and felt bad for not being able to talk to me all day. Our conversations turned short and unhappiness ensued. 

We had met in person to discuss our relationship on the weekend, and at this point we both agreed our feelings never changed, and we cared immensely about each other, but she felt she needed time for herself which I respect fully. 

In one month's time, she will not have to work anymore and I talked about this with her, but we still broke up regardless. 

There is nothing I would like more than to be together with her again, after all, why should we just throw our happy relationship away? 

All in all, I'm torn between letting go and moving on, or seriously considering getting back together once her job is over. All advice would be appreciated!

   
**tl;dr**: Girlfriend and I broke up because she needed time for herself. Am considering getting together in the future.","Me [16 M] with my breakup with[16 F] after 6 months, questioning getting back together",0.0,False,2.0,2.0,1436968662.0,/r/relationships/comments/3ddqz3/me_16_m_with_my_breakup_with16_f_after_6_months/,Romantic
21943,Breakups,32f98v,"Hey guys, so I was with this girl for about two years. Back in December 2014, I broke up with her because I no longer felt the same about her as I used to and I didn't want to lead her on if I wasn't going to reciprocate the love that she deserves. She was absolutely devasted, and I had no idea why I lost touch with my feelings towards her. I hated myself for it because she was so caring and compassionate with an unconditional kind of love that I feel like I'll never be able to receive again. 

Fast forward to February 2015, I thought that I wanted her back. I gave up so easily, and I didn't want to let go of this relationship. I saw a future with her, and I decided that I didn't want to let the one girl get away, so to speak. She took me back after thinking it over for a few weeks, which was understandable; she wanted me to show her first that I was serious about getting back together, and that I'd try to make this work. 

After a good month of trying to rekindle our relationship, I slowly started to develop the same feelings that led to the first breakup; I just kind of felt numb. I broke up with her yesterday, and it hurt even worse the second time around. She didn't understand why I kept playing with her feelings, and she was even angrier that I can't give her a reason for why I feel the way that I do.

I know that what I did was incredibly selfish. I neglected her and broke it off with her without giving her a clear explanation why. I've had some serious emotional issues in the past, with other girls, so I thought maybe I was just scared of commitment. I absolutely love her, and I always will. I told her that I needed to figure out what I wanted and that I want to approach her one day as a better man, with a better heart. 

Like I mentioned earlier, she supported me and loved me in a way that any man would want, and I have no idea why I threw it away. I am just absolutely terrified that maybe I have just lost the one. I no longer want to lead her on, and I will not be asking for her back until I have matured. I know that I'm an asshole for doing what I did, and it sounds even worse that I feel sad for breaking up with a girl who loves me. I don't know what finding out what I want implies, but I'm hoping that one day I come to that realization, and maybe go back to her, if fate permits. 

I know I should grow up to be a better person, and not grow up just to be with her again. I would like to be back together with her, one day in the future, if that's who I'm supposed to be with. Is this even normal? Am I just exaggerating? I have no idea if she really is the one, but I'm scared that she is.

   
**tl;dr**: I broke up with my girlfriend of two years, and I think that I want to come back to her one day as a better man because I feel like she is the one.

**Update**: I'm not entirely sure if I should have put Update or Edit because I don't often post on reddit. For a little clarification, we're both seniors in undergrad. Anyways, after reading through these comments, I've really come to terms with my selfishness in the duration of my FU. I've also come to accept that I should just leave her alone and let her go, so that I could let her try to live her life in peace, which I completely agree with. Thanks for all the honest input, it was really appreciated.

21944,Infidelity,3ifc5p,"I know the title sounds like not such a big deal. But my best friend (23F) has been married since she was 18. And is currently still with her husband (23M). Background:

I've been friends with this girl for the last decade. Really close group of friends in high school, and since we've all graduated and started our lives a few of us have kept in touch. Especially us two. She's been with this same guy since we graduated, they even got married two years into their relationship and have sort of become the de facto mom and dad of our friends. She stayed in our hometown and went to school, became a hairdresser. He also went thru college and graduated. I joined the Marines. 

Two years ago we became close again as I started dating one of her friends. Things got serious between us but we broke up a few months ago, while I was away with the Marines. So as I came back last weekend and dealt with adjusting to civilian life, I'm concurrently having to relive old memories of my most recent ex. I bought her a ring and was ready to propose to her. This makes things tough being in my hometown. So I decided to do something that I love doing and I'm going to use my GI Bill to go to a music school in LA. This moving to LA becomes important later. 

When I first got home I thought about not even hanging out with my best friend (23f), who we'll call Selena from this point. Reason being is she's still friends with my ex and I'm trying to avoid my ex like the plague. Eventually after hanging out with a few of my friends it felt wrong to not hit Selena up. So I text both her and her husband (23m), who we'll call Jason. Jason and I text for a short duration, didn't really make plans to chill. Selena though made it obvious she wanted to hang out immediately, like any close friend you haven't seen in months would do. But her messages were using a lot of I and me, not us like she would usually use. So at this point I remember my ex telling me four or five months ago that Selena and Jason were on the rocks, like bad. Pretty much divorce incoming because Jason wouldn't change and Selena wanted more out of life than just staying in our hometown and having babies. 

The thought only crossed my mind that they might have split, I wasn't 100% and didn't wanna ask over a text. So we left our conversation with her saying she'd hit me up after dinner. A few hours go by. She tells me they're done with dinner and I can come thru. I show up and of course she's there with Jason. They seem happy. We go out for drinks and meet up with a bunch of our other friends whom I still hadn't seen since I came back to town. At some point Selena tells me she needs to talk to me about something later. No big deal, I just assumed it was something about my ex. A few hours at the bar and we decide to take the party back to their house. 

There were about 7 of us just playing some drinking games, super late at night already drunk. Nothing wild. Well I sat down on a two seater couch. And Selena sat next to me as we were playing our last few games. She started getting really comfortable with me. Like resting her legs on top of mine and such. Meanwhile I'm looking at Jason like hey, this is normal right? But it ends there.

Jason says he's going to sleep. He had work in the morning. And two of our friends as well. Now it's just Selena and I, and two of our other friends. We decide just us four will continue playing our favorite game of the night. But first our two friends want a cigarette break. I don't smoke, and neither does she. So we stay on our couch super close to one another. This is when she tells me what she wanted to tell me earlier at the bar: that her and Jason are seriously about to split up, she asks me if she can go to LA with me. She had been bringing up how her and Jason should go to LA the whole night, and of course with me moving there soon I kept trying to convince Jason with her. Her argument with him was that they need to go to a city where she can make money doing what she wants to do: hairdressing. Instead of what she's doing now: waitress. And Jason kept ignoring us basically. 

At this point I'm like fuck. I feel bad for her. They've been together since they were like 18, and just now they're finding that they can't get past this one thing. They're just young and they've grown to be different people. It happens. I tell her it's okay. I would let her move in with me in LA no matter my living arrangement, she means that much to me. She tells me in the next three or four weeks she's going with or without him. It's up to him. And they actually had this conversation on Sunday, but he convinced her to just give him time to decide. 

Our other two friends come back in from their smoke break. We play two more games and she has become increasingly comfortable sitting next to me. Like she's leaning into me as we sit there. She's got her arms resting on my legs. I could see my other friends looks of confusion, they knew something was up. At one point she has her hands clutching my thigh and I realize this is intentional. She wants me. It was kinda weird but I did not want to stop it. 

Our two friends said they're ready to leave and take off. I move to the other couch. She joins me. And immediately goes back to talking about how Jason won't change. There's no way he'll go to LA with her. But she shouldn't have to hang up her dreams or happiness because of him. She's too young. At some point in her spiel she grabbed my hand. So now we're holding hands while she's talking about how she's gonna leave her husband. Even in this moment I could see what was coming but I didn't care. I wanted her too. I told her no matter what, I've always got you 

And like that we were making out. Sparks flying, butterflies, all that stuff. I couldn't believe it. And then I couldn't fucking believe myself. I stopped. 

She started to tear up. Rinse. Repeat. She went into her speech again, I dried her tears, we made out again. We stopped quickly again. 

She cried again and at this point I asked if I should leave. But she wouldn't let me. I held her all night while she went in between crying and talking to me about all that had just happened. She was so broken. I couldn't believe how quickly it had just happened. In the fallout of those conversations some things we covered were: how her marriage was over, how over it would be if she told Jason we'd kissed, how she wasn't ready to lose Jason, how she can't continue to live with Jason anyway, how this was a mistake, how she would be all over me if she wasn't married, how she was extremely horny but Jason didn't deserve that, how she didn't want me to think just because she's married to Jason that he's her number one option, how she doesn't want me to feel like her second option, how she can't move to LA now because she's not ready to leave Jason, how we should probably tell him, how we probably couldn't tell him. At one point when there was a lull she just straight up said she loved me. And I said it back. 

I went thru a whole range of emotions in those couple hours I spent holding her as tight as I could. First I felt shitty. I literally just wrecked their marriage. But I realized I still wanted her. Holding her felt more right than anything I've felt before. Maybe I couldn't control my feelings. But she was basically telling me she wanted to runaway to LA with me. Looking back it all looks so stupid. She's married. But I fucked up too. So basically reddit, this all happened last night. I've spent all day sleeping and trying to forget it happened. Which we both agreed we would do, and not tell Jason. But I don't know what to do now. I feel like I can't just not tell Jason, and I know she feels the same. And even worse, I definitely have feelings for her. I know she meant it when she said she loved me, and I meant it when I said it back. I don't want her to stay here and not live a happy life. But I'm not gonna tell her how to live her life, I'm not gonna tell her to leave her husband for me. 

I leave for LA in two weeks. What the fuck do I do?

The issue is that I think she may have kissed someone at a festival she went to last night. I trust her entirely when shes sober, but she's very new to drinking and she comes across as naive when shes drunk, so I was sort of worried something like this might happen. 


I'm wondering if this is enough to show the relationship is going nowhere, or if it still has potential. I know it's only two months, but it's going great and it felt like it could be a really long-term thing, so I don't want to throw it away without properly considering it first.


On a side note, I'm not entirely sure if she did kiss someone, and I haven't got a chance to speak to her sober yet, but I received a text from her saying I fucked up so massively, then when I asked how about an hour later she responded talking about how she'd just been hit with something and she was trying to change the subject, it just came across as very non-genuine. This is kinda irrelevant to the question but if you have any insight into whether that probably means she did cheat it would be appreciated.

21970,Breakups,2p1i8m,"So last week my girlfriend of almost a year broke up with me over text. All she would really say in the text as to why is because it hasnt felt right the past few days. I told her I wanted to talk about it person.

I called her the next day to make sure she was going to be ok with talking about it.  And she was. A few days later she texts saying Hope youre doing okay, to which i relplied not until we have talked. 

The next day at work she texted me asking me if i was there etc, then saying if i wanted to go on a smoke break to let her know. The next few days she keeps trying to text me like nothing ever happened. It was really fucking with me so I told her that her texting me like nothing happened is really fucking with my emotions and that we really need to talk because I wanted to try to fix things etf etc. 

So Tuesday we talked in person about what happened. Basically all I got from her was I mixed up my feelings of wanting to be friends with something romantic. After which I said I'm going need some space before I can be just friends because she really meant a lot to me.

My confusion stems from the fact that after reiterating multiple times that I will need a good bit of time and space to get over this before I can just be friends, she still is trying to text me and talk to me a lot at work like nothing ever happened. I dont know what to do because her mom has major issues and she gets (ex) super depressed around this time of the year. She also hadnt seemed like herself the a bit before the breakup but she didnt seem like breakyupy (if that even makes sense). Plus we had hung out for a bit 3 days before she ended it and everything felt fine and we even made out a bit before I left.

21971,Breakups,1neccy,"I met Louise last September at a social group when I was trying to make new friends after moving to a new city. We hit it off immediately. She had broken up with her girlfriend (Sam) of 5 years one month previously after discovering Sam had been cheating on her for three months with a guy. Naturally, she was devastated and pretty low, though she hid it well. 

We became closer and ended up confiding a lot in one another. I admitted to her I had suffered depression and anorexia some years previously and she admitted to me that she had started self-harming when she first came out to her parents and they were less than supportive. Sam initially supported Louise through this but ultimately claimed that Louise’s problems had caused her (Sam) to become depressed and that is why she cheated on her.

Back to us; Louise and I became closer and although I had no romantic intentions initially, I realised I had begun to develop feelings. I kept it to myself until one drunken night last December when we kissed. It was lovely and I asked if we could begin seeing each other, but completely understood when she said she wasn’t over her ex. We continued as friends but ended up kissing on another drunken night a month later. She came home with me and we slept together. We realised we had deep feelings for one another. We went back and forth on whether to get involved romantically, she was obviously still not over Sam and we knew it wasn’t the sensible thing to do but we couldn’t stay away from one another. She told me I’d shown her how to be happy again, for the first time in years and I was completely smitten.

We progressed slowly, I didn’t want to rush her in any way, we just enjoyed our time together. It was fun, tender, beautiful and we were so happy. She lives about an hour away, so we mostly only got to see one another at weekends and sometimes for a night during the week, but in between we constantly texted and would chat for hours on facebook.

Unfortunately, around the same time, Sam decided she wanted Louise back. They had continued to stay in contact and meet up every week or so. Sam was obviously upset that Louise was seeing me and continually asked her to stop seeing me. I wasn’t best pleased about this, but I knew the history they had, I understood and also felt bad for Sam considering her depression. Louise was very worried about Sam and told me Sam had no one else she could turn to for support, so at times I even encouraged Louise to spend time with her, though I was sceptical that there was no one else she could turn to – I think Louise was the last person she should be turning to under the circumstances, especially as Louise was still so hurt by Sam’s betrayal and by losing the future they had planned together. 

Feelings between us deepened, we were in love. She was very aware of the difficult situation and my feelings and the last thing she wanted to do was hurt me. When things were difficult we would talk openly and she was always totally honest and encouraged me to open up to her.

I continued trying to be understanding about the situation with Sam, but things started to hurt. She still loved Sam, though had no attraction or romantic feelings for her. There were numerous occasions where Louise would cancel plans with me to go spend time with Sam and I didn’t feel I could argue because Sam needed support. She stayed over at Sam’s regularly, though always in the spare room and I completely trust that there were no shenanigans. 

I integrated Louise into my life, she met my family, but she never introduced me to any of her friends. She did introduce me to her family once, though only as a “friend”, which I appreciate was a huge deal for her considering the problems she had with them, but apart from this nobody in her life really knew I even existed. On top of this, Sam constantly posted pictures on Louise’s facebook wall of them when they had been a couple and their friends would comment how cute they looked together. She filled up Louise’s wall with little in-jokes and they would comment back and forth about things they had experienced together. I always felt posting things there was off-limits to me, in case it upset Sam. I know FB shouldn’t be important, but if you looked at her page, it looked as though they were still together and I didn’t exist. I wasn’t comfortable with this very public back and forth between them and told Louise but nothing changed.

Sam’s depression seemed to worsen. At one point she told Louise she would kill herself if Louise didn’t take her back. She obviously didn’t follow through on this threat, but it hit Louise hard. She felt responsible for Sam’s situation and guilty for being with me. Every time they saw one another, Sam would try to convince Louise to leave me and go back to her. Louise was very honest with me about this, but I was upset that Louise didn’t just shut it down and tell Sam it wasn’t going to happen.

Louise didn’t want us to use the label “girlfriend” as she wasn’t ready (and it would hurt Sam), which was fine to begin with, but it really started to make me feel inadequate after a while. We discussed this recently and I admitted I couldn’t continue indefinitely the way we were and that I felt like I only had half of her and half of her was still with Sam. I told her I wanted to be her number one person, her priority, as she was mine, but this really upset her. She said she couldn’t imagine Sam not being the top of her list. Ouch. I started to become very jealous and insecure, I felt pathetic, I’d never experienced this in a relationship before.

Louise was naturally under stress with our relationship and the Sam situation. She felt torn, not wanting to hurt either one of us. She was due to start an intense Uni programme beginning September and the week beforehand, she cut herself for the first time since her break up with Sam. I was upset that she was hurting so badly to do this and resolved to do everything in my power to help her. I researched, I sought advice and talked through it with her, I wanted to be there for her. 

Unfortunately, a week later I messed up. Something had set off my insecurities and when I tried to talk to Louise about it she got really upset, said she didn’t want to be a dick but that she couldn’t deal with it at that moment, with the way she was feeling. She said she need a break from me, from Sam, from everything, to just concentrate on her course for a couple of weeks. I was devastated, but agreed, if it was the best thing I could do for her.

The following weekend I went to visit friends in another city to take my mind off it. I wasn’t coping well. I wanted to give her the space she needed, but I knew that her needing space at all was surely a bad sign, surely as her partner I should be a sort of refuge? Seeing me should be a stress reliever and I felt awful at the thought I was contributing to her stress.

I returned and we got together the following weekend after 2 weeks of mostly no contact. We had a lovely weekend, I kept my worries to myself and concentrated on supporting her, but she let slip that the previous weekend, while I was away and she was supposed to be having a break from everything, she had spent time with Sam. I was gutted, but she became defensive. She said she needed Sam, that Sam makes her feel calm. I didn’t push it any further. As much as I wanted to be the one she turned to, I knew she was feeling fragile and it was more important that she did whatever she needed to keep from cutting than avoiding Sam just for my sake.

She was supposed to come visit the following Friday, but on Thursday when I asked what time she was planning to come over, she said that she was supposed to see Sam during the week and hadn’t had chance, so she was going to go stay over there on Friday and come see me Saturday instead. I didn’t want to rock the boat and said that was fine. We had a lovely day on Saturday, but I was feeling hurt and side-lined. Knowing she was feeling vulnerable, I tried to keep this to myself, but on Sunday morning, somehow it all came out. I love her and don’t doubt that she loved me too, but I constantly felt like I was second best. I wanted us to share our lives, but felt invisible in hers. I broke things off and asked for no contact. She was heartbroken, I feel horrendous doing this to her when she’s already so vulnerable and it’s killing me wondering how she’s doing.

This was one week ago. I’m crushed. I’ve had break ups before, I know I will get over this eventually and she will too, but I can’t help feeling I could have done more, could have supported her better or been stronger or more patient. I keep hoping she will come around and come back to me. This is only the second time in my life I’ve fallen in love. Aside from the Sam issues, things were wonderful. I saw a future with her in it, I imagined us growing old together. I can’t shake those feelings and I know that finding someone like that doesn’t happen every day. I’m scared that I’ve ruined things with the girl I was meant to be with. 

I’m ashamed to admit this, but I’ve developed an irrational hatred of Sam and keep fantasising about horrible things happening to her. I actually fully hate the woman. I think she manipulated Louise throughout our relationship (and before). I know a lot of the crappy things she put Louise through during their relationship and after, including physical violence. It hurts so much knowing I gave Louise everything I had and she still values this manipulative abuser above me. I know she can’t help the way she feels, but it makes me feel worthless. I’m also a real peace-lover so feeling so hateful towards someone I’ve never even met also makes me feel bad.

I guess I need to know if I did the right thing. It’s hard to see it when you’re in it and in love, so please give it to me straight. Should I have kept my feelings to myself and stuck it out? Is it ok for me to hope we can be together in the future if she resolves her issues? Or have I made things worse for her and is she better off without me? Should I stop being hopeful and try to move on? 

Thanks so much if you’ve taken the time to read this.

General background information: 
We're both seniors in high school- let's call him Matt. We've been acquainted since junior year and actually became friends/talked more this fall. Matt dated my friend Tracy for the latter quarter of junior year. 

Tracy's background information: 
Tracy has some self-diagnosed mental health issues and has gone to therapy before. This will be relevant soon. Additionally, it should be said that Tracy has disapproved of my friendship with Matt that developed this fall, as she dated him in the past. That caused a rift, but I came to the conclusion that I should have the freedom to form friendships and even relationships without the need to garner her approval. It should be noted that Tracy has the tendency to be manipulative and lie. 
Tracy dated one of my best friends, Trevor, throughout sophomore and part of junior year. I've heard from both Tracy and Trevor that the relationship was toxic. 

Matt and my background information:
Around September and through October we became friends and started talking more frequently. I could see something more than a friendship develop in the future. I have no idea how to word this without sounding kinda insane, but I went through Tracy's blog at the time frame where she was involved with Matt. She often posts about significant others and such, and through my so-called research I came across Matt's blog. I was floored. On his blog there were a couple incredibly graphic porn gifs. I believe I'm pretty vanilla for a teenager these days, and I don't watch porn or sext at all, so these images were.. really, really disturbing. I mean, it looked like the literal dictionary definition of rape against a woman. Despite being inexperienced with sexual acts at my age, I understand the definition/general outline of BDSM but how does one know that the individuals in those gifs, when filmed, consented to what they were doing? It seems like a VERY risky thing to be viewing- there are way too many what ifs involved. Furthermore, by blogging it, does that not display what Matt could be into? His tendencies? 

Back to Tracy:
Remember how I said my best guy friend, Trevor, was involved with Tracy? Trevor has told me a great deal about his time with Tracy, and how she was very experienced sexually (he wasn't, and this was his first relationship). Trevor has stated how Tracy led him into certain things that he wasn't 100% comfortable with, such as sexting. Presently, he's shooting himself in the foot for not understanding how he was cajoled, by Tracy, into stuff (primarily of a sexual nature). I told Trevor, who I fully trust, about Matt's blog (that no one else knows about). Trevor isn't super close friends with Matt, so I don't think he's saving face, but Trevor believes it's a possibility that Tracy manipulated Matt into blogging those certain gifs. For example, Matt only blogged those certain images during the thick of his relationship with Tracy; only Tracy knew about his blog, and so on. There's more to this but I'm trying to keep up a little privacy, just in case. 

Back to Matt and me: 
I've made sure to study Matt and his behavior, especially if a more than friends relationship is on the horizon. NOTHING in his actions or conversations through text is a red flag. There has been no talk about anything related to sex, no mention of hooking up, nothing. We've held hands a few times (at the movie theater with our group of friends) and he wasn't forceful or crude at all. He is well-mannered and polite to me. As of now, we've settled on being friends but he mentioned the possibility of a more than friends relationship in the future. This came up because last week he told me he was planning to ask me out- I said I don't have the time/energy to maintain a romantic relationship at this point in time. That is not a lie, but I'm also trying to buy myself a little time. 

Final question:
Should I bring up his blog to him? I have a strong feeling there's more to the story than what I came across, but I don't want to outright address it for the following reasons: a) It'll bring back his relationship with Tracy, which ended poorly and generally has a negative connotation; b) We're graduating next spring, so it's doubtful anything serious will develop and actually last; c) By addressing it with him I could learn who his true self is, and that would be saddening to me (this is a selfish reason, but honest). On a more positive note, though, I could bring this up with him and discover he was being heavily influenced or even forced by Tracy to involve himself with it. As far-fetched as this may sound to an outsider I wouldn't be surprised at that. Tracy is unstable. If that's true, I would feel much, much more comfortable continuing my friendship with Matt

We've been on like 7 dates or so dont remember, talked about exclusivity but no label yet because she is someone that is very loyal, but has been cheated on so many times, and likes to go slow and basically for one reason or another we haven't even seen each other in 3 weeks now. FWIW with the slowness, we did have sex but then she was like wait i want to go slower than that so we havent lately.


The thing is there have been real reasons, but its hard to not get frustrated and selfish. Her mom got ill for example and thats awful and you try to be supportive, but then some days its clear you COULD figure out a way to hang out but shes just not that invested to include me and it sucks.

I asked her twice on days she was working til 8pm, once she could have but had a beach day with her female friend.. Then she asked me to hang out once and I was busy with my final for school, and then I had asked yesterday about today/tomorrow and she said probably. Now it turns out she can't today, didn't ask her why, and tomorrow she can't because her sick mom is coming. 


So this weekend passing will be 3 weeks since I've seen her. For example inviting me to a party with her roommates here and there instead of just texting me about it and during it, or that beach, whatever. At least once. Obviously not EVERY time, but at least once so we do hang out at least once a week is what I need.


So obviously I want to be supportive about the mom coming over though, but then I log on and can see this:


Going to a concert by myself, first time I've ever gone without my concert buddies :(


And it frustrates me. Is that wrong? She will routinely say things like when you come over we'll watch x, and indicate that she plans on seeing me again, but ts really hard to be patient with someone and be loyal to them which I want to be but they don't see you on days they clearly can.
Should I be understanding and like well, maybe she doesnt want to be at a concert with me and thats OK, or is it a nail in the coffin, or can I go ahead and be like so I saw youre going to a concert is that a thing you wanna do by yourself or you wanna hang out that day with me and then go to it with me? i mean thats kinda weird to invite yourself to something though. Ive never done anything like that.


We consistently talk but it seems like its hard to keep this going even if there is anything to keep going at this point. Thank you for any advice. I'm just confused and she doesnt seem all that interested but then again the circumstances have been weird and she shows interest in some ways. Ugh. Maybe I'll just ask her out again on monday and see what happens, I dont fucking know.

One instinct says something is wrong, how can you have sex and go on dates and talk about long term and be told you're missed and then not see her for 3 weeks? Shes obviously over it, youre being dumb ,move on. 

The other instinct says DUDE, SLOW THE FUCK DOWN, ITS 7 DATES and she texts you and says she likes you, yes shes busy and has other important things and needs space and shit, but that doesnt mean another guy is there and you can still possibly have this end up well. PATIENCE AND JUST KEEP TRYING. But I don't know who to listen to anymore.

A week or two later, she got trained in my program, and basically had to sit with me, so I could show her how to do that portion of the job. We had an excellent conversation, and learned that we had a lot in common. She also sat by me the next day, and spoke a lot more, and found that we had even more in common! At this point, I knew that I really liked her. 

Throughout the following couple of weeks, she would track me down and sit with me at work, and we would share more meaningful conversation. We're both interested in traveling a lot and living a minimalistic and adventure-filled lifestyle. She later mentioned that another guy at work liked her, which made me lose hope for a while, but things didn't work out between them, so I was back in the game. She asked me for my phone number, which I gladly gave her. This gave me hope. This was before Christmas, and she still has yet to text me, and rarely replies to my Facebook messages. So, this whole time, I'm losing hope due to her not calling/texting me or replying to my messages, but when we're at work together, it's like magic. 

I recently asked her out for lunch, and she agreed. However, her not texting me or returning my messages got to me, and I tried to reschedule the lunch for a later date, but we just agreed to the original date, which is today. I've also been acting more distant toward her at work, not going out of my way to talk to her or anything. I've been so confused, that I was actually thinking about flaking on the lunch date. I ended up deciding to go through with the date, so I messaged her on Facebook today to set a time, and she told me that she picked up someone else's shift at work, and was no longer available for today.

That post was about two weeks ago and since I've had a lot more peace of mind.

Having asked that guy to let me know when he was back in town after Christmas break so we could hang out before I leave for 4 months- he didn't. Surprise. I talked to him a bit yesterday (I texted first) but didn't bring up hanging out. He did, however, RSVP to a going-away party that a mutual friend of ours is throwing for me.

I decided to just not text him anymore. Like the commenters said on post #1, it's pretty obvious he doesn't care anymore, so I'm just going to have to quit him and move on. The closer I get to my big trip, the easier its getting as I have lots of exciting things to focus on. Obviously if I see him around or if he gets in touch with me I'll be friendly because we do really get along, but the emotional back-and-forth I get from him just isn't a good use of my time or energy anymore. Took a while and a few slaps to the face to understand that.

In a completely unexpected plot twist, the same friend who's throwing the party wanted to set me up with a friend of his I had never met. Having only a few weeks left before I leave I was kind of just like Fuck it, what's the worst that could happen? and went out with him.

Six dates later, I really like this guy. It sucks that I kind of got attached before an extended absence, but he's really sweet and fun to be around and he wants to go out as much as possible before I leave. Obviously I'm not going to try and stick him with some sort of 'commitment' before I leave for four months, but I definitely want to see if things will go somewhere when I get home.

So I guess I'm making steps in the process of moving on completely. I still think about this guy a lot, but less so now, and I'm just focusing all my time and energy on spending my last week in Canada with the friends that care about me as much as I care about them, the new guy I'm seeing, and making sure the adventure I'm about to go on is one to remember.

A break turned into three weeks of conflicted anxious misery for me, and after two weeks of no contact, she broke up with me, citing that we needed to be individuals and lead our own lives- but that (of course) she still loved me, wanted me in her life, and cared for my well being.

I sometimes have to travel for work. I admit I cheated on my wife, was a total douchebag, jerkass, whatever, did it with a girl who was 23 at the time, but now is 25. She's a rock chick, dresses racy, has a great personality is fun.


When we have sex together, it feels like fireworks, hot, racy, fun and passionate, did it in hotels and after having fancy dinners at nice Italian or Chinese restaurants. We also seemed to have a connection, a bit like me and my wife did.

I'm torn between who to have - the fun, passionate girlfriend, or my wife, who's become very shouty, obsessed with finances, and too harsh on our daughter, who isn't a rebellious teenager, she's a good girl, gets good grades. My wife's lost her personality, and has become obsessed with money, chores, retirement plans, Obamacare, 401k, IRS etc. and doesn't want to have fun.

If I move in with my girlfriend, would the passion go out? She's been begging for me to move in with her, wants me to leave my wife, and have a passionate day-to-day existence with her.

21996,Breakups,2109xt,"So, this may be the most difficult thing I've had to deal with, only because I can't handle my ex gf. Our relationship has been toxic for a long time, and we've both acknowledged it but continued to try and get back to the glory days of what we once were. However, it was becoming more obvious that it might not actually happen afterall.

Last weekend, she was out with some friends and I decided to go out and celebrate my previous ex-gf's birthday (we dated in HS and little after college). Our relationship has been completely platonic, but my current ex-gf felt threatened so I never kept in touch. However, last week I decided to go celebrate her 30th Bday and didn't tell her. I know it was wrong, and I apologized and completely admit to being at fault. It was fucked up.

However, my gf showed up to my apt, and when she found that I wasn't there she started trashing it. She broke a mirror, emptied out my pre-workout supplement that I just purchased into the toilet and threw all my stuff on my dresser on to the ground. Of course I get home and we argued non-stop. It was at this point, when I realized that this is completely unhealthy and we need to break it off.

We didn't speak for a day or two, and I even got weak and emailed her saying I was sorry and that we should attempt to get back together, but she said she couldn't do it anymore. Her response felt like a slap to the face, but it woke me up and I couldn't have agreed more in that moment. A day or two later, I said we should definitely go our separate ways.

But this time, she didn't want that. She wanted to try again, but I was completely sure of my decision to end the relationship. It was extremely toxic and I need a clean break from all of this. I started talking to my friends about the situation, and they were all pretty glad.

Fast forward to last night, I was in bed and around 2am she barges into the apartment drunk. (She has keys because she used to live there but moved out during one of our fights). She wakes me up and starts yelling at me to tell her why. I was calm and trying to avoid arguing, but she wouldn't have any of it. She grabs my phone to look through it and I take it back. 

At one point, she grabs it again, and as I go to grab it from her hands, she starts to choke me from behind. I run to the living room and she tries again, and as I grab it back she starts to scream and hits me in the face with a keyboard (it was on the couch). I'm bleeding from the side of my face and tell her she needs to leave. But she just manages to get my phone again and runs to the bathroom, so I chase her and tell her to please leave me alone and try to get the phone back but she throws it into the toilet.

I don't know what to do. She wouldn't let me sleep, nor would she accept the fact that I don't want to be with her anymore. She says she refuses to leave and will move back into the apt soon (we were on the lease together originally, but starting May 1st, I will be the only one on it.

I'm considering taking legal action and possibly filing a restraining order. I'm in the process of changing the locks, but am I going crazy? After the scuffles, she played the victim because I shoved her away as she hit me and said I hurt her. Then she followed it by telling me about other guys in her life that she wishes she had pursued or something.

22005,Breakups,39imjx,"Hey I'll try to keep this short and sweet with the main points. I have been single for 4 years. I usually say it's because of school which is partly true but I have trouble putting myself out there and letting people in, especially attractive females. 

I recently came across my now ex girlfriend who had just moved into my apartment complex a couple months ago. I suggested we play some pool in my shy manner and she was down. We hit it off and acted like old friends. Attraction level was over 9,000 for both her and I. After going on a few dates and one particular incredible time, I asked her to be my girl. She accepted and everything was hunky-dory. 

The relationship seems to be going smooth for about 2-3 weeks, however, she notices things about me that remind her of her old relationship. I'm a gamer and dabble in 420 nightly but also have responsibilities of my own, particularly with school. 

She has very different interests than me but we had a sort of quirky chemistry that seemed to make it work. Anyways around week 4 I notice her being very distant with me. She would not respond to my text messages besides a once in a blue moon single word reply. She no longer visited me in the evenings and even stopped staying over for the night. I take a hint and give her space, I stop messaging her which seems to have a very light impact. 

Soon thereafter we agree to hang out for the evening. The minute she walks in I notice she is continuing to be distant with me and even avoiding me while she sits on my couch, messing with her phone trying to find rock climbing partners on an app.

She does this for 3 hours and I have finally had it, I directly ask her what's wrong, she says me asking whats wrong is whats wrong... I then force her to talk to me. She mentions how she needs to completely envelope herself in rock climbing, running, yoga, and dieting. I take up too much of her time and that's a problem. I then say how the relationship is then pointless because I am putting in so much effort and receiving nothing in return. I end the relationship and she seems completely unfazed. She did also mention how she was in a relationship pretty much her entire life since age 14.

Here I am today wondering when the next time I will see her will be and if we will hang out again. I can't help but be lonely and feel that I am missing something in my life which obviously is her (or more likely the mirage of happiness and the feeling of belonging for once).

Yes she seems self centered and I keep reminding myself of that, but it is still painful. I feel as if my recent bout of depression is returning with a vengeance and I feel powerless. I just want somebody to love and somebody that feels the same way about me.

Y and I have known X for two years, but it has been me and her who have always had the better relationship as best friends. During the majority of this time X had been dating some tool who she broke up with about 3 months ago. I have had feelings for her for over a year now and she admitted to me a few nights ago she felt the same. However, at breakup, Z came into the picture and her and I sort of hung out and stuff while Y and X did the same thing. 

It has come to the point where X cannot even look at me because she breaks down because we are not together. I really want to be with her, and I believe we will end up together. It is just the timing is completely shitty. Y is my best male friend and my other roommate agrees that he will stab me when he finds out that X and I have been hanging out and made out (twice) while they were seeing each other. Nothing more happened than making out. 
I like hanging out with Z but she just seems to be using me for attention, she says she likes me, but doesn't exactly want to be in a relationship at this point. 

Basically, I am scared to lose my best male friend, scared at the thought of a relationship with X, and Z is a great girl, but she is just too immature as of now.

I had three 'real' relationships so far, none lasted longer than 8 month. Slept with several women. My problem is just, that I don't feel the love. 

Often the girl is really, really in love with me and I like her. I am like the center of their world. But I don't feel connected, always thinking that I kind of pretend to be a person, which I am actually not. 

A little bit to my personality: I am very good and fun in a large group of friends, but once you meet me alone, I get boring pretty fast. I think it's hard for a lot of people to just spend time with me alone. Especially because they assume that I am way more exciting, than I am, because they got to know me in a group where I am very open, outgoing and hyperactive. 
I also am diagnosed with ADD and have anxiety attacks, with kind of depression. 

There are cases where I kind of fall in love with a girl, but this mostly one-sided and waaaaay to much. Like I feel anxious when this person is not around, jealousy and going crazy. Doesn't feel good. 

Do I just have to wait for the right person? Is it part of my development? I really wish to have a person with me, which finds me inspiring and I find her inspiring as well, easy to talk to and which makes me laugh.

22008,Dating,38o6kw,"Apologies for the length, but I'm a story-teller and love a Michael Crichton level of detail. Also, this is my first actual post. So woo, for popping that cherry.

Ok so I have this friend.  I'll call her A.  We became friends as coworker's back in 2006.  We went to our respective colleges, and have both ended up back in our home-city. When we had both moved back, after not seeing her for a few years.  We went out.  In my mind it was a date, I asked her out, I paid, hit up a few bars one night, and at the time was at least entertaining the idea of her in a non-friend capacity.  
So we go on a date one night, and I think it goes pretty well.  I get up the next day, and I'm just browsing facebook, and all of a sudden she's in a relationship.  (this was in 2012) I thought that was a bit fucked up, but thats how dating in your mid-twenties goes.

So I forget about it. 

Cut to November 2014.

She hits me up on FB messenger one day to see what up. We start talking and she asks if I want to get together for drinks sometime.  I say sure, and we end up meeting up the following Friday. We go out and have a good time catching up, have a few drinks and we end up back at my place where she stays the night. We continue to hang out over the next few weeks, and inevitably the whole what are we discussion comes up. This is where I tell her that I'm not looking for a super committed relationship, I'm fine hanging out, and no it doesn't mean I'm wanting to run around with every girl in town.  But I was very stern on the fact that I was not looking for a girlfriend. I'm in a creative field, and really enjoy my independence.

Also, not sure if it matters for the story. But I dated a girl for several years, and it ended horribly in a failed engagement.  I do believe in getting back on the horse, but it just isn't a concept that I'm looking into at this point in my life.  

Another detail: I had gotten on her FB after this discussion only to eventually figure out she had split with the guy she had gotten in a relationship with earlier in my story.  About 2 weeks prior to her messaging me again on FB in 2014. So I immediately get this sense that she's the type that is always looking for the boyfriend role to be filled.

Anyway.  She seems to understand my point and be ok.  Only for the same discussion to basically be brought up every week or so.  

So finally, about a month and a half of our casual dating, I tell her that I don't think its going to work.  That I feel like she is wanting way more out of this than I can provide. I was completely honest.  I told her that I'm fine being friends, but that I'm not in a place to be in a relationship with someone right now, nor am I looking for that.

She was upset but eventually got over it. So we don't see each other for a week or two, and she eventually starts texting me again.  

Also note: I am genuinely interested in remaining friends.  That wasn't just a line.

So we start hanging out as friends again, and we have a few mutual friends we'll hang with.

So since then (about the end of january/early febuary) she texts me just about every morning saying something or the other.  But most of our text conversations go like this:
     A: Hey! So we're gonna go out to a bar tomorrow if you want to go.
    ME: Yeah maybe.  I may have other plans but, I'll see what's going on. I'll let you know when I figure it out.
     A: Ok, well if you can't hang then I think we were gonna do something the day after.

....etc etc.

She is always, ALWAYS, trying to figure out the next time she'll see me is.  As well as when she texts me, she writes texts about as long as this post, and there will be 5 or 6 of these things.  It stresses me out, gives me anxiety.  Who has the time!? For Serial.

Now this has progressed to a point when they do go out, she'll text me. (this situation has happened a number of times) I'll tell her that it was kind of last minute and that I probably can't do it that particular night.  

She gets livid.  Starts texting me all this drama about how if it were me, she'd rally and come out.  Or whatever.  Basically me saying, Yo, I just kind of want to have a night at home chilling isn't enough of a reason.  Which pisses me off.  I have every right to sit at home alone redditing and smoking weed if I want.

She lays on the massive guild trip.  With really no guilt other than knowing that I'm a people pleaser and her basically just being kind of a mean and bitchy about it. Acting like we're dating, when we most certainly are not. 

Also note: When I ended things, I did end things.  There have been no relations since.

Another note: She only gets like this when she's drinking.  Which she doesn't quite a bit, and does tend to get a bit sloppy as the night goes on.  Which I do not find attractive in the slightest.  I like to drink, but I've got my shit down.

I later put 2 + 2 together and figure out here scheme.  I noticed that anytime I go out and drink with our friends, she finds someway to end up back at my place.... too fucked up to drive. It happened once, okay. It happens.  Now I've noticed it happens every time I drink with her.  Its almost as if I can see her wheels and gears turning trying to figure out how to get back to my house.  

There was one night where she had people at her place to grill out.  She gets drunk, I go to leave once its winding down.  She pulls the biggest fit to come with me.  So I said fuck it, I'm tired, get in the damn car.  I made her sleep on the couch, she pouted about it, then I had to drive her back home the next day ( across town) before getting to work late.

Every time she acts like this she apologizes. But still, its like, wtf is the point of apologizing if we know next weekend you're gonna get shit-faced and do it again?

My problem?
I absolutely have no desire to have sex with her, or have any relationship in anyway other than a friendship. I'm not attracted to her in that way, at all. AT ALL.  I've told her this.  But it is starting to make me feel guilty because she's always bringing over weed, or beer, or food, or basically whatever we need for whatever activities.  She doesn't mind picking up the tab.  She does have a pretty killer job, so it could just be that.  But either way, it makes me feel guiltly.  Should I feel guilty?

Secondly, I don't have any ladies on my radar right now.  But it will eventually happen... which will be a huge shit-show on her end.  

I feel like she is okay with being friends right now.  I feel like she is really trying to convince (for lack of a better term) me that she's worthy (again, for lack...)

Either way the whole thing stresses me out.  I want to be her friend,  she's fun when she isn't trying to seduce me. We also have mutual friends.  No clue what I should do.  Its annoying.

22012,Infidelity,38y8kg,"I've been with my girlfriend for a little over 1 year. We're long distance, total time physically together about 4 months, met each other's families, travelled all over, very serious.


5 months ago, before she'd visited my home country and met my family, but after the point we were saying we loved each other, she was seduced by an older guy she'd just met who straight out said she was sexy and he wanted her, and she ended up kissing him. He was on a business trip in her country and pursued her as soon as they met, she has low self-esteem so felt flattered and excited but said she had a boyfriend and didn't want to cheat, he convinced her he just wanted some company, so they went for some drinks and weren't drunk but after hanging out until 3am, she made the move to kiss him on the spur of the moment as she didn't think she would ever see him again and figured I would never find out. Not a fleeting kiss, a make out session for a few minutes.


I sussed it out immediately because she's a very unsophisticated liar, but she continued to try lying for a couple of days until I finally got all the details out of her when she came to visit. The hardest part was it happened just days before she was coming to see me. She says she never meant it to happen, she was craving affection and company and got curious because she found him very attractive but had no other feelings for him, and after all of his pestering she wanted to turn the tables on him and show him that she was the one in control (something to do with feeling lost and out of control in the months prior, which has some truth to it).


I'm her first boyfriend and she's immensely naive and immature at times (she's had a very sheltered upbringing and still lives at home). Although I was the other side of the planet at the time, I was able to suss out what happened just from all the clues she gave away. (Before anyone tells me I'm the naive one - she didn't have sex with him, and I know this for certain, but don't worry about how I know because that's a distraction).


I was inches from ending the relationship. She said she'd thought our relationship might not last and that being long distance for so long she almost forgot she *was* in a relationship and just wanted to experience the fun of feeling single, but was too immature to set boundaries properly and ended up doing something she regrets on the spur of the moment. She insists that she didn't enjoy it and realised straight away that she never wants to lose me and I'm so much better than him and he was an awful kisser and blah blah blah.


I have fought with the dilemma for months now. Our relationship is very intense and loving, we have crazy amounts of desire for each other and all kinds of future plans, and ever since the incident, she has gone to great lengths to tell me everything she does, to ask what is OK for her to do, to show she's ready for commitment and to answer honestly any and all questions I have about the incident. She's pulled together all her savings to buy a flight to see me again. She is absolutely insistent that it was a mistake of immaturity, that she did love me but not as deeply as she does now that she's visited me and my family in my home country, that she hadn't thought through the lack of boundaries that led to this happening as a stupid spur of the moment thing, and that she will do whatever it takes to regain my trust and to be a mature woman. 


I am trying my hardest to trust again, but I sporadically get hit with terrible anxiety. She has suffered since she got caught and shamed about it straight away and I know she's had a bit of a crisis of identity over it, and has endured my months of occasional mood swings and need for reassurance, which have made me feel like an anxious nag and that I should either move on now or just forgive properly and forever shut up about it. 


She's very attractive, so I know guys will be coming on to her all the time, and she has a very high sex drive. That was amazing before, but now it feels stressful when we're apart. Lately I even get stressed when she naively points out which actors or models she finds attractive and I start wondering what would happen if someone who looked like that hit on her.


Here's the real snag. We're from different continents, so the only realistic way we can be together is through marriage. And right now I am afraid of what may happen in the future when the honeymoon period wears off, because I sure as hell know guys are going to be giving her those opportunities if she wants them. However, if we're physically together, I think she'll have her needs met, we will develop real trust, and she will mature quickly. I don't want to end our relationship out of spite or paranoia, but I do need to feel secure and safe.


So what is the real problem here? Her - for breaking my trust, me - for being too anxious to move on and forgive properly, or both of us - for getting into something hopelessly complicated and not being on the same level of maturity?

I lost a ton of weight, and made a ton of friends in the past year, and basically started at square one in terms of dating. In the past year the majority of friends I make tend to be women, who I get really close to but haven't dated any of them. They're all younger than me (19-22), since I got a late start to college. I have dated outside of my social circle, but nothing lasts more than a month or so. I've also been in therapy this entire time.

So I have a bunch of girls that I do everything with, but for the most part it's me initiating most of our hangouts. It sort of sucked putting most of the effort in, but we were having a lot of fun so I was just rolling with it. I think on some level I didn't really like them as people, but I was just hanging out with them so that I could socialize. Eventually they introduce me to a girl, Sandra, that's in their social circle. She's also in a long distance relationship, but they see each other once a month and she always brings him up. We instantly click and start spending a lot of time together. She was one of the nicest people I've met and generally cared about me. It was a really nice change of pace because Sandra was actually inviting me out to do things and setting up shit for us to do as a group. The thing was these 'group' things always turned into just us two doing things together, because the rest of the group always backed out. I didn't really care because I really liked hanging out with her. Sometimes I would pay for dinner or whatever else, but for the most part she said she would always get me next time or pay me back.

Eventually, a few weeks ago she was going away and we went out before she left. We both crashed at a mutual friends, in the same bed, which was the friends idea and I didn't see it as a big deal (and neither did she). Apparently one of the other friends saw it as a huge deal and thought something was going on, but absolutely nothing happened. My therapist thought this was an invitation from her that she wanted something more, and I know some people might think that too, but in the moment it really felt platonic. 

For what it's worth, my therapist says me paying for things and sleeping in the same bed as her are definitely crossing a line, not just on my part but definitely also on Sandra's. So my therapist is unsure about what exactly is going on, and I'm confused too since I'm a baby in terms of relationships. She think's its a good relationship for me but I really need to work on making guy friends so that attraction isn't an issue in relationships, but that's something I'm working on. 

So my basic dilemma is I'm obviously into her, but not sure what to do about it. Do I talk to her? Back off? I really think this is a good relationship for me since it's the first time I've had someone taking me out to do things and it's not all effort on my part. I can't really back off because we have spent a bunch of money for events in the next few weeks to go to together, and I really have fun with her and feel cared about by her. I feel like shit about being into her because she does talk about how good her boyfriend is, but at the same time we are getting much closer than I have to a girl before.

22028,Breakups,1plly7,"So we broke up a while ago after being together for a year and a half and it was totally mutual.  We talked about it for a long time and decided it was best.  We broke up because I suffer from really bad depression and wasn't taking my pills and was kind of freaking out about our relationship and making us both miserable.

We still hang out regularly and have sex when we're drunk together.  To be honest, it doesn't even feel like we're broken up.  I have a lot of fun with him and he's a really sweet guy.  And when I take my pills everything goes fine.  But I hate taking them.  And I don't know if me being unhappy was because I wasn't on them or because I was genuinely unhappy in the relationship.

I guess I'm just looking for some impartial advice.  I've tried talking to my friends about it but they just criticize me for trying to stay good friends with him and say these feelings are just because of that.  He's a great guy to have in your life and I would hate to lose him all together.

22030,Dating,2iqrg6,"So I [M/22 then 21] met this girl [F/20] at the end of last year, just after I'd broken up with my first girlfriend of 4 years. It was at an end of college block party during the day. We started talking when mutual friends brought us together. We spent the entire rest of the day talking even after the party was over. I'd just gotten out of a relationship, so I wasn't really ready for anything serious, but I was too interested by our conversation to even try to make a move on her. Anyway, the day ended and she went home. We texted a few more times but didn't end up seeing each other again before the summer started.

Over the summer, she texted me once. We talked briefly, but that was it.

Once we got back to school, I should have asked her out, but I couldn't figure out a way to build up the courage, as I didn't know if she still liked or even thought of me from before summer. Ultimately this culminated in me drunk texting her a very long elaborate text that thoroughly embarrassed sober me. Her response boiled down to Next time you like someone, ask them on a date, idiot.

A week after that, I got over my mortification and asked her out for coffee. She said yes, so we met for coffee. We both seemed to have a good time. The next day, I asked her for coffee the following week. Again, she said yes. Again, we seemed to have a good time.

I had a date night coming up with my fraternity so I decided to invite her. At the date night, we were both fairly drunk but she seemed to have a great time. I had her laughing at my jokes, and she told me a little private info about herself (about her relationship with her parents) and casually mentioned me meeting her residents(she's an RA). She did snapchat and text a male friend while there, but she was very careful to make sure I knew he was completely platonic. I was pretty sure she liked me at this point.

At the end of the night, she and I and another couple headed home together. We hold hands and walk down the street to my friend's house. While walking back, my friend's date indicates that she wants to go home and brings my date with her. Before the two of them leave, my date kissed me on the lips.

That was last Friday. Since then, it's like everything's changed. I invited her to do something that Saturday, she said she was too busy. I inquired about grabbing coffee the coming week, she said she was too busy. Finally, I texted her something bland earlier today and got no response at all.

Now, it should be said that I'd been hooking up with other girls while this courtship was happening. My rational behind it was that I'd been in a relationship prior to this for 4 years and I wasn't willing to put my life on hold again for a girl who I'm not sure if she likes me. Further awkwardness comes from the fact that one of the girls I'd hooked up with prior to the date night is apparently very good friends with the girl who left with my date.

So now my confusion is this: It seems clear to me that she's now not interested but, I left the date night feeling really good about us and now I feel like I've missed something obvious. First of all, is there any way I can try to salvage this an start dating this girl or is it a lost cause? Is there any possibility this is just some head game? Second of all, if the potential relationship is beyond repair, is there any socially acceptable way of finding out what happened so I don't do it again? We don't have any classes together or any good mutual friends so casual run-ins are out. I'd just ideally like to see this girl again, if only to figure out what happened.

I'd had a girlfriend for 4 years before this and while I don't miss her. I forgot how much I dislike the beginning of dating someone, and how bad I am at it.

Few months back my GF , who was with me for 3+ years, left me.
There was a misunderstanding and we ended up fighting .

I've forgotten the fight and really want her back. Unfortunately, she says she has lost that 'love' towards me after the fight and does not want me back.

The way she has been talking to me, she seems to be in half mind.
While she wants to come back, she is kind of reluctant.

Now I have an idea to get her back. I want to create a video compilation for her.

The video would be of 8-10 people from different countries saying the following in their native language:

**Sneha(her name) please forgive him. He loves you the most and misses you. So please give him a second chance.**

My idea is to have 8-10 people saying this and then I would make a video compilation of it.

2) A big smile

3) (Optional) If possible, use some props.

22035,Breakups,26ztsb,"I'm still very shellshocked at the moment so I apologise if I leave anything out. I've been going out with my girlfriend for roughly 8 months now. It took a long time for us to finally accept our feelings for each other and get together, but ever since it has been amazing. We make each other laugh, we make each other cry - it is a very passionate, caring relationship.

A week ago, something very major happened in her family that she refuses to tell me about. She says that it is a very private family problem, and it is currently too raw to talk about it with people. For the past week she has pretty much been at home, only getting 1/2hrs sleep a night, not eating well and crying a lot of the time. She's been spending all of her time with her family, cancelling social events because she didn't feel up to it. She hasn't even told her friends what happened.

Last night I finally convinced her to come out and we had a beautiful night walking around the city. At the end of the night we begin talking, and she said this situation has rocked her to her core and she doesn't think things will be the same with her again. I tried so hard to get her to open up to me, and told her numerous times that no matter what it was I'd be there to support her.

I'm going to Europe in July for 2 months, and it's been creeping up on us for a while. She's the type of girlfriend who needs a lot of your love, time and support. I have always given that to her to make sure she is satisfied. But last night she said that since the incident in her family happened, all she has been able to do is invest time and energy worrying about that, and she doesn't think she can do a relationship right now especially when I'll be away for 2 months and she wont be able to rely on me anymore.

She explained that she believed relationships work both ways, and if she isn't able to be there for me emotionally then she doesn't believe it's fair on me. I tried telling her that it didn't bother me and all I want is to make sure she's alright, but she wasn't having any of it. It was a very sad moment and we both ended up in tears at the end.

I know she is going through something very difficult in her life right now, but I had no idea things were that bad that would make her end a relationship over. She doesn't want me, she doesn't want to tell her friends about it who are worried sick about it... overall, I believe she is making the wrong decision.

When we hugged, cried and looked into each other's eyes last night, I could tell she was hurting so much. But I could also see that she's still madly in love with me like I am with her. Earlier that day, we were messaging for hours and were laughing a lot, and even planned on coming back to my place to spend the night as we hadn't seen each other properly in ages.. it's all very confusing.

Reddit, I really need to know what my best course of action from now should be. I leave to go overseas for a month, but I still desperately want to be with her. I believe she wants to be with me too, but is scared and emotionally fragile at the moment. I really don't want to let her go, but I don't want to seem like I'm pushing to get her back either during this hard time for her.

Since last night she sent me a message early this morning saying how sorry was was and that she still cares about me so much. She said I hope you aren't hurting as much as I am right now, because if you'll be ok I'll be ok.

Am I meant to stick around as a friend and support her? Or make a clean break, respect her decision and give her the space she wants? I'm very confused right now, any help would be amazing.

22038,Dating,2us0pn,"I hope I'm in the right place - I'm an American girl who has been diagnosed at different times since adolescence with narcissistic personality disorder and borderline personality disorder, as well as ADD which I'm currently not medicating for personal reasons. I've lived in a very traditional country in Eastern Europe for a few years now, for no reason other than because I can. Therapy isn't a thing here, unfortunately.... I am not trying to use this board as a substitute, but I'd love some rational advice.



Despite my personality disorders I'm pretty self aware. I know I can be very entitled, dramatic, manipulative, fake, and constantly testing guys who are interested in me. I know how to use people to get what I want, and I wish I could stop. It does not help that I'm very conventionally attractive (only reason I mention it is because I think it feeds my narcissism to get so much male attention and everything paid for by guys who think they have a chance). Anyway, I'm not happy with myself or my behavior, but I don't know how to change.



I have to, though - I recently (4 weeks ago) met a guy who is worth it. Dan is a local of the country I live in, so there's a cultural difference, but we get along extremely well, with entertaining conversations, similar interests, mutual friends, etc. I really admire his ambition, sense of humor, and loyalty to family and friends - moreover, he seems like a totally genuine person, and I find him very attractive. I've never been in a relationship before, and I certainly can't jump into one, but I see potential here....



So please help me not screw this up! I can't be myself, because I'll either scare him away or treat him in a way he doesn't deserve. Somehow, I want to be better for him, and I need concrete suggestions. I have helped him, his brother and sister with a couple of big favors so far, and I met his mom for the first time today. We have been hanging out 3 or 4 times a week, sometimes with friends and sometimes one on one. He always takes me out, but that's part of the culture here, it's patriarchal. No sex yet, just kisses. He's looking for a relationship, and he has been a complete gentleman so far, but did give me an indication he can see through my surface charm - he said the other day, you seem like the kind of girl who always gets what she wants. Not sure what to think of that.


Anyway, he is out of town for the next week. And I want to surprise him with something small when he comes back (he won't let me take him out to dinner or spend money on him ) and just generally get a grip on my narcissist/bpd tendencies to give this relationship a chance. If you have experience with personality disorders or these kind of traditional societies I'd be super grateful for advice. Thanks for reading.

I will try to make this as short as possible and I appreciate anyone who is going to read that.

To begin with, you need to know that I still like her and I think we are nearly perfect for each other. 

**Pre-Story**

(If someone wants to know more on how we got together (which is a pretty long story as well) I will post it here, I just didn't think it is that necessary)

First of all I had a long distance relationship with my ex about 19 months ago. It wasn't the longest relationship (~6 months) but it was perfect. I did some stupid mistakes back then and we broke up more or less in peace. There was no hate on both sides. 
So she moved to another city and I didn't see her at all till yesterday. We had some contact via skype or SMS but nothing serious but it was always a happy conversation.

What happened in the last 2 weeks was, that she was at her parents (her old place where she lived) for holidays and we began to write a lot of SMS and eventually started talking via telephone - like we used to when we where together - whole nights long and we would talk about everything.   
Her holidays ended yesterday and she asked me if I want to meet her on her way home. It was the first time she asked that after our breakup.
I kinda hesitated but I always wanted to meet her again and of course I was hell of nervous.
So I agreed and we met yesterday.


**Story**

Ok here I am, standing at the railway platform waiting for her to arrive. 
We met and she was so happy to see me witch resulted in a really long hug. 

*And after that comes the important first note:* We wanted to lock her things away and she had no change and so she gave me her wallet so she can look for someone to change her money. The first thing I saw, even though I just held it, was a photo of a guy - could have been her boyfriend. Maybe she forgot about that but some moments later she ran to me yanking her wallet out of my hand. I have no idea.

Anyways, we walked through town and beside lots of body contact (poking, tackling and teasing ) that came from her - and I responded the same way - we had a lot of fun.
We ate Sushi (we used to do that when we where together) and went shopping.
Eventually we looked for a place to sit in a big shopping mall and she was looking at her phone, telling me she had to talk to her dad real quick.

*Which leads us to the second important note:* She was calling her dad I was sitting there and she just walks away out of my view so I couldn't see her talking at all. 
I hope this doesn't sound too weird..

Anyways we sat down in a Starbucks afterwards she was leaning against me - it was kinda cosy - and playing Pokémon together.
I noticed that she always smiled really happy when I looked at her. 


I have no idea what to think about all that. I really like this girl, even though we broke up long time ago *but for this one day* we could have been a couple - I barely noticed any difference to the time back then (just no kissing nor holding hands)

So what is going on?

Can I ask her about a boyfriend she might have?

Can I asked her about any feelings for me?

Is there a way how I can work this out? I have the feeling everything I might do next could be a giant fail.   
I really appreciate any help or tips from everyone here.
Thank you for reading

22046,Dating,1nqvei,"Hi y'all, hoping you can help.

Back in May, I met up with a guy on Match. Let's call him Sam. Sam and I texted back and forth for a little bit, talking mostly about books. I agreed to meet up with him and we met at a popular restaurant downtown - and it was *okay*. I'm a naturally sociable person and he was struggling to keep up with conversation unless we were talking about books or history. I don't mind talking about either of those things, but we didn't really get to know each other. I eventually want to start heading home as I'm yawning, so we leave, and I give him a hug goodbye. I was leaving for Mexico the next week so he wished me a safe trip, and I said goodbye. 

I wasn't entirely too interested and when I got back from Mexico, I just got distracted and didn't hear from him, so I assumed that he wasn't interested as well. 

Time goes on and I start getting texts from a mysterious number about book recommendations, things to do in the city nearest me, and some other things. I had no idea where these texts were coming from and chose not to reply, as they were about once every month or so. I didn't keep the texts in my inbox and failed to notice the phone number, but it finally clicked.

Last month, I got a series of messages from him on Match that forced me to close my profile. He would send almost novels about books I should read (which then clicked that the weird number texting me was actually him), movies coming out, where he'd like to take me on our next date. I ignored the first one. The second one came and reiterated how great I was and how much he'd like to see me, and I started getting creeped out. I didn't want to confront him and say anything, so I just blocked him from contacting me on Match and on my phone. I come to find out that he has a second ghost account and he kept winking at me. I quickly deleted my account. 

Last night, he friended me on Facebook. I have not given him any personal details other than my first name (not even my nickname that my FB profile goes by!) and my phone number. I just saw the photo and I freaked out a little bit. My Facebook is set to the highest privacy settings and no personal details are available to the general public, other than my name and networks.

I'm really nervous about him finding me on other social networks (LinkedIn, some of the forums that I'm active on within my town, the yoga studio that I frequent and volunteer at, etc) and I do NOT want to confront him in person. So, Reddit, what should I do? I'm honestly at a loss and I obviously don't want to deactivate my FB which keeps me in touch with my close friends and family around the globe. 

**TLDR** Went on one date with a guy, haven't contacted him since May, and he just friended me on Facebook. What should I do?

22048,Breakups,1nhkta,"TL;DR Relationship is generally good, normal ups and downs, but we have certain incompatibilities that I feel render us not capable of going for the long haul, so we should probably break up now that there's the opportunity of me moving 3000 miles away for ten months. But neither of us is emotionally ready to break up.

This is my longest non-platonic relationship, and in fact my first truly serious, monogamous relationship, and the first time I've been in love. I didn't expect the end of our relationship to play out this way and I keep trying to work it out in my head any other way but I just don't know what's best for both of us and thought some outside perspective might help.

We've had our ups and downs like all couples, were actually having a not great time for most of the summer and up until pretty recently. A few weeks ago I would have been totally ready to end things, but of course now we've been having a very very good period of always being very happy around each other, having great sex, and so on. Due to this, now I'm really not sure about breaking up and the thought of leaving him frequently puts me in tears. I'm moving to the very opposite side of the country for ten months, and while I feel fairly prepared to leave my home, friends, and family, I'm really scared of losing this comforting relationship...

Sorry, been kind of rambling so far, I haven't been able to vent about this with anyone because I don't want to bring him down too much by talking about it, he's as broken up as I am. Here's why I think it would be logical to break up:

- Staying together would be unfair for him. I'm going to be very busy for the ten months and also not have my own transportation, plus moving away at the end of it, so I'm not going to be capable of pursuing anything anyway. But he'll just be living his normal life, so he could pursue someone promising he met while I was gone.
- I have had some issues with him, though to be honest they've gotten better and we haven't had any of these issues in months. He's just sometimes said pretty rude, disrespectful things/thought about things in ways I found very incompatible with my own views. Also he didn't have a job for almost a year and was living off of his parents, which I found exceedingly frustrating, though he did get a retail job a few weeks ago finally. I do think he was looking throughout that year, but not as seriously as he could/should have been. This is pretty disappointing to me. Plus, he didn't finish a college degree, then graduated from culinary school instead and now doesn't want to cook, so I just don't know what his future will be like.
- Though this doesn't necessarily make a huge impact on who I choose to stay with, my immediate family (brother, mom, and dad) are all really disapproving and give me shit for being with him all the time. Their reasons are not reasons I consider valid and this doesn't affect the love I feel for him, but it makes it generally tougher/more awkward than the situation is with his family who like me. I try to go to his house a lot more than have him come here, and obviously this wouldn't be a problem when someday we have our own living situations, but it still just generally sucks.
- He's an extremely monogamous person, and I'm just not. For one thing I'm bisexual, so one person of one gender is just not enough to satisfy my sexuality, I miss being with women horribly. I also just don't feel jealousy in any way, and enjoy having sex without emotional attachment, getting to have new partners every now and then, etc. I'd love to have a boyfriend I could high five with over our respective hook ups, as I've had in the past. But he's very jealous, looks down on/would never consider having a hook up, etc. 
- Obviously I've stuck with monogamy this long for his sake, and have even come to see some benefits of it and have enjoyed it in some ways, but I can't see myself doing so for my entire life, I just think I'm wired differently. Plus it seems unfair that I'm doing all the compromise and he's doing none. Although I should add that throughout our relationship I've wanted to be with him, not anyone else, well obviously since I've stuck with him/monogamy, and I don't see that changing in the foreseeable future. So I guess that's basically what monogamy is, wanting to be with one person over anyone else, but I still can't help but sometimes feel like I wish I could have him AND have the type of poly arrangement that's more my thing.
- Though I wouldn't call our sex life vanilla, we definitely have a pretty exciting and active sex life, I have a real need for power exchange based Dom/sub type play. It's something I've been doing since I was a preteen, and something I consider very important to feeling fully satisfied with my sex life and fully psychologically satisfied in general. Going without it for a year and a half has been pretty rough. We've tried to compromise on this, he's made attempts, but he just doesn't really get it, which I understand, because much like monogamy isn't something I'm predisposed towards, D/s isn't for him. But here again is an area where I've made a huge sacrifice and he's made none...

So yeah. When I think about staying together and doing an LDR, all I can think about is where would I be when I got back? I'd be back to my very comfortable, very loving relationship, but with the same general problems. Though a lot of these problems bother me a lot less than they did towards the beginning of the relationship/have gotten better in various ways, it still seems as if we can't stay together forever given these pretty big roadblocks. 

So are we just wasting time we could have to find our more permanent partners? It doesn't feel like wasted time to me because I love him, but I don't want to look back with regret a few years down the line... And I don't know when we'd ever find a good breaking point because we do enjoy being around each other so much; me moving away feels like an opportunity. Plus the thought of an LDR is just tough, we both love physical affection and generally interact better in person than through webcam/chat/text. It would be easier for me to go ten months celibate/cuddle free if I was single than if I had my love waiting for me at home...

SORRY this was so long, I just have been dwelling on all of this pretty intensely, and am completely lost. My head says now is the time to end it and that of course my first serious relationship/first love wasn't going to pan out, but my heart is absolutely broken and wants to hold on to it, plus I'm so afraid of not being able to find something like this again.

22075,Breakups,223wb8,"My girlfriend initiated a mutual breakup last evening. We had been planning a trip, and even weekend plans right up until the moment she arrived at my place last night. I want to leave this story with you, partly for the sake of writing things out, and partly to see what you think. 
	

I can never seem to get past the whole “You should have done more to keep her, and show her you appreciate her” thing that I know so many of us do following a breakup. 
	

I am a 32 student in a professional degree program; she is 24 and a working professional. We met through a mutual friend; we were together for about eight months. 
	

We got along great for the first four months or so: we were together regularly, despite both of us being students with rather busy schedules; the sex was fantastic; and I got along great with her family, and the few friends of hers that I met. 
	

One night, while at my place, she became sullen, and closed-off. After repeatedly asking her to open up, she revealed that she had been sexually assaulted in some way by an adult stranger when she was a teenager. After revealing this, and crying, she closed back up, refusing to discuss anything further. I cried a bit, because I hated to see her in pain. I told her that I would be there for her, for anything. This issue never came up, again.
	

Another night, she treated me to a quick dinner at a restaurant nearby her place. We talked and laughed, and it looked as though we were settling into another low-key night together of tea-drinking and movie-watching. All of a sudden, she made a cynical, biting remark about me regarding the fact that I hadn’t visited her enough during her three-day bout with strep throat. (My defense had always been that I would do anything for her while she was sick, but, I thought it best to leave her to her mother’s constant care.) I asked her if she was serious, and asked that she discuss with me what she had just said, however, she became sort of flippant, saying “Nothing, nothing, don’t worry about it”. We walked back to her place in silence; I told her I refused to continue the night unless she was honest with me about this seeming elephant in the room. We went up, and she started crying, telling me she hated how I was always on my phone around her (I assure you that I made it a point to put my phone away when I was with her) and how I would always text her instead of call her (again, I texted half of the time, and called half of the time). Not once before had she indicated her taking issue with any of this. Instead, she bottled it up, and broke down. 
	

I made it a point to call her each time from then on, instead of texting. I continued to keep my phone out of sight when with her. She was happy.
	

About two weeks later, during sex one morning, I lost my erection. This happens sometimes but not often. (I feel like I’m not a morning person. I notice that my sex drive rises dramatically once I have risen from bed, had breakfast and coffee.) She became sullen, and upset. I implored her not to take it personally, and that this happened to me sometimes. It was my problem. I reminded her why I was with her: among other things, of course, I was extremely attracted to her. She went around the apartment, getting ready to leave, and refused to say anything. When I tried to discuss what was happening, she blew up at me, yelling and crying that I “… don’t make her feel beautiful”. She left. 
	

(Note that I told her every time I complimented her in any way, she would get defensive, and say something like “Whatever” or “Mm hmm, yup, okay…”.) It got to the point where I would say “It would make me feel great if you accepted my compliment.” It was a thing: she didn’t like being told she was beautiful, or that I liked what she was wearing, or whatever. I dealt with it. Okay. She doesn’t like it – I’ll move on. No big deal.
	

She arrived back that night, and said that we don’t have enough sex. Even though we had been together for about five months so far, this was a “deal-breaker” for her, and she was prepared to leave unless I did something about it. I consulted my doctor, switched blood-pressure medication, and made a concerted effort to raise my libido through more vigorous exercise, among other things. Note: we had been having sex about three times each week, whenever we were together. Following this issue being brought up, we had sex about four times per week. She never brought the issue up, again. She indicated that the problem was fixed.
	

Some final considerations: sometimes (well, often), she’d fall silent when we were together, and would not say anything. I can do comfortable silences; however, these were never comfortable. I would ask what was up, and why she was so quiet, and she would simply stare back at me, responding with, “Sometimes I have nothing to say”. I couldn’t get her to talk about anything.  I would ask her to tell me about everything: her studies, friends, and the like. She would never ask me anything about my life. I just wanted to have a true conversation, you know, an exchange of ideas like anyone would with their partner.
	

She would also sometimes bring up what I would call rules for herself: “I keep my boyfriends and my friends separate”; “I don’t miss anything when it’s no longer around”; etc. I never really met her core group of friends.
        

She once indicated that a previous boyfriend had told her not to eat. 


Her habit of bottling things up, and passive-aggressively blowing up at me sort of threw me. I was ready to leave following the sex fight, because she refused to listen to me, and I felt like she made my problem completely about her. Her refusals to engage me in any meaningful conversation also took its toll because I came to feel that her company was less and less desireable. However, I didn’t want to give up on the relationship. I made it a point to try to talk our issues through, and coax the best out of her. I was with her for a reason: above all, she was a really awesome person, loyal and kind. 


And so, right up until her arrival at my place last night, she spoke of her excitement about me meeting a girlfriend who was coming home in a few weeks, about a wedding we would be attending this summer, and about our coming vacation together. 


She said something was missing, and it killed her that she couldn’t find out what it was because I was the “perfect partner”. I finally told her that I didn’t feel like I could convince her any longer of the relationship’s worth. She said we should part, and we did. She was surgical about it, and now she’s almost cold, posting cheerily on Facebook, and letting me know I could pick something of mine up at my convenience.


That’s it. I agreed with her that we couldn’t do this any longer.


But I’m sad, and I miss her. It’s that sort of sadness that comes when you lose someone who came into your life, and cared about you, even for eight months.


In no way do I feel like my situation in unique; we all go through breakups of varying complexities. 


Thanks, everyone, for listening to me.

22079,Dating,2uobef,"Hi everyone,


I met a girl through a friend, and we decided to have a casual relationship (exclusive but no emotions, just for fun, and if either of us started to feel anything we would break it off).  We fooled around a few times, and then one night I went over to her house after having a few drinks and we had sex.


I didn't have any condoms, and I assumed she was on birth control, but I asked her partway through to confirm and turns out she wasn't so I pulled out.  We did this once that night and again in the morning.


So the next day we're talking, and I ask her what would happen if she ended up becoming pregnant.  She says she'd keep the baby.  This scares me a little, so I suggest the morning after pill just to be safe, and she says no because she doesn't like putting things in her body, and had a bad experience with some medication in the past (acne medication that gave her some severe depression).  We talk a bit more and learn that she is currently on day 10 of her cycle, so fairly close to ovulation.


So for that past few days, I've been pretty much freaking out.  I know all I can do is wait until her next period and hope there's no baby, but I am absolutely terrified.  I realize what I did was pretty stupid; I should have asked about birth control before we ever had sex in the first place.  


I guess at this point I'm looking for opinions on my situation.  Is she being fair?  Am I being fair?  (I did pressure her a little about the morning after pill).  Do you have any advice to help me relax for the next few weeks?


Edit: I realize what I did was stupid.  Once I find out whether or not she is pregnant I will cut contact with her.  Please go a little easier on me guys; I've agreed I made a big mistake.  30 years and I've never been in a situation like this.  I just went through a breakup and had had a bunch of drinks so my judgement slipped for a bit.

I did become apparent that he is a real nerd, not like those hipsters that call themselves nerds. Very awkward and nervous, while being very kind and gentelmanly. So, we hung out again about a week later and ended up going back to his house to watch a movie. At the end of the night, he kissed me. I wasn't expecting it, but I kissed back. Well, tried to... it was weird. The best I can explain it is that it reminded me of Zoidberg. It was like he was dragging his bottom lip from my chin up to my bottom lip while puckering his top lip rapidly like slobbery tentacles. I didn't know what to do, so I attempted to kiss him again a possibly lead, but no he kissed me like that again. And he had this huge smile on his face like oh yeah, that's good stuff right there for your mouth. So I nicely excused myself, told him I had a good time, and didn't mention the kiss. I decided to look past it and we went out again this past Saturday...

We had a great time Saturday. I was anticipating another kiss, not in a good way. I didn't want it to happen. It did though... he did it the same exact way. I actually turned my head and wiped my mouth and just kind of stared in another direction for a bit. Then when I turned my head back around he kissed me again and I closed my mouth tight, like I sucked on a lemon so maybe he would get the hint. Nope, he still had that smile on his face when I pulled back. Then, this morning he texted me, I miss your face. My response a couple hours later,  :) .

Because of the distance and an unexpected surgery (mine) we were never able to meet in person, although we got along very well doing all the typical LDR things (phone, text, skype). We would also send each other packages of things we found interesting that the other might like, and all in all everything seemed good.

However there were also things that stood out to me as potential warnings, like how she talked about her ex (gf thought she called her wife without having any ceremony). Or how she would talk about teams and things she was on and not getting along with anyone. She also uses a nickname for my I've expressed not liking as I feel that it doesn't fit me. 

The nickname doesn't seem like a big deal, but I feel like she is more excited by the idea of me than the actual me. She had signed up for the Army and shortly before she went to boot camp she sent me an engraved item with Love Jane on it. We have never met IRL and I have explained to her that it's important for me to meet her and see if we have any chemistry in person (and also to be able to get a read on her body language and relationships with others since red flags are so easy to hide online). I directly told her she was moving way to fast, and while I had agreed not to date anyone else while she was in boot and had taken down my OKC profile we were not seriously dating . In other words she had caught my interest and I wanted to meet her in order to see if we had something worth pursuing.

Once she was in boot we exchanged letters, although she didn't get a lot of mine at first because she originally gave me the wrong address. She had decided to not use her phone privileges to call me until halfway through when she told me she was being kicked out for a joke. We couldn't talk long, and the next day I got a letter that sort of explained more saying that she didn't get along with her battle buddy and the girl had turned her in for making a joke that ended up with her on suicide watch. The letter said the army pysch had diagnosed her as depressed and she could re enlist in 6 months if she got counseling.

She has refused to tell me what the joke was, and blames everything on the other girl and the other people in her platoon, saying that they are all assholes etc. When I talked to her a week later she mentioned that she had punched walls in anger on 5 different occasions, and damaged her hand. Also more about how much she hates the other people in boot, and how much it sucks that they won't let her play with guns or explosive ordinance. When I asked her if she was going to counseling she said she was just going to do the minimum to get back into the Armed Forces. Oh and the last letter I received she talks about how she has fallen in love with me .

Lastly, my recovery from surgery has taken a long time (spinal surgery) and one of the only ways I can exercise at the moment is walking (I can't twist my spine). I go on long hikes, and due to some phone issues I have been taking it with me but turning it off so my battery won't die. She was randomly getting phone privileges (I guess during times when the rest of the platoon were doing things with weapons she wasn't allowed) and calling repeatedly and texting during times when I couldn't answer. So the other night I turn my phone back on to a string of texts that go into things like you must be mad at me I guess all I have now is the army its true what they say you go in together and come out alone and this long gem:

At this point all I can do is just focus on fighting to stay in the army. Only thing I've got left at this point, I'm not going home any time soon. I'm done hoping. Hope is a dangerous thing. Hope can drive a man mad. And it's tearing me apart. As they always say you may come in the army in a relationship but you will leave single. Trackin.

My text back was pretty curt, just saying my phone had been off and wtf why is she all over the place and just basically that I hadn't been pissed at her but the last text did piss me off. No response until about an hour ago when her response is hay nickname_I_hate. whats up?

So /r/relationships my question is this, what is the best way to break things off? There are way to many red flags for me to ever be comfortable with this relationship, so i know that ending things is the way to go and will be best for both of us, but how? Should I right a letter, or wait for her to call? Or since she is supposed to get home in a week or so should I wait and do it then. Should I tell her some of the things that made me uncomfortable or should I just leave it at irreconcilable differences? And as for stuff she has sent me, like a shirt with special meaning to her, should I send it back?


---   
**tl;dr**: Met chick online who got very clingy, she joined the army got clingier, got put in suicide watch and just in general sounds like an antisocial mess with anger issues. I need advice on breaking it to her that we are not going to work out and I am no longer interested in having a relationship with her (once we could meet IRL).

22097,Dating,25yhki,"Backstory: About a month ago, my long-time boyfriend [24/m] and I broke up. After a few weeks of dealing with my emotions and wallowing, I decided that it was time to put myself out there and check out Coffee Meets Bagel. I figured it would be a little less crazy than OkC (I tried it a few years ago and got crazy people and weird messages) and would let me meet new people. I work in IT and work primarily with men much older than myself, so online dating is really the only option to meet guys outside of bars and tech conferences. I felt ready to go on dates and meet new people, and started to really feel better.


After a week or so on CMB, I began texting with a guy who I matched with, we'll call him Al [25/m]. Al and I really clicked, found out we had common interests, and meshed unusually well even though we've never met. We set up a date to grab a beer this week and both talked about how excited we both were to finally meet each other in person. We also found that we have mutual friends, one who works with him at his company.


A few days ago, my ex showed up at my place and wanted to apologize for everything that happened in our breakup. I realized how much I've missed him over the past month and we agreed to work together to figure things out- that we still love each other and want to be together. I've been really happy about reconciling since I see a future with him- I realize also that the stresses of our lives were getting in the way of our relationship, and that they are things that can be worked out with both of us on the same page. 


I realized after the make-up with my ex that I needed to be open with Al about the situation at hand. Al and I had been texting pretty often- throughout the day for the few weeks since we started chatting. I texted him letting know that I wanted to maintain the spirit of honesty and apologized for the situation. He asked if I was still down to get a beer like we had planned, but I let him know that I thought that would be a little awkward considering the circumstances. I've since deactivated my Coffee Meets Bagel account.


Did I do the right thing here? I feel bad for letting this guy down, but then again, we never met in person. 


TL;DR: Reconciled with my ex, but I feel bad about letting this guy down that I've been chatting with for a few weeks.

22098,Infidelity,2lza10,"Approximately two months ago, I was browsing around one of the dating advice, self-improvement (also extremely misogynistic) subreddits. I occasionally scroll through to see the ridiculousness of what these guys have to say, and I ended up finding a post my boyfriend wrote on wanting to date hotter women. (He had a specific diet and exercise routine that he mentioned in one comment, and I recognized it.) I confronted him, told him if I wasn't hot enough for him then we didn't have to date, and he gave me a sob story about his ex saying she wasn't attracted to him anymore when they broke up, so he constantly considers ways to be more attractive because of that situation. I let it go, we made up, yada ya.

Fast forward two months, I find his new secret reddit by him submitting a very specific cooking advice request he and I were having a conversation about. He again is wondering how to date classy women, and recently made a comment (as to why he was on the shady subreddit) about how he not too long along asked out the hottest girl he knew and was denied. We've been dating for a year, and while I have no idea just how long not to long ago is, I really don't think it matters at this point. 

Basically, I don't know if it's even worth trying to work out again. He seems like he will keep getting sneakier and sneakier the more I confront him. I thought I loved him, but by his secret posts, it seems like I'm just a placeholder until he finds someone more attractive who will actually date him.

I suppose I should mention that I'm not unattractive by any means. I eat well, exercise regularly, take care of my skin religiously, plus I work, attend school, and have a decent amount of hobbies. I know that he wants to be attractive, but I already think he's attractive. I don't understand why he keeps doing sneaky things that are obviously hurting me and our relationship. Should I be looking at this from a different perspective? Is there any other way to look at it other than me being a convenience until he finds someone hotter?

We didn't kiss or anything but we started texting for 2 weeks or so writing really long essays until she decided to come to my house. She came to mine late 1 evening rather drunk and I was sober. We had discussed before that we weren't going to have sex until we were both completely comfortable with each other so I knew that was out of the question. We cuddled the whole night and during the night I kissed her on the lips and she went with it for a couple seconds but then pulled away and turned around and said this it to awkward. Also the whole night she kept all her clothes on and kept pulling her top up to make sure no cleavage was showing. She keeps snap chatting and anytime I bring up anything more than cuddling she just ignores the message and changes the topic. She's coming around again tomorrow to cuddle. I'm just a bit confused as she seems eager to sleep over and cuddle in my bed but not kiss me? I find it a little strange. Have I been friend zoned and is she using me as some sort of cuddle buddy or is she just shy? I honestly don't mind and I am not in any rush to do anything, I just want to know what why she's being so cautious. She's had a boyfriend before and she isn't a shy person so I'm confused.

22105,Dating,2ooa3b,"So, me and my ex were together for a long time. We met in January last year and began dating a month after meeting. In November, our relationship broke down and we split up. She was my first long term/real girlfriend and I truly loved her for the most part of our relationship (towards the end, I don't know if I would call it love).

Since I started college (UK college), I made a few friends, one of which quickly became a very good friend, lets call her Lilly. Now, it was obvious to me and my friends that Lilly liked me from day one (she was anything but subtle). Lately, since the breakup, she has been a lot more flirty, hugging me a lot more (out of character), making more dirty jokes and making a considerably larger amount of eye contact with me (to the point where my friend mentioned it to me after the event).

I had a party last week which Lilly attended, a typical teenage party (lots of alcohol) and, while drunk, we were listening to cheesy pop punk and the likes when she hugged me out of the blue. We were both pretty drunk so we were giggling a lot of the time but she kept pushing harder into me. Then we curled up on the sofa together for over an hour.

Ever since this, I am starting to have feelings for her. Hugging her felt like hugging my ex, the same intimacy and closeness. I am just wondering how long I should wait? The last thing I want is to be rude to my ex, we had a mostly good relationship and I have nothing against her but I really want to be with Lilly and I know she wants to be with me (she has said it to many of my friends). Me and my ex have ceased contact entirely and there is no way she could find out about me and Lilly but I feel guilty for liking another girl. Any advice is welcome.

22111,Breakups,36os9l,"I had a great relationship with this girl for about a year. She was always plagued with emotional issues, though. But for the sake of our relationship I didn't judge her and always tried to help her through it. We've had our fair share of disagreements and arguments but we always reconciled.

Three weeks ago, however, I was swamped with work and had to continually cancel our plans together. Even though I told her that I missed her and that once work was over I will finally have more time for her. At first she seemed just fine, but the next day she lost it. She told me to forget about our upcoming dinner date. I was pretty upset at this, because I was trying my best to balance work and relationships and even told her as much. Come the dinner date, I went home instead, only to receive a text from her saying Why don't you care about me?. 

At this point, I got frustrated because I don't like playing these kinds of games. We talked for a bit but I ultimately stopped responding because we were going in circles. She didn't text me for a week and I didn't text her. By the end of the next week, I finally messaged her stating that I always tried my hardest to be there for her. I helped her through suicide watch; I paid for groceries when she couldn't afford food; helped her find a new apartment; and even helped with her medical bills. Granted, I didn't do any of these things because I expected something in return, I did them because they were the right thing to do. But in that same vein, the relationship had always been me giving, and when it was time for her to do the same, she couldn't seem to handle it. I told her that I was dissapointed that she would torpedo our relationship after only week in which I couldn't constantly be at her side. She never responded back.

Weeks past and I try to get in touch with her, but I get absolutely nothing in response. I call, text, email, etc. Nothing. I got so frustrated that earlier today I decided to knock on her door and finally get an answer. She opened the door -- she looked rather distressed and pale. She was certainly upset though I couldn't tell if that was brought upon by something else or simply by the sight of me. I asked her to talk with me and she said no. I asked her to explain why she was doing this, and she said no. She just kept repeating no, over and over. She said no more times than I asked questions! Now, at this point, you may be confused as to why I've gone this far to reach her. But this is a girl who not but a few months ago told me she loved me. Not a week ago told me that she could never forget me. And I have told her the same thing.

I was calm the entire time and simply told her that if she would but explain what was going on then I would leave her be. She replied with a no and told me to leave before she called the cops. In our year-long relationship I have never seen her act this way. I walked away and have resigned to the end of our relationship, even though I still have no clue what the hell is going on.

So I'm confused and dumbfounded. Even if she was truly upset with me, why not explain it and be done with it? Why refuse to even have a conversation? I have no clue what's going on in her head. 

I have no choice but to move on, and it's probably for the best. Still, I don't know what to do with all this frustration and confusion.

I'm new here and this is my first post so please bare with me 

So here we go. I started dating this guy I met online in the middle of September. We hit it off really well, and both commented early on how it easy it was to hang out and talk to one another. We both had similar situations (both fresh out of 6 year relationships) and neither of us were ready for anything serious. That being said, as time went on I felt like I was getting more attached and he seemed unwilling to take the relationship to the next level. Around late October I decided to reactivate my online dating profile as I felt like things were going nowhere with him, regardless of how much we seemed to love to be around each other. Clearly I had misunderstood his intentions though, as his friend told him about my online profile and after a 2 hour tearful text conversation (he refused to answer my calls) we decided we would just be friends. Fast forward to now, we are just friends but do everything a couple does. He even asked me to be his roommate in his new place but I declined which now I regret as it was a really nice place and we get along so well, but what can you do. Anyway, I began to notice different things about him that made me think he might want to change our friendship status. He started cuddling me again when we were together, holding my hand in public, and kissing me every time I came over or left. We have also remained intimate since we started dating. We had before labelled the relationship as FWB, but it was clear that wasn't really true as we did things mostly that couples do. Sometimes he would ask me to sleepover just to sleep, and he would hold my hand all night and stroke my hair... I'm not an expert on FWB but I don't think that's how it's supposed to work.

Anyway, I recently began trying to date someone else as I was clearly developing strong feelings for him and he made it clear that he didn't want a relationship with me. Which was very confusing though because he acted like we were in one. That aside, I decided to make plans with this other guy over the weekend and I think in an effort to make me jealous or get back at me he (the original guy) decided to go on a ski trip with another girl who he's just friends with, saying it was ok because she has a boyfriend. I took this as the last straw, and told him if he went, our FWB relationship would be over and we would only be just friends. Long story short, he went, but texted me the entire time saying he regretted it and wished he had spent the weekend with me instead and how sad he was that our relationship was changing. I got upset with this and flat out asked him if he had feelings for me. He said of course he did but that he didn't want a relationship. That made me angry, so I told him this was goodbye as I was starting to have strong feelings and was even starting to fall in love with him. 

That being said, I miss him and wonder if I should try and make things work as a traditional friendship with boundaries (i.e., no cuddling, kissing, etc.) as it is hard to find people that care about you and I feel he is one of them. Plus I truly enjoy his company and we have so many things in common and shared interests. I don't know, I guess I'm just confused as to what I should do. I know the absence of this relationship will be painful, as we used to spend almost every day together. Any advice as to how I should proceed?

So just a few days ago my girlfriend of about 3 years broke up with me. We've had such an awesome relationship but I guess I should have seen it coming. For quite awhile now she has complained that something was missing but I didn't know what it was, I feel awful I couldn't fix it. We had our little arguments, but one in particular over and over it seems. I don't think she could do it anymore and I don't blame her.

Anyways, so now shes off on vacation with her bff (and others?) at the beach. I got a message 2 days ago from her saying that she wasn't totally giving up on us yet, that she just needed some time. This is somewhat comforting but im afraid her friend is going to persuade her to do otherwise. She (her bff) just broke up with her bf too and i think she just wants someone to party and whatnot with. I like her friend and all but I just don't think she has our relationship in best interest or cares what happens to it. She (her bff) had, just a few days before the breakup, asked her to come live with her in a far away state in a few months just a week before we were supposed to move into our new apartment. And she was seriously considering it :/

Everyone tells me to give up and move on, that everything happens for a reason, yada, yada. But im not ready to move on, I need to win her back. I know were meant to be together, she is my best friend! I understand that she may need some time to focus on herself, and hey maybe I do too. Im all for giving her space and time out of respect.

Ive already been honest with her and told her I still care and that I hope everything works out for her. She says the same to me.

Im sorry, I guess im not totally sure what I want to ask here, as im still quite flustered from the breakup. I guess im just looking for advice to cope and wait it out? What can I do to make myself feel better, I don't think I've ever felt this awful before, its so new to me. What can I do to support her without making it harder on her too? Any advice is appreciated!

Thank you all

22136,Dating,287ji6,"Ok guys, you already know about me and Kaori, the girl I like, if you've read my previous posts about our relationship.

It all started becoming weird last wednesday. I was at my last day on college when she sent me a message asking if we could spend the night together talking thru Skype. I couldn't reply her because I had a very weak internet signal, so when I got home I replied her, but she never logged on for the remainder of the day.

She replied me the next day, saying she got a headache and she fell asleep, which was OK with me. However since then she seems to be avoiding me in some way or another. Tho she's online on her cellphone and sometimes likes what others say, she pretty much doesn't reads my messages until I write her AGAIN, then we start talking and out of the blue she stops reading my messages and she either replies WAAAY later or I have to engage her on conversation AGAIN.

When we talk tho, she acts as usual and pretty much says how she likes spending time with me only to show completely the opposite thing.

Like, this friday I said Hi to her to which she pretty much said Can't talk right now, I'm bussy and well, I just let her like that. Later that night she writes me saying Sorry, she was watching soccer with friends and told me she wasn't bussy anymre. So we start talking about the match, we had a very nice while like... 10 minutes of conversation. When I asked her about sports I told her I like to skate, and she was like Wow! That's cool!!! I really like how you're a man that seems to make a lot of efforts, I asked her if she liked skating too and she hasn't read the message yet, even if she spent online another 30 minutes in which she didn't did anything on her facebook.

Well, she's been getting online and my message is still unread, I've asked people for advice and this is what they think...

**My ex's sister (a very good friend) said:** That she's pretty sure this Kaori girl actually likes me, but that she must be a very active or bussy and forgetful lady, and I should trying to talk to her JUST once every few days.

**A friend who supposedly knows about japanese culture said:** Japanese women are hard to get to and they like guys to pretty much be insisting on them. If she's ignoring me she pretty much wants to see how far I'm able to go to talk to her.

**My mother said:** That she's a b***h and I should be as mean as she is and forget about her.

**A friend who studies psychology said:** That she might just be kind with me for the lulz and I should ignore her.

So, what do you think?

22143,Breakups,1mm3vc,"Back up: Throughout high school, I've had many things with several guys.  I found myself sending pictures and explicit texts to guys just to feel like I was pretty or wanted.  I regretted it every time.  


Senior year:  This guy (m 17 at the time) and I had become best friends and I loved hanging out with him.  He was a junior, I was a senior.  For a few weeks, I had been having another “thing” with a family friend who was in college and I had always thought was reallly hot.  But I started to realize how amazing my best friend was and quickly broke thigs off with the other guy.  A couple of weeks later (October), my best friend asked me to be his girlfriend.  It was perfect for several months.  He knew about all my past and still loved me, and he told me all about his old girlfriends and how terrible they were.  He took my virginity.  And eventually had sex all the time.  He told me i was beautiful, perfect, etc. Made me feel like a princess.


He started to be very jealous of my guy friends and forced me to get rid of them, although he talked to girls all the time.  Even one he’d had a crush on for a really long time.


During spring break, I went on college visits with my mom.  He broke into my facebook and read my messages.  He freaked out and messaged the guys. 


Since then, he became very angry, unpredictable, and abusive.  He constantly accused me of cheating, called me a slut, and repeatedly grabbed me out of anger leaving bruises on my arms and legs.  During the summer, without warning, he even sent my mom all the stuff I had done before, including screenshots from the facebook I deleted in March.  He always yelled at me for the “skank” I used to be, and made me feel really alone, disgusting, and misunderstood.


I have never given him a reason to doubt my faithfulness to him, and always did what he asked.  For a long time I hoped he would go back to who he used to b. He often apologized and promised me things would be different.  They never were. 


Finally I moved to university in California, leaving him in Texas.  After screwing up again and again, I told him I didn’t love him anymore.  He tells me not to break up with him so he can fix things and that everything will be better.  I believe him.  Find out he is trying to get into my old email.  Get mad.  Later see that he has upvoted really inappropriate pictures of girls on his reedit.  He admits to me, after 11 months, that he has had a bad sexual addiction since he was young. (This upsets me, because of how bad he made me feel for my mistakes.  I would have definitely done my best to help him.  He kows that.)


Later see that is is attached to an email I don’t know.  I’VE NEVER SNOOPED IN ANY OF HIS STUFF, AND I NEVER WILL AGAIN. I was just so mad that he doesn’t trust me to do anything right.  Find out he’s been messaging girls on his YouTube.  Also he has a textfree app where he calls and texts girls back in MAY for sex when we were still very much in love. ALSO find out that he has a fake facebook where he is possing as a freshman at my university and flirting with girls and calling them beautiful (which is kind of a huge deal, since my boyfriend knew I was sometimes sensitive about the way I look).


He has always said he hates liars and cheaters, and he’s accused me of cheating for months.  He’s been apologizing for several days now.  I have finally officially broken up with him and tell him to stop talking to me all the time.  When he gets angry, he blames me for him messaging other girls, because he was looking for “attention” I didn’t give him.  He still tells me he loves me everyday.  He wants to come to California for school next year also.  


I’m heart broken.  He was my best friend, and for a while, he was the love of my life.  I told him things that I’ve never told anyone, and gave him things I’ll never give to anyone else.  This was my first real relationship, and I’m not a very strong person. Obviously.  I'm not sure how to admit this to anyone because of how ashamed i am of myself for staying with him so long.  I’m four states away from home with no close friends to talk to, how do I deal with this and make sure it never happens again?

After realizing that the plethora of red flags that I was noticing over the two months of dating this person were indeed indicative of one severely deranged and unhealthy individual, I politely, firmly, and definitively told her that things weren't going to work out.

First, she had a temper tantrum, locked herself in my bathroom, sent a barrage of lovey-dovey texts, followed by a series of texts indicating that she was going to hurt herself. (She emerged with scratches on one of her wrists.)

Then, once things calmed down, I repeated that things weren't going to work out, citing the above incident as one of many reasons why, and she ran out and got a tattoo of our initials on her scratched-up wrist.

Finally, I get her out of my place, and cut off all communication - for twelve hours, until she texts me saying that she's pregnant. I 99.99% knew that she was lying, but I played along for about 20 minutes until she became verbally abusive about our relationship, and tried to scare me with threats to keep the baby.

I later found out that she told other people, including friends of mine and her parents that she's pregnant.

About two weeks later, she texts me saying that she got an abortion. When I press her for proof, she disappears for a while, and then sends me an obviously forged pregnancy test result document from her OBGYN, as well as  forged post abortion exam paperwork.

Then she rails on me for how horrible I am, but says that we should try to work things out.

At which point I, again, cut off all communication.

But she continues to harass me with pathetic lovey-dovey texts, or creepy, bitter, mean ones.

Do I maintain radio silence and keep my knowledge/proof of her forgery in my back pocket for a rainy day, report her to her OBGYN / authorities, or is there another option I haven't considered.

22156,Dating,1t99bq,"Hey everyone. Long time lurker, second time poster. I'll try to keep this as short and simple as possible.

There is a guy that I met through a temp work position at a college near where I live. We hit it off from the very start. I was literally IN LOVE with him. It was love at first sight, for sure. We went out one night, and long story short, I ended up breaking my leg and we didn't really talk after that for a couple of weeks.

He tried really hard to get back into my life (kept texting me, etc...) and I started talking to him again. So, we hung out, I went to his basketball games, and eventually we had sex one time.

Now, this is where I hold some blame for the situation, even though deep down, I don't really feel like I did anything wrong. I was really feeling this guy. We had good chemistry in every way and I'm thinking that I want him to be my boyfriend. So, I tell him. He basically says that he likes me and all but he's not ready. Ok, no problem. I say all I can do is be patient. Then, he starts acting distant and flat out ignores me for an entire week (but types of twitter some things that are directed towards me in a negative way. I should say here that he doesn't know I know his twitter name and I've seen some thing that make me irritated, but anyways.).

* **EDIT** * So I should add here that we were acting like a couple without actually saying we were together. He called me baby and said that I was his and nobody else's so I got the impression that he wanted a relationship. Guess I was wrong.

So, I sulk, I cry, I delete his number because obviously he's not interested. He broke my heart. Then, of course when I am finally getting over it, he texts me. Hey. That's all he says. I write him back this extremely long text that basically says Don't text me again, you were rude to me, you don't deserve my attention, etc.... I block his phone number and move on.

Recently, somehow a text from him STILL got through and he sent me a screenshot of something on twitter about his astrological sign that says We can't be rushed into a relationship. You must be patient with us. It will be worth it in the long run.

OK???? What does this have to do with him ignoring me for an entire week, claiming he lost his phone but also saying that I told him I was gonna give him space (no, I definitely did not.).

My questions is... what the hell does he want now? Why can't he just leave me alone? I really care(d) for this guy, but he showed his true colors when he lied and ignored me.

Should I tell him off? Should I try to make friends? I just don't know. I want to get over him, but there's always the fear that I won't find someone else who likes me.

So, my girlfriend and I just moved in together and curiosity took the better of me and I read her text messages. I found out that she had a dream about an old friend of his about 5 months ago, and she contacted him. They flirted a little bit in text, and that's it.
Then she discussed it with another friend of hers and she decided not to text him again.


Now, about 3-4 weeks ago, while my girlfriend and I were on holiday, this guy contacted her and they flirted a little bit again, nothing serious though. Btw, I don't think he knew we were on holiday, he might not even know about me, as far as I know this is the only contact they had in 6 months. I think they might have had a thing for each other even before I met her but I think that nothing happened between them.


This guys lives in another town, and we moved to yet another town. I moved here 2 weeks ago, and my girlfriend just came after me.

The first weekend my girlfriend was alone, they chatted again, flirting got a bit more serious, nothing explicit though. The guy said that the week after he would be in the same town as my girlfriend so they agreed to meet.

My girlfriend discussed this again with her other friend, she told her that they would meet, but nothing could happen between them.

Then the day came when they were supposed to meet, they were both out partying separately, but they did not meet in the end.

So, this is where we are now and I'm not sure what to do. I feel bad for reading her messages but I also feel bad that she's flirting with another guy. Is this something I should be worried about or is this just some meaningless flirting. Should I talk to her about it?  They are probably not gonna see each other for quite a while, but I don't like the thought that she's thinking about another guy.

we have dated for 2 months and been together for 5 weeks now and she is very affectionate towards me, always holding my hand in public, holding me by the waist or pants, initiating kisses, caressing my arms when we stand and wait by traffic lights and expressing her love in spending tremendous amount of her time with me, surprising me with gifts etc. She was at my place several times, i am visiting her and staying at her place for a few days next week, she introduced me to her friends and we are going on a beach holidays together (her, me and another couple, her friends). 

However, she is openly looking at other men. For example, she watched live football game on the stadium and told me about a handsome player who she watched and cheered for during the game. She told me that uniform turns her on (police) and how she couldn't take her eyes of riot police officers standing there. If she goes out partying, she tells me afterward if there was or wasn't anyone attractive to rest her eyes on. There was a 3vs3 basketball tournament and she was almost like lets go check out the guys - and she stood there, watched the game and all the players, caressed my arm and held hands, concluded there was none worth seeing and then moved on.

Life was good, we were comfortable together. We could both be weird and do weird things with each other and not be judged. We'd go out with friends, we'd stay in with friends, and we'd stay in together.

But, about 3 or so months ago life came crashing down on me, I got depressed. I didn't handle it right at all. I started being mean/irrational/very insecure at times. I'd talk to her about it, but sometimes I got kind of mean, like if she went out with her friends after asking me, maybe the following day I would tell her I actually didn't like that. This happened a bunch of times. It seemed like one week would be awesome, then the next something would happen. I also began to isolate myself from everyone/everything. Everyone knew something was up and that I wasn't okay. She tried to tell me to see someone, she has experience with this and takes medication for it, I told her no and I would be okay in a few weeks, that this happens sometimes and I get better. I told her remember how fun I used to be, and ask my friends how fun I was before you. I didn't get better, I got worse. The pressure of life became too much and I didn't have the help I needed.

It all came to a tipping point this past weekend. She had invited my over to sleep at her place and hang with her friends, something we hadn't done before because it's a dorm, but we had agreed to do in the future because she wanted to. She ended up going out with her friends though because one of them is going through some stuff and the three of them are a group. I got mad about this as I had in the past because I now ended up spending the night alone by myself since I have isolated myself from everyone. I told her this when she came over the following day for a little party, she understood, but just the way I went about wasn't nice, I made it seem like her fault and that she didn't care about me, I made her cry, not the first time I have to admit. 

She and my friends went out for dinner/margs, I didn't go because I was in that sort of mood that day. But while they were gone, I was like, hey, a great idea right now would be for me to get drunk, I can be fun and make it up to her and everyone else. I did that, she came back, said I looked nice, everything was happy.

Then, she went downstairs. I went to the window to look at the guests arriving, and as I turned around, I spat on her clothes on the ground, not a lot, but just once, I do it when I'm drunk to not throw up. I don't know why I did it then, maybe I thought it was a sign of affection in some primal way (it's really just disrespectful) or it'd be funny, I don't know. I went downstairs, saw her, we smiled, exchanged some words about how she was glad I was here, and then I told her what I did. I didn't think it'd be a big deal, it was, I should of waited until the morning.

She went upstairs, I came after her to explain how I was stupid, didn't mean anything, and was sorry. She wasn't having it, I had broken her. A lot of stuff from our past arguments came up, and a lot of dumb stuff by me was said. The worst part is she said she didn't want to talk about this stuff drunk, she didn't want to wake up w/o a boyfriend after all of this too. I didn't listen. 

She then decided to leave, I said good idea. One of our mutual friends pulled her into a room to talk, while they were in there I was talking to a mutual, he asked what was going on, I stupidly said she is just being a cunt. She had heard me. I chased after her all night, biked to campus, tried calling/texting, but she wouldn't budge.

We got met up and got lunch the next day, and that's when she broke up with me. I pleaded, I cried, said I'm sorry, and everything else you can think of. Somehow, she agreed to a lunch on Tuesday to see if any of us had changed, let time for the emotions to calm before making a decision like this.

In the meantime, I began the change. I went to my university counseling, and started the trip of getting help. Just the first meeting and the pack of info they gave me had so much in it, so much stuff I wish I had hear 3 months ago. This all would of been avoidable.

Tuesday came. Begged/pleaded, but she said no. I said I'd get better and was on the track, she said it's going to take me time, I agree, but wanted her there too. But still wouldn't come back. She said how she wanted to experience college without being committed. The worst part about it though, is we're each other's best friend. Neither of us wanted to quit cold turkey. But decided it was the best way. So, we said goodbye, hugged, and that was it. 

Part of me is hoping in a month or so when school is done and I've gotten some help we can get back together. But I can't say what'll happen during that time. All I know is I'm dying to have her back. Dying to send her a text message asking to be friends and still see each other. It's just so hard.

I know I need to fix myself. Hang out with my friends more and be more like the version of myself that has fun and enjoys life. I need to figure out college/life plans and be content with where things are. Things were starting to get better with us, we were going to the gym together and being supportive in any way possible. I don't have that anymore, so getting better will be harder. I told my parents and friends my story, and they're all here. So. It's time to figure out what to do and how to get better and if she'll come back and how to just handle all of this stuff.

The worst part is just knowing that everything she said makes sense. She deserves better. She deserves her own college experience.

My question though, does anyone have any advice? Doesn't have to be super specific. I know I was terrible to her. Can I get her back? What would you do?

We started chatting a few weeks after I sent her an initial 'Hi, I'm Aphaianine!' message and added her, and from that moment we just didn't stop texting. She told me she thought I was cute and it just went from there.


I really hope the following isn't too confusing but here we go ...


We've met a couple of times now but I started feeling like she was pulling away from me a bit. I sent her a message and said: 'Hey, I feel like you have been pulling away from me lately. I just wanted to let you know I'm going to give you a bit of space and if you want to hang out/chat someone soon I'd be more than happy to - just let me know. You know I only want you to be happy :)'. 


She freaked out and said she didn't realise she'd been a bit more distant and she didn't want me thinking that she 'sucked'. I told her she'd need to trust me and she said 'I'm sorry, I'll leave you alone and give you space'. At this point I was freaking out because it seemed like she'd misread my texts. I told her that's not what I meant and overexplained myself maybe a few too many times ... I'll admit I made a mistake. I said that if she was unsure or scared I'd give her time. Then she came back and said she was confused because it seemed like one moment I wanted to be friends, next minute I wanted more and she thought that I was going to give her space - I didn't give her that 'space' because it seemed like she didn't want it! I told her I'd make my intentions clear and asked her if she wanted to go out to dinner with me on a proper date. I got 'this is so intense' as a reply.


I apologised for the intensity and explained it wasn't my intention to put pressure on her. She didn't reply, but she followed up a few hours later apologising if I was upset and asking if I was okay.


Well, yesterday morning I said 'So should I keep talking to you or should I back off?' to which she replied with 'It wasn't meant to be like this, all this pressure to make us work, but it seems like that's all there is.' She then mentioned she saw my latest Facebook status about being home sick and she started making sure I was okay, what was wrong, etc. She later asked me how I was doing and we had a short text 'conversation' about me being sick and that was that. 


I'm just so confused! Today I texted 'hey' in the morning and she started launching into a big explanation/discussion about how she wanted to buy a car but needs to borrow money from her dad and she hates doing that. It's like she wants to keep talking to me and carry on conversations but I just don't know if she's completely over her freakout or what. I'll admit I probably sent her too many texts in too short a space of time but I was desperate to explain to her that I wasn't 'unsure' about us or anything. 


My question is, what is the best way to recover from this? I feel like I still have some sort of chance because she's still talking to me fairly normally, however she never said yes or no to going on a dinner date with me so I don't know what she's thinking. I'm reluctant to ask her her thoughts over text because texting is a terrible format for serious discussions, but how do I get her to see me again? She never accepted or declined my invitation to dinner so I can't tell her thoughts on that.


Any help is appreciated. I really like this girl and I need to know the best course of action because I really suck at this stuff :(.

This is more of an update from [a previous post I made] (http://rr.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2w3mot/my_girlfriend_20f_of_5_months_has_suddenly_become/) about my girlfriend of 5-6 months, who very recently became much more distant towards me, as if the relationship is a chore rather than something to be enjoyed. 

Follow-up from the last post, we met and decided to give it 2 weeks: If we still felt the same way then we'd consider breaking up. This meant that the dissertations would be all done by then and hopefully we can patch it up a bit. 

Following your advice I decided to give her some time to get some work done and hopefully relieve some stress: we all have dissertations due (although I had a 3 month extention due to bereavement), and hers was submitted on Thursday. I thought that she'd be more active now the big project's over, but no such luck. 

I spent the night at hers last night and it didn't go well. I told myself that I was going to be more honest about my feelings last night, and quite frankly, it was just like Valentine's Day all over again: lack of effort on her part, no intimacy except what she wants, and I told her I love her, like I had done before many times and got a similar response. Her response however was pretty different: she just smiled and said Yeah, to which I said, pretty pissed off:

- Ok, how about I say it again and you put a bit more effort into it?

I admit, that was a dickish thing to say, I don't need reminding of that, but frankly, that was how I was feeling at the time, I told her how I was annoyed at her lack of effort and if she honestly wants to be in this relationship. I decided to be brutally honest and just flat-out ask her if she still loves me, to which she said I don't know anymore. She seemed to give vague reasons as to why she's feeling like this, such as It's fizzled out, or Perhaps we jumped in too quickly?, which I just don't understand.

The rest of the night was pretty emotional, crying on both parts, awkward silences, but I left her place this morning and we seemed to have worked things out a little bit, but this is honestly doing my head in.

22184,Breakups,286ant,"Background: girl I met freshman year at Georgia tech, became friends, then during my sophomore year started dating, had sex immediately, but have been having problems for about the last year. The sex is normally fine, sometimes it's not but whatever, it won't always be great, but she's not okay with it not being perfect. She's also super worried about the future and marriage and all kinds of stuff while I care more about graduating and getting a nice job, and just enjoying college life while I still can! 

This kinda hits at the bigger problems we're having that she's jealous of how well I'm doing in school, and of co-workers that I talk to at lunch (summer job), and she's not happy with where she is in life and kinda relies on me for her own happiness. She's working a dead end job in her hometown in south Carolina with a 2.9 while I'm at a big engineering company with a 3.9 at school. I'm doing what I want to do and she is Hell bent on getting a doctorate, which I'm almost sure isn't going to happen because she's just not cuttout for it :(

Anyway on to the problem, I am in this relationship for a fun time with someone I care about. She's in it to find the man she wants to marry and have kids and retire and all that with. I play video games a lot and she hates them. I'm a non confrontational atheist and she's Catholic. I do some sports and she's interested in them, but they're not a big enough piece of our lives to build our relationship out of. I am logical in my thoughts and she panics and gets angered by my suggestions when she's panicked. All in all, I feel like we have little in common but love and sex are what's keeping us together. 

We almost broke up once and I've let it drag on. I feel like our relationship is hopeless. Every day she expects me to text her at least three or four times and call at night or she flips shit. I don't even look forward to talking to her because our calls are just me saying I'm still enjoying my job and she still hates hers and the family situation is still very argumentative and essentially poor. I think I should break up with her but I don't know how and when and I want to make sure it's the right decision, as I do love hanging out with her and she's great to be around, but I don't feel like our relationship isnt working especially not over long distance this summer.

22188,Breakups,1oa590,"A little background into the relationship;

We started talking as friends over two years ago and only stayed occasional friends for a long time. I was in a long term relationship, she had recently broken up with her boyfriend, and we kept our distance accordingly. This however, developed into something more after a period of time and eventually our conversations became more flirtatious. To keep the story brief, I ended up leaving my long term relationship as it was on the rocks anyways, to be with this girl for whom I developed strong feelings for. She fell in love with me (she claims) and I did as well, and things were going great.

About 6 months into our relationship, she breaks it off with me as I was having trouble dealing with the life changes that came with ending a four year relationship, but only a couple of days later we ended up getting back together when I showed up at her house crying because of how sad I was. This re-ignited our relationship and things had been great.

However, a couple of days ago I notice her talking to a friend of her's from the UK, he's a musician who she's been friends with for a period of time I'm not really sure but I never thought too much about it. Unfortunately, it was not something I should've ignored. She started talking about this guy every day we spend time together (there's about an hour between us) and told me about long Skype conversations she's had with him. This initially aroused my suspicion but I felt that she would silly to fall for a guy that's so far away and she's known for such a long time. 

To add to the unusual behavior, she then approached me about studying abroad next semester, in the UK. Once again, I didn't really connect the dots but I told her that if it is really what she wants to do than I support her. Eventually, I noticed her becoming more protective of her phone, and her computer. I (ashamedly so) looked at her phone one night while she was asleep to find a large majority of her text messages deleted. The ones from myself and her mom were there, but texts from other people were either 80-90% deleted, or only the sent messages remained. This became a big red flag and my suspicion only grew.

I brought up this guy in conversation just to gauge her reaction and of course she was passe about it and said, Oh, we just talk on occasion about his music and my art and stuff, nothing serious. And the conversation would end there. Rather than assume the worst I kept forcing myself to believe her and just push my gut feelings of something bad down over and over again.

The last three days however, revealed something more sinister. On a semi-surprise visit on Tuesday, I noticed her talking to this guy while in bed together on her laptop and while I was reaching up to grab her around her waist I noticed the conversation she was having and I again ashamedly so, looked at the chat she was having. Her last sent message was Nighty night (Guy's Name) :-* and when she saw me snuggling up with her she closed her laptop and ended up snuggling back.

Throughout the next couple of days she became instantaneously distant. Her texts were sporadic and short, she didn't want to talk much over the phone, and her I love you's became more infrequent. I noticed it but rather than make it a huge deal I just tried to match her communications so as not to pressure her.

Tonight however, it all came crashing down. I went to her place where she Left work early because she was sick and asked me to let her know when I was close. She honestly acted like she didn't want me to come over because she kept repeating things like I don't want you to get sick and I really don't feel like doing anything So when I got there she started acting like she was already feeling better. She ended up hopping in the shower and I sat on her bed and watched netflix on her laptop, I noticed that she had taken the time to delete her entire facebook message with this guy. My alarms were ringing loud at this point.

We ended up going out and her actions became more clear as time went on, she would barely hold my hand, she didn't kiss but only one time, and only introduced me to a couple of people. After a short time at the bar we headed back to her place and during our conversations the guy came up again, which I shrugged off. Then she asked me how long I was intending on staying, which caught me off guard. I told her that I was planning on leaving Sunday morning and at which point she said What are you going to do tomorrow while I'm at work? I had plenty of homework to do so my intention was to complete it while she was working. Out of the blue she then tells me that she's going to be taking her laptop with her so she can do some sketches on lunch (She works at a place that rhymes with Ball-Mart) which was something she has never done before in the whole time that she's worked there.

After a while, I began to put the pieces together and I realized that our relationship was over. The final piece of the puzzle was put into place when she asked me if it was okay if we didn't have sex. The entire time she and I had been together, and even before we were officially dating, she had never turned down sex, and in fact instigated it a majority of the time. This is how I knew for sure. I told her that was fine and we laid in bed together and she fell asleep. I of course could barely sleep and after dwelling on it for a couple of hours, I decided to pack my things up and head home.

So here I am, laying in my own bed, while I am sad the relationship ended, I can't help but think that I'm better off without her, as she obviously did not want to continue the relationship but didn't know how to end it. So I took the initiative on this one. I still wonder if she is going to call me in the morning when she wakes up for work, maybe I'll post about it later.

TL;DR - Girlfriend having emotional affair, changed rapidly, I figured it out and left early this morning.

Feels good to get that all out.

**I actually had a chance to speak with the UK guy and my fears were confirmed (emotional affair), with an interesting caveat. As it turns out, the guy had no idea that we were even together, apparently all he was told was that I was a friend of hers that liked her alot but that we weren't together. I'm not sure if I should believe him or not but he has been swearing up and down that he had no clue. This really only validates what I had already known. Guess I made the right choice. I'm sure she'll call when she wakes up.**

**[Update 8:05am CST]**

**I just got off the phone with my ex. It was a long conversation not surprisingly. She told me that she was confused by her feelings for me and got scared when she thought that I would want to maybe get engaged in the future and got lost in the fear. She does have a body image problem so I understand why she had such bad self-esteem. She did say that she loved me, I never asked if she still loves me but that's a moot point. She is going to talk to the guy from the UK and I told her that I am not going to be engaging her in conversation for a very long time. If she wants to talk to me she is capable of reaching out to me.**

I truly loved this girl, and I still do, I know in my heart that my love won't disappear in a day, and may never fade away, this girl I think was the first girl that I felt like I had a deep affectionate love for.

I sincerely appreciate all of your helpful words of support. I think it might be best for me to sleep at least a little bit today, and maybe I can start the healing process soon.

22193,Dating,1o0wye,"Hi. I met a girl several months ago at College on an academic fieldtrip where we went abroad with our course for a week. We got on while we were there, but when we arrived back home neither of us spoke to each other for a while.

A few days later she started speaking to me and we really began to hit it off. It got to the stage where we were speaking almost all the time, whether it was by text or by Facebook or face-to-face, and one day we got onto the topic of relationships with a mutual friend. I found out that she was not looking for anything, and neither was I, so I thought nothing of it. 

We began to speak less and less over time, and more recently we've been speaking once every few days; a quick text here or there. Earlier on she text me and we got onto the conversation of our plans for the evening. This is when she told me she was going to a guy's house who she was romantically interested in. I was happy to hear this because I love her as a friend and I truly want the best for her, but I can't help but feel a sickening feeling in my stomach, and I can't put my finger on it. 

I think I've fallen for her, as hard as I tried not to, and I'm feeling pretty shitty at the moment. I don't take it personally that she likes this guy and I'm happy things are going well for her. My emotions were all over the place about this. I just wish I told her when I had the chance about my feelings for her. I don't know whether I should be cutting contact with her or being there as one of her best friends and supporting everything she does. I love her too much as a friend just to cut everything. I'm feeling so conflicted and need help with what to do. Thanks

22195,Dating,2ad2dj,"Me and her have known each other for 6 or 7 years. Mutual friends, and casual acquaintances at best. Never really got to know her, but there's a great reason for that...

super short version: is that my (then) girlfriend made up a slew of lies about my current one, and caused us to separate, even as acquaintances. Well years later, we reunited, cleared the air, and both realized how much of a liar and psychopath/sociopath the ex is/was. this was in October. She also broke up with her boyfriend around Halloween. We basically have spent every day together since. 

I did set the rules early and followed them. My problem is I set the barriers too high, and now that the feelings are out there (I told her), our relationship is not where either one of us want it to be-but probably for different reasons.

I told her after a VERY romantic evening in March, that I had strong feelings for her. But I valued her as a person and my best friend much more than wanting to sleep with her right then. She wanted to have sex, and I didn't. Well I did, but not under those circumstances. She accepted that, but also didn't reciprocate my sentiment. Things did not change between us, and we continued to hang out daily, laugh a lot, get drunk together, and generally bond on a daily basis.

2 months later, I brought it up again. It didn't go so well this time. Probably my fault? I said something like I'm really falling in love with you. And it can be stupid to fall for someone who doesn't feel the same way. I wish I could take that one back, because I think what I did is inadvertently call her stupid. 

We didn't talk for a few days, but when I finally did get a chance to speak to her I apologized if I had made her feel dumb. I told her I was just a regular guy who found a great girl and was having a hard time dealing with it all. Her words at that time were the more you say you love me, the more I'll pull away. We should do our own thing for a while and see what happens.

I was really kind of crushed by that. But the next day, she hit me up, and we started to work towards becoming normal again. Normal in the sense that we could hang out and laugh and be together without some tension. It's basically been like that ever since, but I feel like we are getting more and more involved. I DO love her, but from an empathetic sense, I suspect she wonders WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK after I haven't really engaged her physically since October. I get a hug from her when she leaves my house, but usually not any other time. Those hugs are the best fucking part of my day. When I get them.

I really want to be with her, and at face value, I have to see that her spending all of her time, and putting effort to see me (we live about 30min from each other, in different towns actually) is what it is. But what is it? I want to just jam my tongue down her throat and say something like sorry for taking so long , but how? I've been mindful of how great that evening in March was, and I think that we are both hoping for another chance for something like that. Natural.

The bigger issue at play here is my own 'baggage'. Ive already gone really long, but a short idea of why this is so hard for me: I was sexually active from 5years old to 11. Almost daily. heterosexual mostly, but by the time I was 10, I was so comfortable with sex that I was abused by a male peer as well.

At the age of 11 or 12, I made the choice to be celibate. I regressed from sexual behavior during puberty and my teens, and because of that, I know it has affected me as an adult.  In some good and bad ways. More recently, I haven't had sex in over a year-since last summer. I realized before the age of most, that having sex was actually REALLY easy. But the choice to have it was/is always hard for someone like me. I'm particular about my attractions, because  I've been shamed by my choices. I think I've worked hard at improving that damage from the abuse, but the thought of sex with a pretty girl makes me feel insecure. And in my life, I think the only thing I'm majorly insecure about is my sexlife. Shamed is probably more accurate.

I was so attracted to this girl that I knew if we slept together too early, it could ruin a great lifelong relationship. So hence, here I am. I believe she thinks I'm playing games, or un-interested in her physically, or worse, scared. Opening up to her and revealing the why seems like too much to disclose without being asked, or otherwise.

How can I find the peace of mind I want/need? I'm literally fine with taking it as slow as she wants, but maybe I lost my chance a while ago? Does she just see me as a pussy, who wants her bad, but is too scared to do anything about it, other than talk? Is being direct an option? Just kissing her and making her deal with it, since the feelings are already out there?

22196,Breakups,2wkefn,"I was in a relationship with my ex girlfriend of 6 months. We ended the relationship. I realized then I loved her but sadly the relationship was so bad that we didn't get back together, it was too late. She moved on and met another man online shortly thereafter. 

She was with this man for about three months until it became evident that he was married and was playing with her. I kept contact with her by email telling her that I loved her and missed her until finally one day after not reaching out for about two weeks she came to me telling me that she missed me. Then she told me that the relationship had ended.

I obviously still have feelings for her, so I allowed myself to see her again. We spent a weekend together, we had sex and everything seemed great. After that weekend she told me that she felt there was no spark anymore. I couldn't understand what she meant. After all we had sex. She said she didn't feel she could reciprocate my feelings of love. I decided to leave it alone.

About a month went by and on Valentine's day I decided to email her. I expressed to her that regardless what was going on in her life I wanted to wish her a happy Valentine's day and that I loved her. I also told her she did not need to respond the email. 

She then looked for me on facebook and thanked me for the email. I said you're welcome. She eventually started making conversation with me. I told her that talking to me would eventually lead to me being endearing to her and that if it bothered her she better stop talking. She said she didn't mind it. 

She then asked for pictures and started being very flirtatious, telling me I looked hot and that she still finds me sexy. I obviously got again to the point in which I said, well, then meet me, we can hang out. She said she wanted to be sure this time around.

But she kept going at it, being flirtatious, calling me sexy, asking for pictures. At some point our conversations became sexual again. 

Finally at some point I put a little bit of pressure and told her I wanted to see her. She then started to back off the next couple of days being more distant. Finally at some point she became rather nasty. 

I demanded an explanation for her behavior, I mean, she knows I have feelings then why not realize that the positive feedback gives me hope?. She wouldn't give me a straight up answer. I told her that if she only sees me as a friend then she should just say so and that it would help me understand her better. She still would hesitate on her answer. I pressured her on whether she was attracted to me, she kept saying that she was. That the physical attraction is not the problem but the problem is that she can't love me back as I do her.

Ultimately I am just posting this here because I need to understand her behavior. What is it exactly that she wants? Why is it that she seems so attracted to me but at the same time she is unable to give me a chance? If she truly means that she is attracted then why not allow us to spend time together?

22199,Breakups,20vobr,"Here's the lowdown of our relationship... I've known this guy for years - probably close to 10 years in fact. We've hooked up in the past several times, but we've never actually had a relationship before January of this year. But I myself have been in love with him since like August of last year.

He did some time in jail in January (drug related), and we were writing each other back and forth/calling each other, and as we got closer to his bond hearing he told me he loved me in a letter. Since I felt the same way, we tried having a relationship when I bailed him out of jail... he went on about how he had a new chance at life (in reference to his drug use; he had been a heroin user for five years) and how he didn't want to disappoint anyone anymore or hurt me. I have not used and have no interest in using drugs, so I thought we could make it work if he really wanted to make the change.

We had been together pretty much every day since - we hit a bump once he started working (he is an electrician) and complained about his back hurting (which he had broken in two places years before) at work. So he started self medicating with methadone pills, except that he didn't tell me. So when I found out, I was upset.. not about the methadone, I tried to make that clear to him, but I was upset about the fact that he didn't seem to trust me enough to tell me about it.

I thought that was going to work just fine for him - until I left this weekend overnight. He decided to take this opportunity in my absence to shoot up methamphetamine with my cousin. Both my roommate and my cousin confirmed that he invited my cousin over for the specific purpose of shooting up meth together, but my boyfriend lied about it - right up to the end.

We got in an argument when I confronted him about it, and he basically told me that I wasn't his mom. All I wanted to get from that confrontation was for him to be honest with me, and then we might be able to work with getting him some help (my sister is currently being treated at a methadone clinic... very expensive, but it works). But I was so angry with how sour the situation turned that I packed up my stuff and left (plus he wouldn't talk to me anymore, he ran away and locked himself in the bathroom).

I really love him and I wanted to make it work... I want to help him so bad. I feel like our relationship was getting to the point where he was resenting me because he felt like I was keeping him from doing what he wanted to do. But I'm wondering if I could ask him to try again if he does want to seek help with the methadone clinic? He's done programs like suboxone and subutex before that worked really well for him.

Met him. He said he was single.
He later confessed to being in a long distance relationship that he plans to end. 
I continued to cheat with him because I liked him. 
Had unprotected sex. 
He and I are over. They are still dating. We have a few mutual friends. Do I tell her?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When I met S, he had initially told me he was single. After keeping in touch, he confessed he was actually in a long distance relationship that he wanted to end for a while now. I didn't care because I was in the middle trying to end my failing relationship and wasn't interested in him anyway. We remained friends for but only talked through text and online. We talked a lot about our relationships and I ended my relationship. 

Soon after I broke up with my boyfriend, S asked to meet him for a hike, to which I obliged. Later, he confessed to having deep feelings for me. I admitted to having feelings for him as well. He said explicitly that he would break up with his girlfriend. We agreed not to date until he was single. However, we kept in touch and our conversations became more intimate. A month later, after going to see his girlfriend and failing to break up with her, he drove directly to my house and kissed me. We had sex. I know I should have stopped him and it is entirely my fault that I didn't. At the time, I was head over heels for him and wasn't thinking. He assured me that he will most certainly break up with her next time. 

From then, we continued to talk, but he would often lead the conversation to sex. He sent nudes and asked for some back. I very incredibly stupidly agreed, as I like him a lot. I suspected I was being used, but I denied it. He invited me over twice, and we had sex (unprotected) both times. Afterwards, he would not sort of ignore me or talk to me very much. I thought it was that he felt guilty and needed space. He constantly assured me that he liked me and definitely needed to break up with his girlfriend. The next time he came back from seeing her, he broke up with me instead. 

It had been month, and I do believe I was lied to and used. He made t clear he would not tell his girlfriend and they are still together. Do I tell her? I feel that she should know who she is really dating (4yrs). But I  afraid of retaliation, as she sounds like a spiteful person and we have a few mutual friends. I also don't want my ex to know I moved on so fast, since we are still good friends and don't want to hurt him. However, I am really bothered by the fact that he is continuing to deceive her and am angry that he used me and lied to us both. What do I do?

22204,Dating,2saiyb,"To start off, this is by far the most complicated relationship I have ever been in and it’s driving me crazy. 

I am extremely close with my friend and she knows more about me than anybody else including my own family and anybody I previously dated. We get along on an emotional level extremely well and I've never felt so connected with anybody, not even my previous girlfriend of more than 4 years (more on this later). Its like she's the sister I never had and I can talk to her about anything. We've been friends for a few years but started getting very close about a year ago now. 

So problems started when we both got really drunk one night and slept with each other. Afterwards we decided that it would be best to stay friends and we were both just drunk. I thought things would be better but something has definitely changed, even our friends are asking us separately if we are dating now. I am extremely torn on what to do, especially since I don’t think I am ready for that kind of relationship. 

I just ended my previous long-term relationship in October. That relationship was not very healthy for me. I was bullied by my ex to stay in the relationship when I tried breaking it off multiple times and she was extremely dependent on me for a lot of things. That made me realize that I am not emotionally mature enough and I had resolved to not get into anything for a while. 

So that brings us to where I am now. I am scared to lose what is probably the most important friendship of my life, but I don’t know what I am supposed to do. I definitely have feelings for her, but she also isn’t what I would normally consider my “type”, and combined with my perceived emotional immaturity I can see myself messing this up for good. 

She has decided it was best if we don’t talk at all for a few months and it hasn’t helped me so far. It’s only been a few days and I already really miss talking with her. I am really scared that at the end of this I will lose her as a friend anyway. 

I am sorry if that made no sense. It’s difficult for me to talk about these things. Basically I was hoping to get some opinions, especially on whether its possible to be close friends again and if not if I should just trying being in a relationship with her since I do have feelings for her.

However I was heartbroken about it and it was a factor that led to my SH last night. 

Anyway, we spent an hour in my car talking and crying and trying to figure things out. I was really trying to hold myself together, he even noted that I was taking it well.

That's the only information I have about his health. We've been texting a little and I'm definitely interested. Granted we're currently only interacting on a very superficial level, but I'd have had no idea he had any mental health conditions if he hadn't volunteered that early.

22221,Breakups,3iimgv,"I have been dating a guy for approximately 3 months, maybe a bit more. We hang out every weekend, text sporadically throughout the week, and have plans to go camping with another couple next month.


Backstory:
We worked together 10 years ago, had a bit of a fling where he ended up dumping me unceremoniously while in bed after the first time we'd slept together, midway through a cross-country roadtrip, and then proceeded to ignore me for 5 days. While this was all water under the bridge emotionally, it did kind of shape how I relate to men as an adult.


We hadn't talked in years, but stumbled into each other on Tinder. He asked me out and I agreed with the only intention of catching up and telling him how much he had hurt me back then. 

He ended up being very sweet and considerate and apologetic and we kind of felling to dating.


At first it was very casual but I found him very considerate and loyal. While it wasn't planned like time to meet the parents!, we did spend time with eachothers' families.


However, over the past couple of weeks, I noticed he was pulling away a bit. I chalked it up to him being very busy -- he owns his own business and he's building a house which he assists with on weekends. Plus, he has a new puppy.

During all this time, we never talked explicitly about where our relationship was going. Early on I asked him what he called me to his friends, and made a bit of a joke out of it:


Option A: this girl I'm banging
Option B: my friend ______
Option C: nothing


He chose B.


Then several weeks later I casually asked if he saw our relationship going anywhere. His response was, Sure! Yeah!


At this point I was fine with the status quo, so I left things as they were.


But as time progressed, I started to wonder where it was going. Guys were asking me out and I wasn't sure how to respond. It all FELT very relationship-y but he is a man of few words and a bit aloof, so it hadn't been communicated as such. 


For two weeks the timing was never right to bring up the topic (we were hanging with family). He's also not very communicative. He does NOT like discussing difficult things.

This weekend we made plans to hang out Saturday evening. He was busy working during the day, and I hadn't heard from him by 6PM. I texted: Hey, let me know when you're done and you can come by my place (I had bought stuff to make dinner).


He said he wasn't done working yet.

6:30 - He texts to say he's leaving the job site and why don't I come with him to pick some things up and then we can get food. I say sure and assume he'll be picking me up.

6:55 - He tells me to come to his place and we can go from there.


It takes me 15-20 min to get there, so I gather my things, lock up, and head over and arrive at 7:15ish.


He's kind of grumpy and mad, saying Well I guess we can't go now


I guess the store closed at 8 and we needed the entire hour to shop for his things. I am used to dealing with grumpy people, so I kind of just kept the situation calm and cheerful and we ended up getting almost all the stuff he needed.


Had dinner, hung out. But he wasn't very cuddly or affectionate, and I ended up leaving at 10, knowing he had to get up early. I had planned on bringing up our status, but I chickened out because he was so grumpy. However, on the drive home, I thought, fuck it. I saw he was on Facebook chatting with people, so I just rang him up.


I was really nervous and probably babbled a little, but the gist was that I felt maybe he wasn't into our relationship, which was totally fine, but I'd like some clarity. 


He was understandably irritated, but he told me he's been so busy lately. That he doesn't know what I expect from him. I explained I didn't expect anything except clarity on what we were. He suggested we talk another time, and I said that was fine, and suggested he think about it.


I hadn't heard from him in a few days, and I was feeling badly that I had kind of ambushed him like that -- I know it was terrible timing -- so I texted to apologize and say that we have very different ways of communicating. That I prefer things to be more open and that will never change, but that I'm not interested in changing anyone else. I said I hoped his week was going alright.


No response in 2 or 3 days, which is rare for him.


So I took that to mean the relationship is over. But at the same time, we did have a good thing going. I've been very understanding of his tics and foibles, and it bothers me that he's just cut me out when I tried to have a discussion with him. I wasn't asking for a commitment if he didn't want one. I agree my timing was shit. But in the moment I was feeling hurt, rejected and there seemed like there would never be a good time -- it would always be me placating him because he's tired or busy.


I was tired and busy too. But I believe all relationships, especially ones with people with whom you've been consistently intimate for a third of a year, deserve the respect of honest communication.


I'm unsure of how to proceed. I feel bad. I feel lonely. And I feel a bit angry too.

22231,Breakups,32cpxh,"And we're going on holiday with her family for two weeks in the Summer.

This story is a bit confusing (for me at least) so I'll try to sum it up succinctly here.

We are in a Long Distance Relationship, Im moving into my third year of University at a place 2 hours away from where she lives, and she will be starting her first year at a place still two hours from me. 

For the past year and a half I've been certain that I love her, we have our holidays together (we both have our homes in the same place) and we will go see eachother every 3-4 weeks.

However she has been diagnosed with anxiety, which can make her feeling very depressed when she is under a lot of stress, or she is triggered by something (a comment made to her or even her own inner voice). However for the past few months she has been receiving therapy and is for the most part getting better.

The problem comes that I just can't handle both the long distance and the semi-regular negative attitude any more. I am myself a very positive person and have really really tried (and I think I have) been there for her throughout all of this, I love her (and I believe she loves me), and her parents like me too, hence why we are going on a two week holiday abroad together.

She has on a few occasions talked about how she can't handle the long distance any more as well, however these have always been at one of her 'low' periods, and she's usually relented a few hours later or the next day (this has only happened two or three times max). 


The issue is, is that I don't know when or how I am going to break up with her. Technically I can still back out of the holiday and end it now because I haven't paid her dad for my ticket yet (and it came up in conversation that if we did split then he could sell it or something). However I dont know if I could disappoint her like that, as she's been looking forward to this holiday for a very long time. Plus I am excited about the holiday too - like I said I still love her and I know we'll have fun.

I also think that I could break it off at the end of Summer, meaning she can start uni with a clean slate, and I can go back to Uni without that burden on me. But Im worried that if I do that I'll ruin and put a downer on what's meant to be an amazing couple of weeks starting University. 

Then finally, the anxiety worries me. She has had minor issues in the past with self harming and has once threatened suicide (though that scenario is long behind us now), but I worry how a break up may affect her. I hate making people upset, especially because I still love her.

Could anyone offer some advice? I still love her, but I don't think that this can bridge the gap of the long distance. I can't stand not having her around and I just wish she was living down the road from me.

Thanks.

I hope you can help me with this... I've been with my girlfriend (23F) for a little over two years now, previously we dated for 11 months and before that a few weeks. (With 8-9 months between each time)

We used to go to college together, and despite her living 20 minutes away, we saw each other every day. Things were going well and we were madly in love. 

Things started getting rough in January 2013 when she found out that i had lied about having sexual relations with my ex. (I don't recall lying but i admit, that was my mistake). This coupled with the simple fact that I dated someone (or dumped her for, in her words) else who she claimed to be 'stupid' and 'ugly' led us to fight on and off for several months.

I moved out of my parents to go live in the city where i pursued my career (I am now 30 minutes further away). My apartment wasn't that nice, in a basement with rock walls and all, and she hated the place as well as my friends /roommates so she refused to come over.

10 months later, during which we see each other once a week if we're lucky, I've changed apartment to something nicer. During those months however, we fought on the phone almost daily about how disappointed she is in me and stopped expecting anything. 

Due to our previously failed relationships, after two years her family is unaware of us dating, and only 2 of her friends know. She refused to tell people because She'd look stupid

Our conversations are now 'polite indifferences' according to her and I agree. We talk about her crappy her job is, and how I'm dealing with my issues at work.

We've talked about ending it countless times but I've always backed out, out of fear.. now I can admit that I've become depressed and miserable and I feel weak. For several months in a row I would smoke about 4 joints an evening just to numb and distract myself.

She's moving now, over an hour further away. We're back to talking about breaking up, this time seriously. 

I don't know how to do it. Because of how long we've been together...I don't know what to do. I'm unhappy in the relationship, we both are. But we do love each other... 

I do believe it has to happen, but I'm feeling weak again.

I might have skipped a few details, I'll answer any questions or anything, I just need someone to talk to...

22235,Breakups,2utf1j,"We met on Tinder, hit it off really well, and became a couple.  We were only official for about 2 months but dated for 4.  Anyway, everything was going great, until literally overnight I stopped hearing from him.  He was very distant from me, and when he finally told me the truth he said he was just stressed because he got laid off from his job and needed some space.  

Ok, fine, space it is.  Things don't really improve, some days are better than others, but he tells me the same company that laid him off ended up offering him a different position with a raise.  Yet he was still distant from me.  I called him on it because the stress should be over now and he tells me the real truth: That he still really likes me but has been struggling with whether or not he's actually gay.  He said his friends have been telling him for the past couple weeks to tell me that he was struggling with this.  He also said that he wants me to be his friend, and that his friend group really likes me and it was nothing I did, but that he's not wanting to be in a relationship.

From here, I wanted to make it clear that I liked him but would not be waiting around for him to make up his mind.  I have a life to live.  However, because of the chance that he will stop denying that he is gay due to stresses of work and family (which I believe is the truth) I'm having a hard time getting over him.  It's been a week and I really want to ask him or his friend if he was just being nice to me by saying he still liked me and was just confused about his sexuality, or if he's really just not interested.

22242,Breakups,1ov3lk,"X and I were nevermets for over a decade. Our early years were fraught with immaturity on both sides but we cared about each other immensely. We'd talk daily for months, fight, stop talking for periods lasting between a few weeks to a few months. Once the silence lasted a little over a year.

This year we finally got the opportunity to meet and the 'I Love You's of our online relationship became real. However, after two and a half  months of dating I decided to break things off for a number of reasons. I struggle with Borderline Personality Disorder and the distance was putting immense stress on me. On top of that, we come from very different backgrounds and I struggled with the idea of merging our lives. It would be incredibly hard work that would require huge sacrifices I wasn't sure I could make. Another huge point of contention for me was I felt as though I was putting in more effort than he was. I was the one spending hundreds to go visit him, I modified my school plan so that I could support him in the future (we had talked seriously about marriage, children, and our future), I bought him gifts and sent him money ($200.00) to get a Visa so that he could come visit me in Vancouver. 

(The money was sent after our break-up. I still wanted him to come visit, he still claimed he wanted to. But he never started the process and as far as I know the money is just sitting in his bank account.)

After the break up he asked that I keep him informed of anything I did with anyone else (dating, intimacy, etc) and I wasn't comfortable with this. I felt it wouldn't do either of us any good and it made me feel like I felt when we were children. He would demand to know what I was doing with men and then berate me. This was what often sparked our long periods of non-communication. When I broke up with him it was not because I wanted to be with other people, but I will admit I turned to an old coping mechanism of having sex with an old FWB in an effort to feel connected/wanted. Then, a great guy approached me at work and we ended up dating for two weeks before he left for the UK. Despite all this I still had feelings for X and would talk to him every day. We still exchanged I love you's and he tried desperately to get me back - going as far as offering to propose. 

A week ago we had a huge blow-up in which he revealed he had been accessing and reading my e-mails and knew that I hadn't been truthful about the things I had done. (I had confessed to drunkenly making out with a friend of a friend but declared there was nothing else). This wouldn't have been out of the norm for us 10 years ago but I didn't expect it now. I thought we had grown past that. He felt that he was in the right and I had been dishonest and I felt that I owed him nothing as we weren't together and had expressed how uncomfortable I felt with disclosing every aspect of my intimate life.

Now I am in a position where I have come to realize he means the world to me and I'd like to make it work. A week ago he was telling me I was the only one he wanted, how much he loved me, etc. Now he is dating a new girl and doesn't want to get back together because of the drama. I will admit that I can emotionally abusive when I feel threatened/sad/scared/insecure and my violent mood swings are incredibly hard to handle and I continue to pursue therapy for this but I am so hurt right now. He still says he loves me and suggests that there may be a chance for us in the future but right now he's got this new girl to focus his energy on and he'd prefer we keep contact to a minimum until I can reign my emotions in.

I am devastated because I feel as though if he loved me like he said he did and wanted that future he would want to work things out. I understand I dated someone after our relationship ended and yes he did try to get me back then but I wasn't ready. And now that I'm ready to try again he isn't. I'm also crushed because our 10 year friendship is all but obliterated. We hardly talk and when we do talk it's mainly just confrontations and hurt feelings. My friends are telling me to walk away and let everything go but I'm struggling to give up on ten years and the hope that he'll love me again.

We've both screwed up royally, but is there any chance of this working out? How do I get through this? I cry every day. I have massive panic attacks every day. I feel like my world is falling apart.

22252,Breakups,2it3gn,"In so many ways, I don't know where to begin. We met when she was a freshman in High School, now she is a Sophomore in College. We grew up in the same home town, we went to the same high school - I graduated a year before she did but went to a local community college so there was no long distance in my first year post high school. Last year, I transferred to a University in Chicago and she went to a college in Minnesota - this put us about 8 hours apart; but, we worked. We both came back during the Summer, and I transferred to a College that is ten minutes away from our home town, we are now five hours apart. 

Now that we have the geographic and chronological context down, here is our basic story. 
Met in her Freshman year, I asked her out. We dated happily for two years until I graduated, because of a disagreement and my stupidity I slept with someone else. I hid it from her for three months, pushing her away to make her leave me - as soon as she left, I realized my mistake and started fighting to get her back. Three days after we broke up, she comes over and we make love - halfway through she tells me that it is a mistake, that she didn't want or enjoy it, and leaves. I get a phone call from a female friend of mine who knows I just broke up, and I spend the night in the female friends bed. I hide that, and the original fact that I cheated from my girlfriend while I try and win her back. I know, I am an asshole.

Two months after we  broke up, (October 12th to December 19th 2012), I finally get her back. We work it out and I tell her about a week into the relationship that I slept with that friend during the break-up. I have noticed in the time since she left me that she has undergone some very, very dramatic personality changes. She is displaying signs of depression, mood swings, stuff like that. I stop lying to her about everything, but I don't tell her about the original cheating. On January 19th 2013, she gives me her virginity, and I still haven't told her. We are having the time of our lives, happier than we have ever been, and we are working -- but my dishonesty still keeps me up at night, rightfully so.

 On March 30th 2013, I tell her everything. Her and I fall apart, but don't break up. She says she wants to work through, and we do. We have no major conflicts after this, aside from her worsening depression which I struggle to manage. We argue about the affair, she connects it to the girl that I slept with when we were broken up, and we fight only about that. 

As time goes on, we grow happier and happier. The first six months were the hardest, but ultimately she leaves for college (August 2013) happy with me, having set it aside. Her depression lessens, and I leave the next month (September 2013) for my school. We have no major conflicts, we are immensely happy. There are of course fights, yes, but by and large we have left everything behind us and we have the time of our lives when we visit one another. Winter break 2013 is great, and we really are happy. This continues in to about February 2014, where her depression starts to pick back up. I do everything I can, she does everything she can. The cheating becomes something we argue about, and this trend continues all the way until the end of Summer 2014, a few months ago. Her and I have been happy, her and I have had so much fun, but at the end of Summer 2014 I snap and tell her that she either leaves the affair in the past or I leave her. I know that what I did was immensely wrong, I never blamed her for it or made excuses for it. I feel, and felt then; however, that there is only so long one has to hold on to something before it needs to be let go.

We work things out before she leaves for college, and go back to being extremely happy. I let her know that I am going to be busy building a life at my new, and last college, a place I transferred to for myself and to be closer to her. The college is in a city that her and I have so many memories in. In the 7 weeks I have had leading up to the breakup at this college, there were no major fights, just a bunch of little times where I shut her down or closed off. I would say maybe five times. I wasn't only closed off, but I admit that I could have been more available. 

The Saturday night before the break up, which occurred Wednesday, September 24th - she was out drunk and spent 30 minutes talking to a guy from her Spanish class in their dorm lounge at 4 AM. He tried to kiss her, she said no and called me. I got mad that she put herself in that situation but ultimately decided to move on, that Wednesday, I get a text from her saying that she won't be able to visit during Fall Break because she got scheduled for work. I was upset, she had promised to visit three weeks after her school started, and I had let that go. I felt like she was no longer placing the priority on our relationship, and that Wednesday night I told her that I needed some kind of compromise on her end that demonstrates commitment. She just went cold and said that she hadn't been happy for a long time, and thought that we were unhealthy. I was so stunned and hurt that I asked her if she wanted to break up, she said that she thought that we should and I told her that I understood, and that I would go.

I did this because for so long, I blamed her depression diagnosis on myself. I know that I have made a few big mistakes, and they are big mistakes, but I also know that I am a very good boyfriend and I never make the same mistake twice. Her tone, and her words hit me in a very, very soft spot and I said that I would go. I did go. For about an hour. Then what I had just done hit me like a freight train and I called her and she didn't pick up. I left a voice mail on her phone and sent her an e-mail begging her to talk to me on Thursday. We talked that Thursday, and it was good but she said that she wanted a day to think -- I agreed, told her I would give her my best, but I called her that Friday and asked her not to write me off. I was so scared that every day I didn't reach out she was drifting farther away, I felt like I had to fight for her. On Friday, I called her and she got mad, I asked her to give me a chance to make a case for our relationship on Saturday, she said okay. On Saturday, we spoke on the phone and I spent two hours trying to convince her. She lashed out, she gave me her reasoning

You have hurt me too much, I don't have any more tears to cry in this relationship. -- I don't feel that this is fair because for years after the cheating, her and I were happy and I have been completely honest. We do not abuse one another, and we are so happy when we are together.

I tried to get her to reconsider, and I failed. She admitted that if we were in person, things would be different, I asked if I could come up to her and she said not to, she said she would feel manipulated. I asked what she wanted and she said 'space, give me a day.' Sunday, I didn't go up to her, as much as I wanted to. That night though, I came back to my dorm-room at 8:30 and my roommate wasn't home, and I was so desperate that I called her. It went well until it seemed like she remembered she didn't want to be with me, and then she told me she loved me and hung up. 

I didn't call her Monday, or Tuesday. On Wednesday, October 1st 2014 she messaged me on Facebook and we talked for an hour from 4 to 5. It was fun, healthy, we talked about going on dates when she came back, and I tried to be her friend. It hurt me so much to back off but I did. The same thing happened Thursday, as long as I wasn't discussing the breakup she was happy to speak with me, and she was light-hearted. I felt like she was holding me at arms length in an attempt to figure out whether or not she could be without me, I felt used. 

On Friday, the 3rd, I told her that I wasn't going to be just her friend, it hurt too much and if she wanted me in her life she needed to give me a chance to see her in person. She said that her depression was getting worse, and I told her that I wanted to be there for her and she said that I was a day late and a dollar short for being there for her. She said that if I had cared enough, this never would have happened. I bore through the pain, and told her that it wasn't fair for her to accuse me of not caring.

Friday night, I called her and made the case again for our relationship, she said no -- I told her that I was leaving then, because it was too hard for me to be kept at arms length. She said that she needed a night to make the decision what she wanted to do, and that she would call me after she got off work. Saturday morning, she said that she was coming down on Sunday, the 12th of October 2014 and that we could talk every day until then. We spoke Saturday and Sunday, and it was so good. We facetimed on Sunday and had a blast, on Monday she started to get colder, but still maintained contact. Monday night she wrote me an email that said she cared for me and that no matter what happens she wanted me to know that she loved me and cared for me. Tuesday, I asked her about the e-mail and she said she didn't remember writing it; however, on Tuesday she told me that she looked forward to seeing me and didn't want to go into anything with her mind made up. 

Yesterday, I tried to discuss what this week had meant, and she got very cold. She told me that I had been hearing what I wanted to hear the entire time and that she felt like she needed to invest the energy of a relationship in herself. I had a low, and in a desperate ex-boyfriend moment asked her if she would have even called me that day if I hadn't reached out to her first. She said she would have. We fought a little bit, the conversation ended coldly at about 10:00 and at 10:30 I called her and told her that I didn't want her to think about the night angrily, that I was sorry we fought and that I missed her. She said the same, and hung up. 

Today, I called her at 11:30 AM and told her that last night should not have happened, and I understand that if she wants the day to herself I can give it to her. She said she needed it, and that she was going to see her Psychiatrist about developing an antidepressant regimen. I told her that I would be here if she wanted to discuss it, she said thank you and I told her that I loved her and that I am sorry about the way things had turned out last night. She said she loved me too, but that she was tired of hearing sorry. I told her that I hadn't thanked her for giving me the chance to work things out, that I knew it must be hard on her too, and that I was proud of her and that I believed in her. She said thank you, we exchanged I love yous, and she hung up.

At 3:30 today I got a text that said
I hope your day is going well. I am starting to take 10 mg of Lexapro every day, and the doctor says I have depression, mood instability, and a chemically overactive brain.

I would prefer not to get into it, but I thought you would want to know.

Thanks for your support.

I responded, 
Hey, I got your Facebook message. Would you like me to call tonight? It is up to you, I understand if you want the space.
I am alright.
I know, I know you are strong. I just wanted to ask if you want someone to talk to. I am proud of you.
Thanks
Do you want me to wait until tomorrow to call still?
Yeah
Okay, I understand. I love you, I believe in you. I am proud of you. I will call tomorrow at four, have a beautiful night. Look, I know that this has all got to be scary, and that this has all got to be big and confusing. I am still right here, you are not alone.
I appreciate that I will be okay
I know, I will call you tomorrow at four, don't be afraid to reach out in the meantime. I want to help, I feel right now the best way for me to do that is to give you space. If that changes, just call.

I don't know what is going on, why this is all happening, what she wants, or where to go. I am going to see her in person Sunday, but I am terrified that her anti-depressants will make her not care about anything. I am just scared and hurt, I know I am guilty of a lot but I have earned the right to call myself a worthwhile man with two years of honesty and good love. We have such history and I don't want it o be thrown away. Please offer any perspective you can, thank you for your time.

**tl;dr**:
After five years of ups and downs, battling with depression and one time infidelity, I feel like my ex- who left me two weeks ago over the phone, is shutting me out and all I want to do is help. Please offer some perspective, I am scared and hurt. Thank you for your time.

22254,Breakups,2wwgyv,"I guess I'll start at the beginning. My ex and I met on a dating site 4 months ago. We had an *amazing* first date. No awkwardness a all, we hung out for several hours and both had a fantastic time. Aside from a silly 2-day breakup during the first month, we've pretty much been together and happy ever since.

Things got a bit complicated after the first month when he lost his job. He no longer had any money for dates, but I continued to pay for our dinners and everything because I still wanted to have fun with him. He was very grateful and promised to take me out for lots of great dinners once he had money.

Fast forward to last week, valentines day. He just recently got a new job, yay! We spent an amazing day together. We exchanged thoughtful gifts and went for a great dinner, which he paid for. We talked about how great it was that he finally had a job and now we can do all the fun stuff we had wanted to do, like dates to amusement parks, etc.

During the valentines day weekend I asked if he wanted to come over for dinner the following Wednesday to celebrate our 4 months together (not a big thing, just wanted to see him!) and he happily agreed. Wednesday comes, and the following (paraphrased) conversation occurred between us:

Me: Hey so are you coming over at 4?

Him: Babe is it okay if we cancel today and just hang out this weekend? I want the night to myself.

Me: Okay I guess if that's what you really want

Him: [an hour later] I changed my mind, I want to come over.

When he came over I tried asking if he was upset with me or if anything was wrong, but he denied it and claimed he was just tired but then changed his mind.

Fast forward to last night. I had slept over and he seemed to want to rush me out of his place and get me home as soon as possible. When we got to my house I told him that we don't spend enough time together and I want to see him more often. This is when he revealed that he didn't want to spend more time together. He hadn't been tired on Wednesday, he really just didn't want to come over. He told me he still likes me and cares about me, he just doesn't see our relationship going anywhere.

Guys, I'm so confused. I didn't see any indication that he felt that way until this week. Valentines day was amazing. He claims he's been thinking about this for a month but that just makes no sense to me. It's like a switch flipped after valentines day that changed his feelings.

We agreed that later on we'll probably text each other to check in and maybe eventually try being friends, but I can't be happy with that. I like him so much and I want him back. Reddit, what was he thinking? What should I do?

22258,Dating,1lrwb1,"After graduating high school I decided to take a break from relationships because I was going to college. Figured going to work part-time and school full-time would be too much to handle. I have a history of long term relationships where I tried my damnest to make it work (one of them including a three year battle with an ex and his addictions/bi-polar issues). But I found the process--even the healthy relationships--to be too taxing if the proper conditions weren't met (what type of relationship we had, our schedules, how far away they lived, etc). 

In May of this year I left college. My family was moving across the country. I decided to stay in this state and move one county over to move back in with my mother. I've been here since June, started a new job, and am trying to make new friends since mine are an hour away now. I work overnights the situation is a bit more stressful than I'd like. 

At my overnight job I met...let's call him Allen. I walked into the breakroom my first week there and saw him making his chainmail armor with pliers and little metal rings. Instantly had a crush. Usually, those go away after a while. I'm not the type to go gushing after people and these past three years made me very skilled in rejecting those types of feelings. 

My sister got me the job at this overnight place. So we work together. She introduced Allen and I and he seemed a bit intimidated by me. Over the next two weeks we'd all have lunch together. My sister would group message us and one night he asked if we could save my number. At this point we just had very idle chat. But I was  a bit excited and said yes (I assumed he didn't like me because he seemed intimated when we met). 

We were texting for about two weeks. One night we were both off and he asked if I wanted to go to this restaurant I recommended to him a week earlier (I suggested we ought to go and quickly added we should go with our other coworkers so he wouldn't think I was hitting on him, it's a restaurant that's slightly more on the expensive side). He said he could pick me up and we could go to the movies after. So we went out.

We spent four hours at the restaurant talking and almost missed the last showing of our movie. Near the end of our dinner my sister texts me asking if I like him and if it's date. I said no. He pays for my beer and my movie ticket. We make plans to hang out five days later. 

The next night his best friend (who also works with us) said he liked me. I confronted him and since then we've been on four dates. He's a great guy. Very sweet, sensitive, compassionate, thoughtful, etc. A great catch. I know if we became official we'd both give it our all (like me his past relationships lasted a very long time and he dedicated a lot them them). 

Great. Except he said he's moving to Brooklyn this spring for college. I'm happy that he's going back to school but I don't think I can handle dating someone who lives an hour away. I don't think it would be fair for us to only see each other once a month (assuming he or I have the money to commute). With him going to school full-time, me working almost full-time then going back to school part-time AND working overnights, I don't see how it'll work without being frustrating. 

I like him. I do. But for me I feel as though I should end it now before it becomes an official thing (or while he continues to develop bigger feelings for me and vice versa). I don't want to be with him for six months only to dump him when he leaves. That's not fair to either of us to start something with a known expiration date. 

The reason I won't do it just for the experience: He's very sensitive. I don't want to do that to him. I know he's an adult but I think it's borderline cruel to be with him for six months just to leave later. I already know I don't want to be with someone who lives in the city. It completely clashes with my schedule and I don't want to live so far away. Distance is my biggest factor in dating. 

My family (mother, sister, grandmother, etc) disagree. They're telling me I'm thinking too far ahead and to just go with it. That my parents lived in different states when they dated and ended up being married for 30+ years, and so on. From my perspective, I'm trying to do damage control and end this before it gets too conflicted with feelings. I'm looking out for him so his feelings don't get hurt and so I don't put myself in a bad emotional situation. I've spent three years single and had a string of bad relationships, I'd like someone who is physically here with me, who I can see at the drop of a hat like we've been doing. I like the idea of being able to just go to his house if I need to, or doing a lunch date before work, etc. It's become of my simple pleasures this month, but I don't want it becoming complicated and turning into a whole game of hide and seek. We find it difficult *now* to find time hanging out and we work together. Those times where we don't see each other for 3-4 days is so boring and taxing already. I don't think I can handle that in a week or month timespan. My family disagrees and they're really pushing it on me.


He knows I've been on dates with a couple other people. We know it's not officially and that we're not committed right now. But how do I bring this up to him and talk to him about it? We're going on a date this Friday and I'm unsure how to resolve this once and for all. I know I need to get his perspective of the situation (for all I know he thought about this and already has a plan to come down and visit, all his past relationships were very long distance so he's used to it). 

Do I think about that? His previous relationships and how he made them work despite being in different states? I know that's a good sign; I'm just uncertain if I'm capable of doing that.

22264,Breakups,2wj996,"As the title states its been two years since I [m/20] broke up with my ex[f/21], now I'm not looking for an answer but just wanted to tell my story to someone.

Freshman year of college, what a golden year. I had it all, the parties, the girl and the friends but it would slowly be taken away from me like some moral story you tell your kids.

I was rushing a fraternity and got a bid, and at the first party I went to, I ran into this girl. A cute drunk sophomore, she was friends with another friend of mine and we talked for a little bit. After the party, I asked around for information, she was single but according to her friends she wasn't looking for a relationship but I always like a challenge. Fast forward to next weekend and another party, I ran into her again, she was dancing with her friends and I called her out for kissing one of her girlfriends. She responded with What you want one? Of course, After a night of heavy dancing I walked her home and I got invited to her apartment party she was having. Next night we stayed pretty close together escaping the party every so often to make out. At one point someone asked if we were dating, she looked at me, and I told him, We have the potential to be and later that night we were.

Now to save time, we dated for about 6 months, we were both each others firsts and I for the first time could actually say I was in love. However I ended up being told I could not continue pledging and thats were things started to go down hill. I was pretty invested and soon that sadness turned into anger. She also joined a sorority the same year, and of course I was bitter about it. After loosing a great group of friends it was pretty hard for me but I pushed on. 

Summer came and I was still on campus for a little while, her sister was visiting, to clear this up first, not at any point have I done anything with her sister, and she asked me if I was going to the beach. I was confused not being invited and pestered my ex about it. She ended up inviting me but little did I know it was suppose to be a sorority sister thing. I fucked up... A week later, I got the call, Its not you, you deserve better Holy shit was I reck.

Now it doesn't get any prettier from here. I wrote her a hand written letter asking for a second chance, no response, I asked a mutual friend (don't do this....) and it wasnt looking good. She said I did little things that bothered her and it bottled up. (I'm not mad at her but I really wish she told me...) Before she broke up with me, her friend invited me to her birthday party. She kept me on the invite to probably reduce awkwardness (Shouldn't have gone, it was one of the few times I have cried in front of people.) As I was trying to move on, I got a snapchat from my ex's sister.

Now of course I treaded water as fucking careful as possible. my ex's sister was accepted to the same school as us so I would rather not fuck more things up. At one point I asked her if she knew my ex and I broke up. She did but thought we could be friends still. I let up a little, and chit chated with her. I was an RA for the next year and let her know if she needed anything she could ask. She lived in my ex's shadow a little bit and wanted to make sure she could have her own experience. However a week into school I got a call from my boss wanting to talk to me.

Welp being RA was fun, how did I fuck this up. No I havent been stalking my ex's sister.... That was the issue, I emailed my ex saying basically if we could keep business and personal life separate, but she denied saying anything (It could have been one of her friends, I never found out.) Basically that burnt the last bridge with any chance with my ex again...

Now time went on, I dated another girl for a month, she broke up with me but no feelings continued after a short weeping time. Over the summer of my sophomore year I kinda went a little crazy and had my fair share of different girls. Now half way into my junior year this is where I stand. Every so often, having fun or being sad, I get a feeling, and I think of her. I often wonder how she views me now...

The trouble is that before she left, she revealed insecurities stemming from her past relationships and wanted to ease up a little before she left. She then seemed to push me away while saying that things were still fine. Since then, I've received nothing that even resembles our past communications and I'm left to wait out the rest in total uncertainty.

22274,Dating,3cg7dx,"To begin, I met this girl off a dating app

I've been seeing this girl do about a month and a half now. We've been on multiple dates most recently on the Fourth of July. I've noticed her acting a little distant lately. Not necessarily replying to me with much enthusiasm as before in her texts or being as flirty as she originally was.

I'm not too sure if I'm over thinking things or if this is normal because I have never really been the dating type of person so this is all new to me.

Yesterday I was texting her and she was kind of halfheartedly replying. Her friend's plane ride home was postponed so I figured that may have been the reason for her mood. However, she didn't really talk to me all day and at night, I had asked her what she did and she was like nothing just watched TV. Then as were talking later she said that she was getting yelled at by her mom for going out all the time. So that kinda irritated her So I was a bit confused by the conflict in story.

I guess another thing I can put would be that on our last date. I noticed she was texting someone named Ricky on her phone and I noticed their conversations had quite a bit of smiley faces in there. When I playfully asked her who it - we have an inside joke of pretending to be jealous every time we see someone they're talking too -  she just laughed and said no one.

I say unspoken relationship because we haven't put a label or said anything has been official. She's hesitant because she's scared of commitment as am I. She's afraid of the possibility of heartbreak especially since she may be moving soon. But we act like the best of friends and IMO what I think a couple would act like - hugging, holding hands occasionally, cuddling.

But like I said, yesterday she was speaking very tentatively and to put it bluntly boring. I don't know how I should take that. Are relationships supposed to stale out quickly like that?? I'm not too sure if that's normal or not. Which is why I'm here.

I mean, as far as I know she has a picture of us on her background of her phone but I don't know. I'm feeling a bit paranoid. Am I over thinking things or should I keep my guard up?

I feel like a terrible person writing this out but our family can't deal with this anymore. Right now our mother is in Mexico visiting family after a few really bad arguments with our Dad, mostly money related things. This morning we found our dad sitting at the kitchen table crying into his palms, I don't think I have ever seen him like that. After a really long family discussion we found out that our mother has been cheating on him for years and that he's decided this time he doesn't want her back.

A little back story about our mom. She has not worked a day in her life, she had me at 19 and my Dad has financially supported her since, every time my dad even brought up the idea whoop she's pregnant again. She was born in Mexico but came the U.S. when she was 3yo, our dad was born in America (but is of Japanese descent) and she always gives him shit about it mostly things like Of course you have a job you're a citizen, you were born here don't you understand how hard it is for me?. I was first born and the minute she give birth to my sisters she was done, she sat around looking at TV while I looked after them, I drove to ballet and karate classes that I also paid for. My dad gives her nearly $700 dollars a week and still gives her another $300 for house supplies which she doesn't buy. My wife cleans the house, cooks every meal, does laundry for me and my father, takes Yuna to classes work and meetings, and still works from home. 

I remember her constantly telling my sisters to find a wealth husband and give her grandkids or complaining that my younger sisters boyfriends were low class. She nearly disowned Rie when she came out but our dad was always supportive of her and even started inviting her girlfriend over on holidays. She would tease Yuna about her darker skin tone when she was a kid and it made her so self conscious and depressed. She'd drank beer with every meal, which I usually made, and harder liquor throughout the day and she's a bad drunk. If our dad also decided to drink then there would always be a fight and she'd always say she would rather be in Mexico than with us usually followed by her actually leaving for a month or more. No calls to us only to our dad ask him to transfer her more money.

So now my parents are in the golden age of facebook, they're addicted to it. She's in Mexico right now and posts a lot of pictures mostly family things with her siblings and fishing/hiking trips and i feel so depressed watching her be happy, i have never seen her that happy around us EVER. She's been there two weeks and sometimes photos that other people tag her in come up, photos like a guy with his arm around her, her wedding ring not on, sitting on a mans lap, and the final blow to my dad, her kissing that man. Her brother our Uncle tagged her in that. Dad immediately tried to call, no answer. Called her brother, he told him everything. For nearly a fucking decade she's been telling everyone that they've separated and having a long messy divorce, the guy in the photos is her boyfriend of just as long. 

At this point our father would rather her not return (she does have a house there and the majority of her family) but he doesn't know how to say this to her without losing calm and ending in a fight. 


tl;dr: We don't want our abusive alcoholic mother to return home after her finding out she's been cheating on our father for a decade. We don't how to tell her that she should stay in Mexico.

UPDATE1: After making calls to our cousins and aunt our mother group messaged us on facebook and said she was busy and we we're bother her, she'd call in 30 minutes if she's home. So lets see how this goes. I'll update again when we speak to her.

22276,Breakups,31823x,"My ex and I were together for almost 9 years. I was truly in love with him and did everything I could to save the relationship, but he just didn't want the responsibilities that come along with being in a committed relationship. I was hurt, but it was for the best that we separated and moved back to his home town. 

I was hurting so badly for the first month or so, but I held it together well and didn't let him know.  Then out of no where I felt this sense of happiness and freedom, and I felt like I had never been happier in my life, and my life finally had a stable direction. It was a beautiful thing.

About a month and a half after we broke up, he realized he had made a huge mistake and wanted me back. I wass finally happy so I told him no. He obsessively texted and called me every day and taled about how much he was hurting, how he was sure now that I was the one for him, he'd bever be happy again, blah blah blah. 

That went on for the next month or so. Then finally he hit his bottom when he considered suicide because he felt that he could never be happy again without me. I urged him to talk to his dad and get a counseling appointment set up, so he did. He let me know the next day that talking to his dad really helped, and he found a lot of peace from his counseling session. I wass happy for him because I still cared for him and I didn't want him to be miserable. 

The calls and texts stopped, and he seems to be in a good place now. Fast forward to yesterday. He has some stuff that he left at my place, and my brother has a business meeting in my ex's home town, so my brother was going to drop the stuff off at his place. I told ex that it would be Friday morning, and my ex said that wouldn't work because has (and I quote) ...plans with *someone* Thursday night... (tonight) and he plans on staying out really late. 

That hit me like a punch to my gut. It seriously felt like my heart got ripped out. He has been hanging out with people, but he has always said he's haning out with his brother, his sister, mutual friend of ours, etc. and uses names. This time it was like he emphasized that he didn't want me to know who that *someone* is. 

My initial first thought is that he's going out on a date. I get it. We're not together anymore, and nothing could ever get me to take him back, but at this point I can't help but feel like I don't want anyone else to have him either (as irrational as that is). 

I worked so hard to make him happy and be the one for him, and the thought that he is going out with someone and him actually putting in effort to make her happy makes me feel sick to my stomach.

I feel like I've done a total back slide into misery again, and this is not a place I want to be. I want to feel happy and free again. I want to not care if he's going on a date or having sex with someone else. I just want peace from him.

For the better part of three years I have been seeing this girl who I thought I was madly in love with. I still love her but lately I am feeling like she isn't as driven/determined as I am to accomplish her goals and this concerns me. She is still heavily dependent on her mother since she is still in school full time, and I don't blame her for it. I just find myself wanting someone further along in life and closer to where I am.

22281,Dating,3hv0m6,"This is a bit of an Epic Saga, but I’m going to try to be as short as possible.  Last October, I broke up with my then-boyfriend for a guy I met at a party at college.  I never believed in “love at first sight” until the moment I laid eyes on him.  We spent the entire party talking and left to play video games at his house for a while.  I hung out with him a few days and realized I had to start pursuing him.  At this time, he also broke up with his then-girlfriend, who he had been dating at the time for almost 3 years.  We start seeing each other, and everything feels more “right” than it has in any other relationship I’ve had: we never grow tired of each other, we have the same sense of humor, we have similar interests, we both agree that we have the best sex ever and can rarely keep our hands off of each other, and our personalities balance each other out flawlessly.

After about a month, I told him that I would want a relationship eventually, but was willing to wait as I knew he was fresh out of his last relationship.  He told me he didn’t know if he would be able to have a relationship anytime soon, so I decided to call it off with him. It was an incredibly hard decision, because I truly believe I had fallen in love with him that quickly.  I told him if he wanted to pursue other girls and be single, he could go do that, but we couldn’t be friends or contact each other because I needed time to get over him.  He agreed.  Two weeks later, he texted me.  A week after that, he was snapchatting me.  A week after that, he texted me again.  So I thought “well, better talk to him and see what he wants.”  We ended up seeing each other again and he told me “why ruin something that’s good?” and we agreed to be exclusive, but not “in a relationship.”  So virtually, we decided to date, but he has some weird hang up about commitment.

Fast forward to now.  In total, we’ve been involved with each other for almost 10 months.  We’ve graduated college together, have met each other’s closest friends and family, have gone on vacation together, and generally act as a couple do in every sense.  However, he still won’t admit to being my boyfriend and refuses to use titles or be “in a relationship” with me.  I suppose it’s a bit of a childish request, but after almost a year of seeing someone who I have the most perfect relations with, I’m offended, confused, and hurt about the fact that he doesn’t want to call me his girlfriend.  And the worst part is that he never gives me a clear reason, just always says that he isn’t ready.  He claims it isn’t about wanting to see other women, always gives me a look when I joke about him talking to other women, says he’s not dating or “talking to” anyone else, and so on.  He says he’s just not “ready for a relationship.”  In my eyes, we’ve been in a relationship for months now, so what gives?  I ask him to be mine at least once every two months, and I’m never met with success.

I’m close to reaching a breaking point - I don’t understand or appreciate his millennial attitude towards dating (we’re seeing each other but it’s not a relationship until we say it is - what?!), and it’s constantly on my mind that the man I’m in love with won’t commit to me in any way.  Is it time to call it quits? It’ll be the hardest relationship I’ve ever walked away from, because I can truly see myself being with him for the rest of my life, but I feel like I’m being messed about.

22286,Dating,33h0o4,"So I met this girl 2 weeks ago and we really hit it off. We've hung out a few times and things were really great. It was really easy and comfortable the whole time and we to got to know each other pretty quickly. In my opinion, maybe it was moving too fast but I guess it just kind of happened.

Anyways, the other night I was supposed to go to an art exhibition with her which we were both excited about until the last minute. She texted me saying that her ex would be there and that she didn't feel comfortable with him seeing us together because he was still super possessive and jealous about her. She asked if it would be ok to wait until she had talked things through with him and tell him that they both needed to move on. Apparently she's done this two times before and he just can't seem to accept it. I told her it was fine but she ended up skipping the exhibition altogether anyway and getting dinner with me instead. We spent the whole evening talking and just flirting/joking with each other. I dropped her off and we kissed goodbye for the first time. We made plans to see each other the next few days.

At one point in conversation we talked about our past relationships and she told me all about how complicated things were with her ex. They had been dating for 2 years and broke up this past winter around January because he wanted them to become more committed to each other and she didn't. She says she's moved on but he keeps dragging her back by making her feel guilty about leaving him. Apparently he doesn't have many close friends except her and keeps saying things like his life will never be the same without her or that he'll never be able to move on. She said this has been taking a huge emotional toll on her and wanted to cut ties with him completely, which I agreed was probably best for both of them. 

Cut to yesterday, she tells me that she is going to talk to him about everything. A few hours later, she says her night has been horrible and that she's feeling guilty etc. I called her to help her talk things out and she basically said the exact same thing happened like it always does. She's a sweet girl and feels like it's her fault that he will be hurt so much, especially since he says things to make her feel guilty. So I told her maybe she should write him a letter instead to tell him how she really felt. 

After I helped her sort herself out a bit, we talked about what would happen next. She felt like it would be best to pump the brakes on us (whatever we are at this point) and I completely agreed. I've been in an almost identical situation before and took the screw it all, let's just keep going route which ended very poorly so I figured this would be best for both of us. She still wants to spend time together but just stay friends until after she is able to work through everything with her ex and get back to herself. We ended on good terms and she said she would like to pick things back up when she felt ready.

So here I am, wondering what I should do now. I don't want her to lose interest in me but I don't want her to feel like I'm still trying to pursue her. We're usually really flirty with each other so that's going to be tough. I'm also nervous that if we spend time together as friends, she'll start to see me as more of a friend than a partner. I also don't know how long I should wait before I decide it's dragging on too long. I really care about her and I understand that she needs her time (I've been there before) but I know this can take more than a while to sort out. Thanks everyone, any advice is appreciated!

I broke up with her about four months ago. I don't dream much, but the only dreams I've remembered in the past four months have all been about her. We were miserable together after four years of the same problems hashing out over and over. I left her because I couldn't take her controlling behavior and felt that I was no longer living life for myself, but only for her.

The strange thing about all these dreams is that we were very rarely intimate in the last year or so of our relationship. I had pretty much lost interest in sex. Not because I didn't find her attractive any more, but because I was depressed and felt trapped in something I didn't want to be in any longer.

Now that I'm single I'm having a really hard time finding people to even go on a date with me, let alone sleep with. I tried Tinder, but it hasn't really worked out for me. Not sure why, as I am not an unattractive person... perhaps it's a lack of confidence.

I would just forgo the dating scene for awhile and focus on myself, but these dreams keep me thinking about whether I made the right choice ending the relationship. I have only seen her once post-breakup, and she mentioned that she's dating someone, so it's not like I can see if she would take me back... I'm not even sure that's really what I want...

I'm not sure what I'm really getting at here... I just am having a hard time waking up feeling depressed and lonely.

A year ago, we had a huge falling out because I found out he was deleting messages from a girl and deleting text messages. The messages said things like You're really pretty and silly flirting. He never went further than just texting, but considering we're both christians waiting till marriage, him hooking up with a girl would heighten the situation like crazy, so this was enough to be infuriated about.

He eventually told the girl they couldnt talk anymore and begged for my forgiveness for months, which I granted him once we discussed it with my pastor and he had truly been sorry. 

Fast forward to a year later, hes in now in college and were 950 miles away. Trust is imperative... we've always had eachothers facebook passwords and since the situation last year, through his itunes password he is alright with me viewing any imessages. (I'm not controlling, this was his suggestion and I hardly look at them). 

This past saturday he tells me he's afraid of commitment and is afraid of being with me his whole life (as i am his only girlfriend). I get he's in college and that it makes sense for him to be afraid of marriage... but it really was sudden. He tells me he loves me and wants to continue being with me, just that he's concerned if we'll actually be able to get married. (which wouldnt be for years anyway.....)

Well then I've noticed on facebook theres a girl from his school who has talked to him a lot (Like every single day) and been super flirty. Ex: he cut his thumb and she was all oh no! go to a doctor! Can I come over and get anything for you?!...it wasn't sincere concern it was obvious flirting considering the context and that they hadn't known each other long.  

Well at first he was in complete denial that she liked him and that there was anything more than friendship. My boyfriend is sweet, so he continues their conversations, and its obvious she likes his attention. But He denies it. Today she says to him I hate how we havent talked in a day, it feels like its been a whole week, Which he then admits that she likes his attention. 

So I tell him to obviously, *not give her that attention* and i mention how it bothers me. He just continues to defend her and tells me that they're just friends and that she talks to everyone like that. I can tell the girl is naturally bubbly, but she does know he's taken and can refrain from her overly kind personality.

I'm not sure if my boyfriend is truly oblivious, has interest, or is really just friends with the girl. Is it normal for guy and girl friends who have just met to talk everyday?? Im not sure if i'm overreacting or not... the long distance has also been hard on this situation as well.

22303,Dating,1uerq6,"Thank you very much, Reddit. I hope you guys can offer me some advice, since I am relatively new to this field. Which is probably why I'm so confused and lost and need guidance. (I am using a throwaway since my main reddit account is stalked by couple of my friends…) and hopefully I pray she is not a redditor because it would be quite embarrassing if she saw this .. 

Little about myself, I’m a 24 year old guy who really was more focused on his academics and gaming hobbies (very introvert) that didn’t care much about dating or meeting up with girls as much until recently. Most of my friends were actually males. And I rarely had female friends that hanged out or even just do stuff with. This is probably why most of this is relatively new to me. 

Anyways, I met a girl in in a lab where I used to work for almost a full year. She was a grad student there who began to work there around couple months before I quit. She really was a quiet type and didn’t talk as much and like was I guess shy. 

Me being a goofball, I really did random stuff like write jokes on broken equiptments or make a catch phrase that we used between us two. At this point I liked her but I never had to courage to tell her this and I didn’t want to make the workplace a living hell for me if she rejected me. Hence I kept my feelings to myself and just didn’t bother with it. We had our fun and before I left the work, I left on her desk which she and I both contributed to finish which up to this day it still is on that desk. I was surprised that she didn’t get rid of it. Before I left my position, I asked for her number and she gave me her number which I promptly texted her a couple times but I never really got around doing that often. 

After I quit this position to finish my professional degree, I have to be honest, but I was busy with school that I really never got around to keep in contact with her. I messaged her a couple times and gotten a response, but conversation kind of died out and I never rekindled the fire but I still rarely dropped by the lab and saw her and talked with her again. 

Fast forwarding a bit, to this recent New years Eve. Plans got canceled between friends thus I was just staying in for the new years this year. Out of some reason I went through my phone book and I saw that I still had her number, and I just decided to text her to see if she was up to anything. By luck, she texts back saying that she was staying home with her parents and just going to sleep at 10pm. I told her to stay up for new years and we ended up texting until 12:40am and we ended with her passing out. 

For the past couple days I kept texting her back and I ended up suggesting to her to come over to my place which is about 30 minute drive for her and spend the whole day watching a movie marathon with me and she should also taste my special dishes I will make for her as well. She said yes to it and we ended up picking sometime next week as the time. On top of that, she promised to come see movies with me and do snowball fights or go out to grab lunch or dinner together.

22304,Dating,2brz2j,"This actually happened before school ended, late last month. This girl, let's call her Beth, was one of my best friends, but I couldn't go on pretending I didn't feel anything for her. So one day after gym class, I told her. She didn't really respond, so I assumed she didn't feel the same way (I thought she did :/). I respected that but what I totally didn't expect was his she acted the next time we saw each other (in the cafeteria). She walked right passed me and completely avoided my gaze, as if I didn't exist. The same thing happened for our final two classes, even though I sit next to her in one of them. The next day, the final day of school, same thing. I didn't want to set her off, so instead of speaking to her directly I got one of my buddies to ask her if she was willing to talk to me about the day before (I still valued the friendship we had before this whole thing). Apparently, the second my name came up she shushed my friend. And so the day went on and I still was a ghost to her. It was almost like a superpower, how well she was able to pretend I didn't exist. Zero acknowledgment of me. We have no way of communicating over the summer- she's fairly sheltered by her parents, no FB and they read her texts. So when we inevitably see each other in a month, what do I do? This awkwardness can't go on- we have too many mutual friends to ignore each other.

A brief history of our relstionship: my brother owns a pretty massive guild on Guild Wars 2 and she (we'll call her Ashley) joined and we started to talk a bit on Teamspeak and started growing a rapore with each other.  One thing led to another,  and I drove 9 hours to go meet her.  We hit it off so quickly it was like bread and butter.  She is extremely beautiful, has an amazing outgoing personality, and knows who she is.  She has a little bit of a wild side, but promised to put that side of her away if we date. We decided that this long distance relationship is worth pursuing, so we go ahead and make it official between us after a month of randomly seeing each other. 

I start growing attached to her entire family.  They are all a bunch of super fun, nerdy, successful (job-wise) nerds and we all played together online when we didn't spend in-person time with each other.  Everything was perfect. 

We did more than just play games, tho.  When we were together, we went out and did things, be it hiking, going to the movies, traveling, anything really.  She also expressed interest in snowboarding, so we were planning on giving that a shot soon. 

My family is also a bunch of gamer nerds. And they loved Ashley so very much, they accepted her with open arms. They never met her in person, but we sometimes had group Skype calls and we would always talk with each other on our weekly Saturday Guild Night via Teamspeak. 

Things started to get serious. We fell in love with each other, she kept telling her friends and family on her own accord how this is the best relationship she's ever had and how I'm so amazing for her.  Prior to us meeting, she was in a dark place. She just moved to a new state to live with her dad and step mom (both amazing people) and she had no friends there. All her friends were those she had online. I came into her life and I brought her out of this hole. And she's told me this. 

We were starting to discuss how we were going to fix the distance problem. I have 1.5 years left in the military so I couldn't do it, so she would have to move. I started doing research for a bigger place to live  and she toured a couple new homes with me so I could get her input. She seemed so excited. 

We were also planning on taking a trip to my home state to finally have her meet my parents in March with a side trip to Las Vegas. We were both so excited for this. And a couple months later we were going to go and see her mom's side of the family. Everybody is super excited. 

Then things started getting grim... 

She's currently in college, and she's made it very clear that she wants to make friends and be social.  I fully 100% support her in making friends.  I told her that if she spends time with guys, she had to let them know she's in a relationship. Otherwise, have a blast. I trust her. 

She met this guy in school (we'll call him Scott). She told me about him and how he likes to snowboard.  Awesome, somebody she can get out of the house with and fix her need for social interaction while I'm not there. So she goes snowboarding with him last Saturday and has an amazing time with him, according to her.  She tells him that she is dating somebody and he seems perfectly okay with it. So I'm happy, she's happy, everybody wins. 

Last Monday night I ask her if she wants to Skype and play video games with later that night.  She responded with I don't know.... That's odd, usually she wants to hang out and play together.  Then she says but if you want to play tonight, we can do that :) I asked her if she was in one of her weird moods, and she said yes. I then asked her if everything was okay between us and she said yes. Awesome, let's move on and play tonight when I get home. 

I get home and told her  I'm about ready to settle down. I then call her on Skype and she doesn't answer. She's probably making tea or something, I think to myself. So I'll do something else while I wait for her to call me back. 

She then calls me on the phone. 

Odd, but whatever. I answer,  and she sounds excited to hear from me and asks what I'm doing. Then she tells me that she has some bad news for me.  I ask her what's up.  She gets silent and I basically have to force it out of her. I thought she was going to tell me she's pregnant or something. But no.  She tells me I'm a quiet voice I want to break up. 

I instantly panic and am in shock.  Where did this come from? What's wrong? What did I do? Is there another guy? 

I didn't do anything, and it's not the guy, she claimed. She said she realized she can't have fun while she's in a long distance relationship. Apparently she ft bad and guilty for how much fun she had with Scott snowboarding because I wasn't there to share it with her. I tried to fight it, but she wouldn't budge. 

She also said she doesn't even know if she wants to get married, have kids, or what she's going to do with her life in college. She's still trying to figure herself out in that regard, but she's pursing computer science, and she seems to be enjoying it. 

She makes it clear that she wants to remain in touch and that she cares for me a great deal. She liked a picture I put on our guild public forum yesterday, but didn't like anybody else's. A few days ago she totaled her car (I found out through her dad) so I sent her a message basically telling her I hope she's okay and if there's anything I can do, let me know. She responded the next day telling me that I'm too nice, but thanks for caring and she'll let me know if she needs anything. 

Both her mom and dad think she just got cold feet with how serious we were getting. And she found this new snowboarding guy and realized how he was a quick fix for her social cravings. 

When I think about Scott and Ashley together, possibly fooling around, it makes me want to puke. I had to get prescribed sleeping pills cuz I woke up every night, checking my phone, hoping she would have left me something. And then I cry. 

Not to sound like a baby, but I've cried myself to sleep every night this week. We were supposed to hang out in person this weekend, but since we broke up I took my motorcycle to my friend's house instead to hang with him for the weekend.

Everybody thinks she's going to be back, how she acted on impulse and fear. She just has to realize what she gave up and how I could offer her a future instead of Mr. Quick Fix Scott. 

I still love her very much. And my God I miss her... 

I promised myself that I would not talk to her or try to initiate contact for at least two weeks as to not come off as the clingy ex boyfriend. But it's hard...  Oh it's  so hard...

An old friend with whom I had a short fling 5 years ago walked by and I ran out to follow him with my heart pounding in my chest. When he saw me, we looked into eachothers eyes. We had some coffee and just talked, but that look wasn't friendship. He has a girlfriend of 4 years now and they live in another country. 

Background: I have been having some issues with my gf lately. We talked about it. 

I think this moment with this guy can be either one of two things: (1) some things are still not OK with the present relationship and I need to work that shit out, or (2) I feel things for someone else that are real and need to break the fuck up.

When I came back to my boyfriend's place for Christmas with his family, I noticed something he said was odd. Then I found a number of deleted iMessage chats with one of his ex-girlfriends. Dated Dec. 3-9.

He reached out to her first: Hey how's it going?

When she asked him about his relationship with me. He responded: It's going. It sucks. We'll see. 

She said Gotcha

He then asked about her relationship status. And she replied LOL nosey! and then indicated that she doesn't have a boyfriend.

He asked her what she's doing for the weekend.

She said I'd say come over and hang but prob not a good idea. 

He replied saying I think it would be fine. ..... then I'll hit you up tomorrow during the day to see what's up. I would be down for coming over if you're free

/// 

Upon seeing this, I was furious because he dismissed our relationship in front of an ex, inquired about her relationship status before SETTING UP TO MEET HER ALONE AT HER HOME.

He said he was just lonely after I was gone and wanted to catch up. He hasn't talked to her for a year and half, and just wanted to hang. He said he's sorry he faltered. Afterwards he realized that I wouldn't be happy about it, so he didn't meet up with her, ended the conversation, and deleted her number, as well as the numbers of other ex-es.

I said: You have no other friends you can hang out with? I was only gone for less than a week when you reached out to her! If you just want to catch up, couldn't you meet up at a coffee shop or a bar like normal people, why would you arrange to meet up at HER HOME??

He was apologetic. Literally kneeled down on the floor in front of me, telling me how he wasn't planning on cheating on me, nor would he ever wanted to do that, that he was just being stupid. His tears were rolling down as he said he loves me and would do anything for me. He asked me what I want him to do. 

I was shocked by all the emotions and what happened, so I just said block her on facebook and he did. I asked him to show me his phone records from Verizon, and I looked through his phone bills in the past several months, there is no phone call between him and this ex.

Do you think I should believe him and let this one go? Or do you think he's only sorry that he got caught?

---

UPDATE: Afterwards I told him that he needs to slowly earn back my trust. He shouldn't have any contact with any ex at all and shouldn't hang out with any girl alone. 

If any ex texts/facebook/call him, he can only reply with 7 words I don't want any contact with you. Then he can send me a screen shot of what he sent, and keep the message thread for when I come home to show he hasn't had further contact beyond that. 

If an ex is truly remarkable and he wants to stay friends with her, he must introduce us in person to show that it is an open, cordial, and honest friendship with nothing to hide. 

He agreed to all that.

I regret this now, but I kind of neglected my other friendships to be with him so I don't really have many other people to talk to. And then, for the last 4 months or so I needed a place to stay and he offered his place.Since it was summer break and we really didn't have any other commitments we were more or less joined at the hip. I never went more than  a few hours without him. 

I never told him I loved him because by the time I figured it out there were only a few months left before he left and it wasn't really a relationship I was interested in pursuing long-distance. 

But now that he's gone I don't know what to do with myself. I feel like I can't go through my normal breakup procedure of telling myself all the reasons that the guy was bad for me and how much better I can do because... nothing really ever went wrong in our relationship. It was perfect. We didn't have big fights, we were always happy, we went on incredible trips together, but it just had to end due to distance.

Another of my main fears of dating someone is that I don't know how to be a boyfriend. Whether I should spend all my time with this person or give them space and thinking about things like that freak me out. I also don't want to ruin our friendship by asking her out and her saying no or it not working out at all.

He calls me names all the time and tries to grab ass in front of people including our toddler. He has grabbed me so hard by the wrist that It will throb for hours afterwards. He snaps my ass with hand towels when im not expecting it and leaves welts...all the time. He is just abusive and I never realized it until I had someone tell me I deserved better. He smokes pot which I'm not against weed, but it's illegal in my state and I have asked him repeatedly not to do it at home. He just hides his stuff...I know he does it because I found a rezin ball stuck to my couch that my child romps on.

A couple months ago I started speaking to a guy I met in high school. He was a foreign exchange student from Australia. He's 23 and graduated, single, and awesome. I quit talking to him when I got with bf, and he was just pissed off at me for it. I didn't realize that Aussie guy had such strong feelings for me until I told him I had to quit speaking to him...his last words were I wanted to share my life with you and you're doing it with some other guy. Im shattered. I was too stubborn to make a long distance relationship work. There would be weeks and sometimes months of us not talking...but he never stopped thinking about me. So after seeing that message I realized he was very likely worth the trouble of a LDR. I decided to email him and I rekindled with the aussie guy in July and we talk every day. 

I wake up in the middle of the night to chat with him and he stays up until late himself to talk to me. I told him the situation and he's been my rock through this. He's so supportive and just an all around wonderful person. I think about not having him in my life anymore and I can feel this sickening heartbreaking feeling begin to course through my body. Aussie guy and I have taken a more serious turn and he's looking into visiting. We have discussed the future and he's willing to move here eventually when I'm done with my degree. I have very strong feelings for this person and when I look at the feelings I have for my bf, I just think of him as my child's father. I resent him for many things. 


Bf has no idea about this. I don't know how to tell him. Im honestly terrified of telling him and I'm also afraid of the horrendous breakup this will undoubtedly be. I don't sleep in our bed anymore and the thought of even kissing him repulses me.  I have a place to go when this breakup happens. We also have a custody agreement we discussed a long time ago...we will split custody. Hes a good dad and he knows im a good mom...we respect each other enough to agree we both need to stay in daughter's life unless something drastic changes. Aussie guy knows I live with bf still and knows we are together. He tried to be respectful but I instigated everything. This is my fault, I know. I just really want someone to give me advice on how to tell bf, and just any tips, or insight you have to offer. Thank you.

22347,Dating,2z8kbw,"Little background: I (24F) met this guy (call him Ted (30M)) through Tinder last summer. We met, the date was amazing, we have a lot in common and have a great chemistry, like I never had before - and we did not even kissed on first date. A week later we saw eachother again and this went on til third date, where we had sex. During all summer, we saw eachother once in a while, maybe once every 2-3 week. Everytime, he would ask me on dates, then come back to his place. He never ever bootycalled me (nor did I booty called him). But, I would usually leave after we had sex, even though he asked me once to stay the night, which i said no to. That said, sex was great. He would take special care of me and I did too. There was never a time where I felt that he just wanna get laid then go. 

Fast forward a few month, I wanted to be in a stable relationship and he told me he was not ready, which I understood. But 2 months had passed since I decided I was ready to settle down and the moment I met my BF (26M - not relevant). And during this time, I did saw Ted a few times, knowing he was not ready to get in a relationship, and that made me very sad. I would usually come home crying like a little girl. A few time I told myself I would stop seeing him, but he always got the right words to keep me with him. 

I then met a guy, and stopped seeing Ted, and we were BF/GF for a few months, until a few weeks ago. I had stop seeing Ted since the very first day I met my ex-BF. Ted had not stop texting me during the time of my relationship, taking news of myself, school, my mom (who is sick) and more, about twice a month. At one point, I just stopped answering his texts and I blocked him on facebook because I felt it was serious with my now-ex-BF.

Last week, he texted me, taking news, asking things about my life that I did not even remembered saying him. He listened to me and remembered every thing I have ever said to him in the last year. He texts me everyday, asks me about everything, school, jobs, my family. We talked a bit, and he told me how he was messed up last summer, how he WAS not ready to settle down with a girl. That really strucked me. He asks me if I was still in a relationship and I told him I was recently single. We agreed to go take a drink tonight.

But I don't know what to think: last summer, we had something really nice but he was not ready. Can seeing me with an other man made him realised he wanted to give it a try? Is that possible? Or its the longest con ever to get in my pants (again)? 

Note: He's average looking. I don't think I am the only girl he got in the last year. I think that if he really wants to get laid that bad, he could go back to Tinder and find a girl that would be willing to.

TL;DR: Can a girl go from FWB to GF in a man's mind?

**UPDATE!** Someone asked for an update, so here it is. Yesterday we were suppose to go grab a drink, something we would usually before going to his place (last year). He called me a few hours prior to the date and ask me if I want to go see a movie and maybe have dinner after. I was thrilled, that is surely something we never done when we were FWB. We met, the movie was ok, but he laught a lot, we had a great time. The dinner was amazing, he made me discover a new restaurant in the area, I loved it. Troughout the night, he never stopped kissing me - during the movie, when we got out, in the car, in the line for the restaurant, everywhere. He never kissed me in public before: maybe once or twice when we had a drink at a bar, but never nearly as much as yesterday. So we both went home *on our own* and that's it. No sex. Am I wrong if I think it means alot?! Anyway, I am really thrilled, I think he stepped up his game, new dates, lots of kisses, no sex - definitly not the relationship we had last year :)

So after being ignored by her for a week now, she sent me a giant text at midnight describing that she was breaking up with me. She refuses to talk to my face about it. This is the part that has me so blindsided, the fact that me and her were going strong, she always told me that she's the happiest she's ever been, that she will always love me and nothing will change. Then she got the stupid birth control implant and it literally was 180 degree change. Her mom told me that she's depressed and not herself since getting the implant and that I need to talk to her. Do I have any hope? By giving her some space, and time to adjust to the depression and the hormones, will I ever get my baby back? Someone please give e some hope!

I honest to god, fell in love with someone. A feeling I've NEVER experienced ever in past relationships. That feeling that, no matter how shitty your day tries to be, that one person makes it the best day. The feeling where all you want to do is give, and give, and give everything you have because it makes you happy when they are happy. The feeling that the only possession you need in life is the other person. Just pure love from the heart.

22361,Dating,3clk6i,"So I met a girl at a time in both of our lives where we were unhappy with our relationships. I ended mine shortly after meeting her because I realized how unhappy I was and that there were other girls in the world that I could connect with on a deep level. She however, remained in hers. Over the course of 2 months we talked more and more frequently, to the point that she went from emotionally cheating on her boyfriend with me to physically cheating as well.

We connected very deeply emotionally. We understood what the other was thinking at most times and could communicate to each other what we could not do with anyone else. Our conversations were exhilarating and liberating as we could both speak to each other without fear of judgement or reprisal. 2 months ago, her now ex discovered that she was cheating and terminated the relationship.

I am not providing excuses for her, but the relationship she was in was emotionally abusive. The month succeeding the breakup was filled with me providing support and a shoulder to cry on as she tried to do what she could to restart her failed relationship. However, it wasn't all doom and gloom. This was interspersed with truly fun and engaging events such as us going hiking and watching the NBA/NHL finals. We talked daily and saw each other at least once or twice a week. It is difficult to describe the connection between us. It is one of those relationships you find in life that hits you like lightning. The relationship I left lasted for 6 years. I know what infatuation feels like. This is girl does not fit that bill. We always had fun together whether it was as simple as talking on my porch, going out drinking, staying home playing board games, or finding exciting places to hike and explore.

Two weeks ago she finally got her head on straight regarding her previous relationship. She recognized that is not what she wanted and has finally mentally moved on. However, two days ago we were talking about where we stand in our relationship. She knows that I want something official. However, she isn't sure that I am what she wants. She loves that I see her for exactly who she is, that she always has fun when she is with me, and that we can talk with such ease. Yet, she has reservations about a relationship because she usually dates guys with super high energy levels whereas I am more even-keel. She knows that I am always willing to go out and do something, but I am not the life of the party and I do not generate large levels of excitement in other people. So, she has come to the conclusion that she wants some distance to continue to figure out what she wants in life, and to possibly date other people.

Logically, I view the relationship between her and me as something that will not come to be. Yet, emotionally, I know how deeply she cares for me and actually wants to be with me, but can't figure out if that high energy she has historically preferred is something that she truly requires in a relationship. During our final talk I identified that I am not going to wait for her.

Now that I have distanced myself a few days from our final discussion, I have second thoughts about the whole situation. Do I reach out to her and pose a mandate to choose me or someone else right now? That at this stage if she doesn't know how she feels about me that this isn't something that is going to work? Or is it possible she could genuinely need a reference to gauge if my personality is what she truly wants? What experiences have people had where someone asked to date others? Did the relationship fizzle or did the other party come back with a new perspective? I do not think that she would do this to me, but I cannot ignore the possibility that she will look around and say well, there is nothing better as opposed to he is what I truly want. Personally, I do not understand why she thinks she should date other people. But, our relationship to this point has been based on communication and acceptance, so I have given her the space she has asked of me. Have I just given her an easy way out of an otherwise difficult discussion? Or is there a possibility that someone who has been in an abusive 4 year relationship can't figure out what she really wants, and needs perspective to determine precisely what she is looking for?

Believe me when I say that I look at this situation and all I can think of is that despite how much fun we had, how well we connected, that I am not what she wants and that is that. Am I being delusional in still believing that she genuinely needs to back up for perspective? Has anyone else had experience with or known somebody who has been in a similar situation?

tl;dr: A girl that is unlike any other I've met, who I'm head over heels for, wants to date other people to gauge if my personality is truly what she wants, or if she needs what she has traditionally sought. Do I confront her about the logic of this, or let things play out and hope she realizes that what I have given her over the past few months is what she truly desires?","Me [26 M] with my romantic interest [28 F] of 4 months, wants to date other people",0.0,False,2.0,2.0,1436390088.0,/r/relationships/comments/3clk6i/me_26_m_with_my_romantic_interest_28_f_of_4/,Romantic

Part of me wants too, but the other part doesn't because I don't know how she could expect us to be just friends after everything that has happened between us. If she was talking to someone for a year, then she shouldn't have got serious with someone else then expect to go back to being just friends.

22374,Breakups,2c4f4h,"Long time reader, first time poster. My girlfriend Lauren and I have been dating for a little over 2 years. We met during her last year of high school and dated through the summer and the next year before going to the same university. During this time we lived together and things went really well. However, I realized that I wanted to do a different program, and that required me to move to a new city (that would put us a very expensive distance apart). 

It was easy to say we'd do long distance when we lived together. Now not so much. I've noticed there is a huge communication problem when we talk online. I won't get a response for hours at a time, or messages will be ignored. We had a talk about this and agreed it was a problem that need to be worked on. 

Things got better, but in that time I realized I'm just not equipped to deal with this kind of relationship emotionally. We barely fight in person, but online our arguments are faceless and bitter. I can't feel any connection or love this way. I just get stressed and sad. It's not really a relationship so much as a promise there will be one when two people finally live in the same place.

She has four years left of school in her city and I have two. I won't be able to find work in her city, so moving back there isn't an option. She has ruled out transferring schools as well. There's no real end date to the time we'll be apart. I love this woman, but it's like the universe is telling us no.

So we come to now, and I honestly just don't know what to do.  Originally, our plan was to enjoy the summer together and just say goodbye when we started school again. But now she's moving early, to go live up with a friend 5 hours away because she's unhappy with her home life. This was a very sudden decision. We agreed to attempt doing long distance during the month she'd be living with her friend. When she comes back we'll only have a day or two to see each other before leaving again to start school. 

We've also been spending a lot of time together lately and we're in a really good place emotionally (we are, of course, in the same town) I just don't know what the right call is here for us.

TL;DR: Having trouble deciding what to do when my girlfriend and I go our separate ways. I don't think I can do long distance and be happy, but the thought of us breaking up makes me feel really shitty.

* Do we see how long distance goes now and then make a decision?

22375,Dating,1o2nmb,"Okay so my girlfriend and I have been dating for two months now. We went to the same high school, but did not really talk much. Over the previous summer we got to talking and became best of friends and decided to take it to the next level. We spent literally every day with one another and it's almost as if we lived together. We knew it would be difficult since we go to different Universities that are not very close to one another. The distance is managable and we try to see each other as often as possible (once every weekend or two), but she is very involved in sports and academia, so she says she never really has her phone on her or when she does, she can not answer. However, last weekend was the first time in three weeks that we have seen one another, and pretty much the whole time we were together she was on her phone. I know it shouldn't really get to me, but for me a relationship is nothing without communication. She never really answers my texts, calls, or snap chats, but when I'm with her she is non-stop on her phone. I don't know how to feel about this. I love this girl and I trust her but  just don't know what's up, and I don't want to be wasting my time in  a relationship that is going nowhere.


Another thing that gets to me is whenever we go out or party, she gets really close to other guys. She's very touchy and talkative but I'm afraid one of these nights when I'm no there one of those guys is going to try to do something with her, not knowing that she has a boyfriend. I trust enough that she will be faithful but there is this ever underlying sense of doubt in the back of my mind, that is just made worse by the distance and the fact that you can never be sure of anything. Whenever I bring anything like this up to her, she'll always come up with the same answer, Do you trust me? Of course I do, but at the same time it's really hard to when she's giving these signs that she doesn't want to talk to me.


This leads me to believe either she is just bored when we are together so she has to be on her phone o pass time, or she is lying and has her phone and just chooses not to reply, which sucks because I love talking to her and she knows that.

She flips out, calling me selfish, and I spend the rest of the morning keeping her company because she's drunk and can't drive her car and doesn't want to head back to her house and have her parents see her in that state. We continue to have our discussion but based on our mindset, it's not productive and degenerates quickly.


We give each other time to sleep off the booze and talk again the day after. We lay a lot of things out on the table. What went wrong the last time, etc. We both clarified a few things about the past, when we were coming from when we said things that hurt the other. Why we both acted the way we did. It was a good 4 hours of clearing the air. Based on what she said regarding things she wished I'd done back when we were serious and things she's glad I've learned now, I think some feelings are still there. But obviously there are some issues between us still left to be addressed (she did not get along with my sister and I didn't step into defend her when my sister was being a bitch). I tell her that I still have feelings and that I still think they're going to complicate things between us if we're Just Friends. Her response was  I hope this doesn't end badly.


I'm going to pursue her again because, well. I wanted her the first time and I don't wan't to let her slip away again... Just how badly is my heart going to get crushed?

22377,Dating,2for0j,"I am 18 F trying to start a relationship with a friend who is 18 M.  We have been meeting on the weekends for a few months now.  We see each other about once per week outside of classes to talk about things that we decide to read in our spare time (kind of like a book club, but it's just the two of us in a little library study room).  I think he's great, and he seems really pleasant and is always open to hanging out more (pretty much the only times he has ever said no to hanging out is when there's a big test or he literally has a class at the time I ask about).  We haven't kissed or anything, but that's probably because I don't make moves like that unless I'm pretty much positive that the guy will be receptive to avoid making it awkward.  I do make attempts to flirt, but as I don't have a lot of experience with it, I'm not sure that he gets the idea.

Anyway, I would really like to ask him about being in an exclusive relationship (boyfriend/girlfriend), but every time that I go into one of our meetings with the mindset to ask, I always back out at the last second.  I usually get too nervous and just frantically think to myself of how hurt I would be if he turned me down.  Afterwards for sure I think of how happy I would be if he said yes, but I can never bring myself to make it to outweigh the fear in the moment.  Should I try to just keep flirting with (at?  :P) him until he gets the message, or should I just force myself to blurt it out at some point?  Something else that I haven't thought of, maybe?  Let me know what you think would be helpful, either to get over my mental block of asking him myself, or in getting him the message more clearly.

22378,Dating,2oo1om,"I met a girl over the summer and we have been talking and hanging out for about 6 months now. She lives out of state so we don't see each other very often but would text or Snapchat pretty much daily.  

Very early on I asked her if she wanted to go on a date but she said she wasn't in a place where she was going to get involved with anyone at the time but that she was interested in me.  That was enough for me to stick around and see if anything ever progressed.

Things felt like they were progressing until about a month and a half ago which was about a week after I had last visited her for the weekend. She seemed more distant and the flirting stopped but chalked it up to being busy with school and work. In these past couple weeks I had come to accept that she wasn't into me and was preparing myself to let her go and move on.

Just this past weekend I was visiting some friends and was within a couple hours of where she lived so I asked her if she wanted to meet up.  I went to see her last night and when I went in for a kiss, which was nothing new, but she dodged it and said we needed to talk.  She again said that she was not in a place to be in a relationship and said she never knew if she would be and asked me if that was ok.  I said it was not but that we could talk about it later since it was already really late and she was trying to go to bed.  

I was planning on staying there but after a couple minutes I decided I couldn't and would make the 4+ hour drive back home in the middle of the night.  I went to her room and told her I was going to leave but we needed to talk later.  She then broke down and told me why.  She told me that earlier in the year before we had met she was raped by a friend and had tried to kill herself after.  We talked for awhile longer and ultimately I decided to leave that night and drive home.  I couldn't stay at her place and be left with my thoughts.

I still am in complete shock and horror for what she has and is going through.  Having someone that I care for so deeply go through this is the worst thing I have ever had to deal with and it's nowhere near as bad as what she is going through.  I don't know what to do. I was prepared and even started ended ties with her because I couldn't deal with not having my feelings reciprocated. I completely understand why she doesn't want to get involved now and I feel like a huge selfish asshole for wanting to cut it off with her.

I know it must have been extremely difficult for her to tell me and now I am one of only a handful people who know and that she sees and really close true friends.  This is something that should bring friends closer but I fear my feelings for her are making it drive us apart. I want to continue to be her friend and be there for her and help her in anyway that I can. I just don't know if I can deal or how to deal with my feelings for her or in what ways I can help her.

I texted her when I got home this morning and told her how amazing she was and that I would be there for her.  I texted her again after I woke up and processed things a bit more just to see how she was doing and saying that she and I should talk soon.  No response yet.


She has been receiving counselling and is doing a lot better and vows to not let this control her life.

I've been in and out of having feelings for her throughout that time but recently we've had really good chemistry and I thought she was being overly touchy with me compared to normal so I decided I would just ask her out on a date, which I did and she happily accepted.

But during the time leading up to the date, I got the feeling that she thought it was just hanging out between friends, which we never really did without other friends before. I decided to play it safe and not really try to push anything. I thought both of us had a great time at the date and she mentioned a few things that would indicated that it was a date, but she wasn't really initiating contact like before.

Today, I decided I was just going to go for it and ask her out explicitly for another date, but I got insider info (gossip) from another friend that she may be interested in another guy that she met in between the date and today. At this point, I don't know what to do. I want to get my feelings out there but I also don't want to ruin a good friendship with a lot of mutual friends.

One of the apps he had open was Tinder, and I had only heard about it, I didn't really know what it was besides an app for dating and sex.

In hindsight I feel like a dick for being that confusing and unclear, but at the time I was drunk with good intentions.

The reason I didn't make a move is that I've had several experiences mixing work and dating in multiple ways in the past, and it's always ended from awkward to pretty horrible.

I get on really well with her sister (my colleague), but I work with her closely every day and her personality type is that if anything went sour between myself and her sister, there's only one side she's taking and logic wouldn't be involved in that decision (others have agreed I made a good move on that basis). 

That would make my work situation really uncomfortable. Even the lingering thought that my colleague knows what's going on in my dating life to that extent is distracting in my day to day work life.

22389,Breakups,1iusi4,"I was in a relationship for two years with someone who I thought was an amazing, caring, compassionate person. His dad was in his 60s and had a major stroke due to ongoing heart problems. While his dad was in the hospital I supported my ex as much as he would allow. I spent time with him in the hospital and helped out where I could. I was his first major relationship and the first (and last) girlfriend to ever meet his father. His dad even asked to see me while in the hospital and told my ex how much he appreciated that I was there and basically gave his overall approval of me. Soon after, his dad died.

I took some time off of school to support him. But after this, my ex basically turned into the world's biggest asshole and pretty much directed all of his assholery toward me. At first, I figured this was grieving and didn't do much about it, but he kept pushing me away. I wouldn't hear from him for days. When we would talk, we would argue. I was living in downtown Chicago and would visit him in the suburbs every weekend, but he would never be available or would just ignore me. He would go out with new friends that he made and never invite me. 

He would tell me that his friends thought I was a bitch and that none of them liked me. He would have one on one lunches/dinners with all these new girls that he was meeting and most of his existing friends, who also happen to be his ex girlfriends.

He has a habit of talking behind people's backs. A friend of mine dubbed him the Male Regina George because that's basically how he acts. He's sweet to your face, but he'll call you a slut behind your back. He would often call his female friends sluts/whores and the like. He would also say mean things about his guy friends as well.

He'd blame all of his problems on me. I was becoming a shell of myself and making too many excuses for his behavior so I broke up with him (over the phone, because he refused to make time to see me).

Basically, for a year we kept getting back together, then breaking up. He was working to help support his family now and didn't have a lot of time, but he had begun seeing a therapist and genuinely trying not to fall back into how he was before.

Last year I decided to move to Los Angeles for a school program. At first he was really supportive, he claimed he was considering law school and would look at schools in the area and made me believe he was seriously thinking about moving out here with me. Well my program ended and he was supposed to visit for spring break but he didn't read his classes' syllabus (syllabi?) and asked for the wrong week off of work. Seriously? How hard is it to look online/read a fucking piece of paper to know when your spring break is? 

I was over it. I was over waiting for him, setting aside all my time for him, getting my hopes up for him. That was it. I didn't talk to him for a while because I was angry. We had been calling each other more recently, he would tell me how he misses me and he loves me still, but I could tell something was up between him and this girl, who happened to have ferociously flirted with him while we were together AND my ex would make fun of her and call her a whore because she cheated on her fiance. So I asked him if he was dating her and he told me no. I find out later from a friend that he has been seeing her for a while.

So I got really angry. I sent him angry messages, emails, texts, etc. The fact that he lied about being with her AND strung me along telling me he misses/loves me drove me crazy. I'm still really angry. Up until this point, I had always felt like, if anything, he was always honest. 

I'm really lost right now. I'm still extremely angry and I can't really deal with this because I can't talk to my ex or vent at him. After all that I've been through with him, I feel I deserved better treatment than this. I haven't been single in a long time and I don't know how to act really. I've dated a little, but I find that a lot of guys are childish and I come with a lot of baggage. I'm angry and lonely and the person I used to confide in is now my worst enemy. 

I want to move back to Chicago, but I'm not ready to be anywhere near him. When I come home for holidays, I'm extremely upset. I can't even enjoy Christmas because home reminds me of him and the Christmases we spent together. I don't know how to deal with this. I'm angry more than anything else and I don't know how to stop being so angry.

22400,Breakups,3gb6uc,"Hi r/relationships. I come to you because reddit has always been there for me over the years and I really need help at the moment.

I have been in an on again off again relationship with a girl from the time I was 13 years old. The relationship really got serious about 2 and a half years ago and we were dating officially for that amount of time. 

For the past 2 years, there have been lots of ups and downs. She has always been a very needy person and didn't like me to have friends, but because I was so infatuated with her, this hardly bothered me and I dedicated myself to her.

In 2014, we were at university together (but living separately) and it was the best year of my life. We got to learn who we were as a couple when we were no longer in high school or restricted by our parents, etc.

At the beginning of 2015, we planned to live together and were moving into an apartment together. Over the university holidays between 2014 and 2015, we didn't see a lot of each other (both of us were at fault), and it ended up putting a slight tension and distance between us. She was unable to handle this as she had forgotten how in love we were, and when we first moved in, she broke up with me. 

At the time, this crushed me but I could tell it was hurting her so much more, so I comforted her. I decided to leave and move back home with my parents, while she also decided to do this after trying to stay there by herself, which didn't work out.

Once we were both at home, we continued talking and sparks fired again and the relationship started back up again (like it had many times over the 7 years). She decided that she needed to find herself and went overseas to do that. Whilst she was overseas we kept the relationship going and things got fairly serious. We both missed each other and I was really excited for her to come back, and was planning to take her away and show her what we used to be like.

Then, things turned to shit. She came back to the country without telling me for a week. My plans of going to the airport to greet her were crushed. But from here, it just got worse. Somewhere in between coming back to the country and telling me she was back, her mentality towards our relationship had completely changed. She decided that I was holding her back and that she needed to sort out her own life since she had thrown university away, etc.

However, instead of telling me this and asking me to let her to do this or help her to do this, she begun ignoring me completely. Whilst she was overseas, we managed to talk everyday, despite the time difference. It went from everyday contact to maybe she would reply once every 3 days. This upset me as I did not understand what was going on as she had not told me what was happening with us. 

In this time, instead of just working on herself and finding her feet, she started talking to another guy who she had history with during our relationship (fucked up story here). This was about a month ago from what I can gather. 

When she started ignoring me, I queried her to tell me if she had moved on and if there was someone else, and I constantly got 'no'. I was lied to about her talking to any other guys, as I believed it was just me. 

Now this guy. He is a scumbag who uses girls for his own desires with no regards for them. She has moved onto him (note that she still hasn't told me what the hell happened or even explicitly broke it off), but she has had sex with him in the short time span of a month, while I'm left trying to understand what happened since I've been given no closure.

The whole situation just seems so cruel to me. If she had have told me that it was over, I could have moved on with my life, but right now I'm absolutely crushed and crying everyday because I'm still in love with her and can't even see the idea of moving on, even though she already has.

I just don't know what to do. 

So that's why I've come to you reddit. Maybe someone else out there has been in a similar situation or has some advice. Even if nobody replies, I guess it just helps to get it out.

22404,Dating,3amy03,"Been meaning to ask for advice on this for a while and this is the first time I'm writing this entire story out for a bunch of strangers on the internet. I'm warning you it's really long. Here goes:


This has been consistently in the back of my mind for the past 2-3 years since I started talking to this girl (let's call her Erika).
Here’s our history/friendship summed up:


**2013**

I (16M at the time) met this girl, Erika (14F at the time) back in February 2013. We had a “thing” but nothing ever came from it. She ended up “dating” her best friend Brett (at the time) after going on a school trip together (but he lived in France so it ended up being some long distance bullshit).


I got pissed that she ditched our thing for a guy who lived in a totally different continent and moved on to another girl. Erika and I started talking again though in the summer of 2013. She broke up with Brett and I realized I still had some feelings for her and she might have some for me. I broke up with the girl and ended up getting really close to Erika and waited for an opening. 


**2013-2014**

We ended up being best friends and seeing as there was no chance/opening, in the winter of 2013-2014 I straight up told her I was giving up (on the romantic side of things) and things were a little off for a week or so but we went back to best friends.


Things got good but in the summer of 2014 I regretted my decision of giving up and realized I still had feelings so I straight up told her that last winter I was an idiot and that I would still do anything to date her but she didn’t feel the same way. We stopped talking for a month or so and I started dating a new girl, Kayleigh.


Erika and I got really close during my relationship with Kayleigh and talked about literally everything, including the things I did with and how Kayleigh and I moved super fast (she always wanted “the details”). We got really close physically too, getting kinda cuddly and stuff quite often, be it on bus rides or just lying on my small ass single bed (but **I never crossed the line**).


**2015**

Kayleigh broke up with me in January 2015 and that’s when Erika and I got closer than ever. Talking almost every day, seeing each other at least once or twice a week, going to parties together (one at which she got really drunk and tried to kiss me twice but I backed off because it felt wrong with her in her drunken state).


We often go on just walks in the park or she comes over/i go to her house and we just chill on my/her bed/couch. We see movies together, go for dinner, etc.


I’ve never been this close to a girl without it being romantic and it weirds me out. Like we get cuddly and stuff.


Twice we’ve gotten annoying people to stop chasing us by pretending to date (kinda weird I know). We’re super close and I’m 100% sure I have feelings for Erika right now. She is moving to France in a year for university and I don’t know if she’s going to come back. Do I try to make a move now and risk our friendship again?


I would rather know that we tried and failed at a relationship of sorts rather than be stuck with a “what if” feeling when she’s gone.


She’s going on vacation for a month in a week from now as well.

She is constantly playing the guilt card, is overall way too emotional, and she is clingy beyond belief. We are each other's first everything. I cannot deal with her anymore, despite talking to her about these things multiple times. She promised she'd change for the better, but there are still no signs of improvement.

 My question is... how exactly do I do this? I have never had to break up with anyone, and I know this is going to absolutely crush her and bring her to tears for weeks. I feel like if I see her get upset, I will feel bad and take it back.

 Also, how do you deal with telling your family members you broke up? My whole family loves her, and my dad asks me at least once or twice a day when she is coming over. Obviously this is the least of my concerns, but it is still a thought nonetheless.

22407,Dating,31j80g,"Hello everyone. Long time lurker and only recently have started getting into the dating game (super late bloomer). I’ve got a long story.  One of my first little crushes and I need some advice. I have a somewhat flirty relationship with a coworker and I am not sure if I should progress the relationship or not as I do not want to hurt her.  


First a little backstory.

I've recently moved across seas for the chance to live abroad for the first time and took up a training position. I was planning to stay for about a year then go back. 


Another trainee is a girl that I work very closely with. She is cute, but I am only somewhat physically attracted to her. She seems to be attracted to me, but I am horrible at picking up signs. Regardless, our personalities match up pretty well. We are both pretty dorky, introverts who watch TV shows and play video games, both those people in your group who are cute clutz' and way to easy to make fun of, we listen to the same music, and we like to argue way past other people's limits.


I am against getting into a relationship with a coworker. We are part of a larger group of trainees and I didn't want to alienate ourselves since everyone was from abroad. I also do not like the thought of breaking up and having to work extremely close.


Nothing has happened between us. We are friendly and hang out while at work. In the beginning, she seemed to make shy advances, or it could just be me misinterpreting things. I tried to make it as plutonic as possible though. She would invite all of the trainees out to the movies, but it would end up being just us two. We ended up going to a music event together. We planned with a third, but he ended up not being able to go. She comes to my desk all the time and likes to steal food. General office stupid flirty stuff.


Flash forward to the end of the training. I am leaving the company. I feel like I know her much better and have developed a little crush. Now that we won’t be working together, I am thinking of asking her out. However, I’ve also waited until a pretty terrible time. I will have to return home in a month. I am unsure if I will be able to stay overseas (depends on job situation) but I am trying to stay for another year (will almost definitely go home after that). It’s a pretty hectic time for me right now with job searching and “Life Choices.” I am unsure if I should ask her out now. Is it too late? I also do not want to leave and hurt her if things do get serious.



**tl;dr**: Mandatory summary/question!
Coworker has a crush on me. I made it a plutonic relationship. Now I am leaving the company 2/3 of a year later and would like to ask her out. Problem is I am leaving the country in a month.

22408,Infidelity,27uxlx,"My bf, Brian, and I have been together for 10 months now, it’s pretty serious. We plan on moving in together next year, have talked about marriage, etc. I love him very much and I am absolutely sure I want to spend the rest of my life with him.

3 months into our relationship I cheated on him. It was a onetime thing. I went out for drinks with my roommate and her friends and I ended up sleeping with one of the guys (friend of my roommate) that was out with us, let’s call him Mike. I will probably never see Mike again, he is in the military, currently overseas and isn’t in town very much, I met him that night we went out and that was it. Not even my roommate realized what happened between Mike and I, we all got incredibly drunk (which I know is not an acceptable excuse). Everyone that was out that night ended up sleeping over at our apartment, and I made sure Mike made his way to the couch before anyone woke up.

I decided at the time it was better if I didn’t tell my bf about it, I felt disgusted with myself and have sworn never to put myself in that kind of situation again. I think about it every day, how stupid I was to do such an awful thing. The guilt and regret I feel can be very overwhelming to the point where I sometimes start crying thinking about what I did. I can get myself under control pretty quickly but lately I haven’t been able to stop thinking about it. I am so ashamed of what I did, I haven’t told anyone about it. Not a single person other than Mike knows about this.

Brian is the most loving, caring person I’ve ever been with. I hate myself for betraying him. I know that if I tell him what happened it will break his heart and ruin what we have together. I not only cheated on him but I lied and kept it from him all this time. I’m scared he will never forgive me for it and I will lose him if I tell him about it.

22419,Breakups,23mct9,"So my girlfriend and I broke up a month ago. Without going super into detail, she told me she wasn't happy with herself and she needs to be happy before she can be in a relationship. She told me that she could see herself ending up with me and she loves me more than anything but she needed this right now. We didn't even fight when we broke up. I've felt like I've done everything to the best of my ability to do everything right.

The worst thing I did was cry in front of her and asked her if we could not do this and maybe I shouldn't have done this but I really couldn't hold in my emotions at the time. But we both cried. I've been understanding and told her I'm always here for her and told her at the time that I thought we were supposed to be together. 

I've gave her space like she needed and fast forward until about a week ago I texted her and told her that I loved her. She never responded but I let it go. Now Easter comes and I wished her a happy Easter but she never responded to that either. I'm just so confused on why she couldn't at least wished me a happy Easter. I was just trying to be kind. I've only texted her about 4 times this last month and I just don't know what to do.

I took the breakup kind of hard but I've been feeling better now and I do want her back but I just don't know what to do. I've given the space but I don't want to give too much space where I'm ignoring her. I've been told to play the game to ignore her, make her jealous, etc but this seems so childish to me. If I have to play high school games to win her back then it's not worth it.

I'm coming here as a last resort. I've dealt with depression for a lot of my life and I've felt I've don't everything in the best of my ability to be understanding right now. I guess the hardest part is I feel like I'm being punished and ignored for something I didn't do. Any thoughts anyone?

Edit: I forgot to say I did send her flowers about a week after our breakup if that's meaningful.

22424,Dating,2li0gg,"I'm hoping someone can shed some light on this for me. I know it's only been two months but we already decided on exclusivity and it's going really well.

Met this guy online, we talked for a few weeks before meeting up. Our first date ended up being an entire weekend, and since then we have spent each weekend together since and usually spend a few days during the week together as well. Our relationship is moving ahead pretty well, except for one thing: the way he shows affection, and the way I desire affection.

I like verbal affirmation. I like to hear that I'm doing well, and that I'm pretty, and successful, and talented. Being able to hear someone I love tell me that they're proud of me is one of the best feelings I can imagine. It might be because I was severely verbally abused at home as a child, bullied in school, and words (or lackthereof) have always hurt (he doesn't know about any of this). The truth is, I love hearing how wonderful I am. I have no trouble accepting positive affirmation, and I am always gracious and thankful when someone compliments me. Sometimes it seems that I don't want anything from a partner besides their happiness, faith, loyalty, and to hear their encouraging words.

One day, a few weeks into our relationship, I still had not heard him tell me I was pretty, so I asked him if he thought I was attractive. He said yes, he thought I was really beautiful, but that he has a tough time verbalizing his feelings for people he cares about and he does everything through actions. When I didn't realize is that he would have *such* a tough time complimenting me. Even to tell me I'm pretty it just seems like he's grasping at straws and pulling random words out of the air, so it ends up being something like you have a nice face situation, I really like it, it's kinda really pretty, and it is really starting to affect my feelings towards the relationship. He tells me I'm amazing and sexy when we're having sex, he tells me when I look good and smell good, and I will get a pretty lady or cutie sometimes. I'm actually starting to cry because he has no trouble telling me a celebrity, or a co-worker, or a blonde girl at Target is really pretty (and they're always really pretty!), but he can't tell me -- and I'm rarely so petty about things, so it makes me feel really stupid to be so insecure (especially after he explained the way he show someone he cares). We have a ton in common, always laugh, and I do think he really likes me, because he is always making weekend plans by Wednesday, buying everything when we go out, holding my hand, cooking me dinner, and he even welded a new seat for his favorite motorcycle so we could go for a ride.

Is there a way to bring this up without seeming needy or clingy? I feel pretty needy. Does he just not think I'm pretty? I know that he will be ok with whatever I say and we can talk about it more, but I'm afraid that I'm not sure how to ask that he just tell me that I'm pretty without all the fluff. Whenever I think about it, the emotional part of my brain just overwhelms my rational side and I would just end up being a grump about it and saying something negative.

TL;DR: He says he's bad with words with people he cares about, has trouble complimenting me, but has no trouble complimenting other people. Is this a thing that people who are bad at communicating their feelings do, or does he just think that I'm not pretty?

22426,Infidelity,2tiq5f,"My girlfriend (lets call her Susie) and I have been together for almost a year now and I just found out night that she cheated on me about six months ago. 

Lets jump back for a second. She dated this guy (lets call him Bob) for a very brief time about four years ago but the relationship came to a quick end because he cheated on her. 

Jump back to six months ago, which happens to be our six month anniversary. Susie and I are hanging out and grabbing a couple drinks and whatnot. She already seemed like she was hiding something, I remember. She wasn't quite acting like herself but she claimed she was fine. After a couple drinks I wanted to go home with her which is what happens pretty much every night. However, she says she wants to call it a night because she is tired or something along those lines. It was a rainy night so I asked her to text me when she got home and she did. She hinted that she was going to bed by saying 'goodnight' or something along those lines. 

So I'm at home and she… she is at home? Anyway, she is at home lets say and Bob is persistent about seeing her. He has been persistent for the few days he has been in town. Susie kind of wanted to see him while he was in town but hadn't had time yet because of work and whatnot. Anyway, persistence pays off and she makes plans with Bob to meet up at a nearby bar and go immediately to her place.

A few nights after Bob went to her place, she tells me about it and it turns into a whole fight. Tears and all. The only thing is, she only told me that he came over and all they did was talk. I was hurt that she left me on our six month anniversary to hang out with an ex boyfriend but at least nothing happened, right? It took me a few days to get over it but we were back to normal.

A few months later Susie and are talking, and I forget how exactly, but that night with Bob comes up again. She says that Bob tried to kiss her. Now this wasn't in the original story. We were on a nice vacation and had a romantic night planned so I didn't want to turn it into a fight so I just kind of brushed it off. I guess a little part of me assumed he tried to make a move on her but I trusted that she turned him down.

Fast forward to last night. We've been fighting recently and on the verge of a breakup. I guess Susie feels she needs to get it off her chest and she tells me she cheated on me. She 'supposedly' tells me everything that happened that night. 

Here was what happened.

After her and I went our separate ways, she and Bob meet up at a bar near her place and go back to her place from there. They sit down on her couch in the living room and get to talking and he goes to kiss her. She doesn't stop him. She lets him kiss her. She tells me he was a loose end and she needed to see if she truly loved me or if there was still something with him. She said she new immediately that this was the wrong decision and that she wanted to be with me and only me.

I've never felt the pain of being cheated on. It is awful. And on top of being cheated on, I was lied to. What do I do? I don't want to love her but I do still. At least for now. Can I trust her? Should I give her another chance? After all, I was planning on spending my life with her.

22430,Breakups,1p9s85,"**Quick background on our relationship**: I knew her in high school but we didn't talk. I always looked forward to seeing her. One day I realize she isn't there anymore, but don't think much about it. Eventually, I had a dream about her and I knew I was in love with her at that point. I told her about it and we started texting, writing letters back and forth, etc. She was in a relationship at that point but never talked to her boyfriend and hadn't seen him in like three months. 

Finally we meet at a party and it was incredibly awkward, until we both relaxed and then we stayed up like all night. Things continued that way and we dated for about 1.5 years (2 years of contact total). 

Then one day she wants to go meet up with her old friend she had been talking to. This old friend is a partier, lotsa tattoos etc., and also best friends with her ex boyfriend. After the first time they hung out, I knew things were different. She would talk to her friend a lot and hung out a lot and I saw less and less of her. 

**Breaking up**: 

She started talking about breaking up and saying her depression and health issues (both actually real) were too much to handle and she didn't want to date. Everytime she told me though, she would cry and say she didn't want to break up and we would agree not to. She also said she just wanted to work through those problems and get together with me again. 

I cling to her like crazy while going through an incredibly hard time. We talk less and less and I blur the lines of the breakup by deluding myself that we are still together in a sense. Eventually it's clear she is with her ex again, but when I bring it up she angrily denies it. 

I've had enough and I'm done, she still wants to talk but only when she is sad, I say no and block her from everything and unfollow her blog. There was a lot of weird back and forth her caring about me and wanting to continue a dialogue but me being anxious and depressed when I check her blog and see pictures of her ex or her lusting after sex. 

**Currently**

Recently I got drunk and wrote her a long letter about how what she did was wrong. She shouldn't have lied to me about being with her ex. She should have made it clear we were broken up. I should have realized everything sooner. etc. 

A week or two pass and she texts me saying she needs to talk because she is depressed and losing it. I battle being supportive or telling her to fuck off. End up taking the high road with an inbetween, sorry I can't do this to myself. I can't just tell you while you are great and make you happy and then feel like maybe something is back only to go check your blog and see you submitting naked photos or you with your boyfriend. She says ok, and we end it. 

It has been like three weeks since then and I still can't stop thinking about her. I'm trying not to look at her blog, and I haven't. I still dream about her a lot, usually we get back together. I don't know what to do. Although it causes me pain and anxiety and sadness, I am addicted to a drug, and that drug is her. 

I would appreciate advice or your own similar stories. 

**TL;DR**: We date for two-ish years, she hangs out once with old best friend and everything changes. She changes as well and wants a new life. Halfway breaks up me under the guise of depression and health issues. Both issues are real but that didn't stop her from dating her ex (who is best friends with her old best friend). She occasionally contacts me, cares about me, and will talk to me when she is really depressed. I have stopped caving in and have stopped looking at her blog but I think about her once every few minutes whenever I let my mind wander. It won't stop.

We started dating in our college marching band, with an extremely passionate, loving relationship, that understandable grew into a deeper companionship and less honeymoon-y. Then my mom was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer. He did not handle it well. My emotions were all over the place, I was always crying, lashed out at him a few times, and he got overwhelmed and broke up with me. 
A few months later, we start talking again and end up getting back together. In the time we ere broken up, he had gotten really involved in his frat and become a bit more of a fratty dick. He broke it off AGAIN and immediately started dating one of the girls that frequents his frat house (I almost never went to the frat house, I'm pretty introverted so it's not really my scene). 
Then, again, about 6 months later, we started talking again and dated again for over a year. In this time, I graduated college and started working quite far away (about 300 miles away), but his parents live near me and he lives near my parents, so we managed to see each other at least once or twice a month. He's still very fratty and lives in a frat house, which I know is full of hotgirls, but I trusted him to be faithful.
Then, last night, out of nowhere, he breaks up with me over skype. Saying we just arent lovey anymore and I'm just not feeling it anymore. I hang up on him. I was just at his parents house last weekend! Later last night, he starts texting me saying he was lying about not loving me anymore, the reason he broke it off was because he had cheated on me and was overcome with guilt. Now he's continuing to text me about how he cares about me and wants to be at least friends if he moves to my city when he graduates (he's a year younger and will most likely get a job in the same city as me, if not in thesame company).   All I've responded is I believe you. . I don't know how to handle this. The boy has been doing this for 3 years and I've had enough. That said, I still really care about him and he's been the center of my life for almost 4 years. Any advice?

edit: I should mention I'm not one to get emotionally invested in things. He is the only person I've ever said I loved. I cried during the firs 2 breakups, but this time I was mostly emotionless. I cried later, but didn't let him see. Probably my first time crying in 2 years. (I've potentially been desensitized from almost losing a parent)

edit 2: UPDATE: he's been texting me nonstop today telling me how much he fucked up, how he just wants me to be happy, being super dramatic about the whole thing. I'm trying to stay rational, told him it's not worth being together right now while he's in the frat. Maybe a couple years down the line, if we're in the same city, we'll see what happens. I kinda regret saying that because once again, I'm giving him hope.

**tl;dr**: 3.5 years off-and-on. When on, it's great. Even when off, we still text and hang out.

22436,Breakups,2oo8f8,"So I was with this guy for 6 years. He was emotionally, mentally and financially abusive. He refused to get a job, while I worked full time and put myself through school. He cheated a lot. He tried to fuck all of my friends, and some of them obliged. He played a lot of mind games. I could write a book about all the fucked up things he did to me, but I'll spare you the wall of text. I stayed with him because I am broken. I have extremely low self-esteem, and I needed his love for validation of worth. 

I left him in April. After a year of counseling, I was finally ready. I cut off all contact with him. 

Until July, when I discovered that he had a new 18 year old girlfriend. I became outrageously jealous. I dragged him back into my life. His gf got pregnant. And then miscarried. They got kicked out of their trailer park so I let him live with me for about 6 weeks. Things were back to the way they were before I left him. My only stipulation was that he had to leave her alone. He wouldn't, so I kicked him out. He loves her. And it fucking. Kills. Me.

I am moving out of college town back to hometown in 2 weeks, and he refuses to go back to hometown. He says that's why he wouldn't leave her alone, because he knew I was leaving and don't really want to be with him anyways.

My question for you, /r/relationships, how the fuck do I move on? I know things aren't ever going to get better, and it's time to cut my losses and get over it already. But HOW?

22453,Breakups,2w8m00,"So we've been together for about 1.5 years and we haven't really had any huge fights or anything. The reason I want to break up is because she is overly attached and needy as fuck. Unfortunately, I've been capitulating and feeding into this behavior. Whoops! This is my first girlfriend and I learned a valuable lesson.

Anyways, she's a pretty nice girl overall so I want to do anything I can to not rip her heart out. As of right now she thinks everything is hunky dory. I don't want her to be shocked when I break up with her, so I'm trying to signal to her that things might be coming to a close before I actually say the words.  Anyways, it seems like this strategy is really not working. Here's what's happened:

* I told her that I needed more personal space during the weekdays, because I'm tired from work/school. She obliged initially, but recently has been finding excuses to see me.
* I am graduating and moving for work. She told me recently that she would like to go to school near where my work is located. I told her that might not be a good idea because it's a fucking expensive area (she doesn't have nearly as much money as I do and this is also a sore spot [for me] in our relationship. I'm tired of paying for everything!). She kept finding reasons that that was the area that she should be in even after I presented some evidence to the contrary.
* She responded that we could live together to save money. I told her I did not want to live with her multiple times. She kept shooting down every reason that I gave her until I just gave up. I tried to keep all the reasons non-personal and non-breakup related.
* Then, she asked if I still wanted to be with her. I mentioned that I had considered a breakup. When she asked why I offered a few reasons. I was not totally honest here which may have been a mistake. But I did start to get closer to the core issue. She had an answer or solution for every reason I gave her. Eventually, I got tired and gave up so I could sleep.

I feel like any self-respecting person should have walked out at this point. I know damn well that if someone told me what I'd told her I would have. I am so frustrated because I don't know what I have to do!

22460,Dating,2uzrtz,"Very recently I met someone through a good mutual friend who I immediately hit it off. This doesn't typically happen with me but she's funny, quirky, and somehow matches with my personality, which if you knew me, you might think impossible. While I do really enjoy my time with her, there are few things holding me back.

The biggest thing to me is her inexperience. She's a virgin (by choice) I know, not sure about the other stuff, but she's a pretty bad kisser. It got a little awkward and I felt really bad when I tried to teach her how to kiss. While I hold nothing against her for it, I've never been with a girl who wasn't as or more experienced than me and not sure what to do. It hasn't been much a problem so far but I'm afraid of sexual frustration that might come. I know it's shallow and selfish but it's how I feel nonetheless.

I'm also a second semester senior who will be moving halfway across the country after graduation, essentially ending any relationship we might have in 4 months. And because of this, I never wanted to become attached to someone but it seems these things never come at convenient times.

22461,Breakups,1mv2sa,"So after a year of what I thought was a very strong relationship, we both leave for college. We were each others first everything. After 3 weeks of keeping in touch and talking about the next time we will see each other I tell her how much I miss her. There is a long pause. She say's she doesn't miss me and hasn't felt a spark for a while (a few weeks before we move out). She puts an end to the relationship that phone call.


I want to say I didn't see this coming, but I really can't. She had been pulling away and it made me react poorly. I couldn't understand why she didn't say or do the things she did during the height of our relationship and tried very hard to please her so she would validate me with her love again.


And in retrospect, that was the root of the problem from my end. I lost who I was to the relationship and needed her love to feel happy.


That phone call has made me feel destroyed, and has taken the amazing support she was to me out of my life. Where over the course of the relationship did I go from normal me to being dependent on her for my own confidence? 


In an email (because for one year I only deserve an explanation and not a chance to be told how she felt and try to fix things) she says it wasn't my fault at all but I am thinking way to much about what I could have done differently. How does she expect me to believe the spark just went away and there were no problems?


Here is where the truly irrational thinking begins. I start thinking that I was only an experience for her that she didn't mind having because there were no other alternatives. When ever during the relationship I asked her why she liked me it was because I came back from summer break and was tall and had green eyes. I felt lucky to be with her for such a really insignificant reason because she was an amazing person with all the qualities I wanted. Now I feel like I was a boyfriend who was a safe bet to not take advantage of her and her friend had one so why not her?


I thought our relationship was strong enough to last on the weekends we would be together each month, but it only took three weeks of her new life to be done with me. That has me feeling like shit. I want to break 2 weeks of no contact because I want to ask why did it happen? Were there other guys? Will knowing why really make me feel any better? A part of me thinks if she wronged me in some way than I won't still think she is so amazing.


Finally, not blocking her on Facebook is what spurred this post. She is having an amazing time at her new college while I feel like I may have made the wrong choice of the places I was accepted to. Seeing those pictures of her being so happy while I am feeling isolated and constantly doing anything I can to not think about her hurt the most. It really makes me feel like I never deserved to be with her in the first place. I'd rather only remember the positive sides of the relationship but this has me so hurt and bitter.


I understand this is meandering, but while reading through it if you have gone through a similar experience of someone you love leaving you than i'll appreciate knowing how you got through it. I want to get imagine myself being happy without her, but its hard when I still love her and am thinking irrationally.


Ask any relevant question and i'll make sure to answer.


**TL;DR; : Girlfriend left me because the spark she had for me went out. That hurts and has me stuck thinking negative thoughts.

A little bit of TMI but he couldn't stay up and like an idiot I kind of took it personally. and was kind of cold but not mEAN. I wasn't mad but I was confused as this has never happened to me before. afterwards we ran some errands and then I told him I had to go home.

we hadn't DTR yet but we pretty much spent all our time together I doubt he is also seeing someone else. He is kind of a player and extremely attractive and outgoing. I know he has hung out with one other girl that he told me about but assured me its just her friend.

I don't know whether I should text him. we chatted a little bit over text after I went hope but then he stopped replying. I asked him 2 questions and he never replied. so I don't know if me texting him again would just be annoying or if I should just wait for him to text me.

I need this! I hugged her but still refused to kiss her. I walked inside and she was just standing at her car begging me to come back. I feel like absolute shit because this girl adored me and I broke her heart.

22476,Infidelity,1i6rv5,"I'm going to attempt to be succinct because the amount of relevant info is quite large.  Ex-Girlfriend and I in big city in TX met via online dating website in feb 2011.  she had just moved back from Hollywood (followed a guy there in 2009).  I had moved up to big city for work after finishing my masters in small city in mid-2010. 

Guy she was with before me was 2 years of grief.  Dragged her out to Cali w/ no family or friends nearby.  He didn’t encourage her to do anything with her life (she was unemployed for a year just sitting at the apartment).  He made no money, couldn’t keep a job, worked at a popular porn production company, stayed out at work until midnight (at the studio) all the time.    Wouldn’t tell her when he was coming home or answer her calls sometimes. Super hypochondriac and constantly in the hospital for nothing.   Didn’t have a car. Late rent payments all the time.  Emotionally distant and never around. And then she found out he was emailing intimate pictures to transvestites on Craigslist and planning meetings with them. This is NOT the ex that is referred to later.

So she breaks up with him, moves back to big city in TX, then we get together only a few months later.  Whirlwind romance, july 2011 I ask her to move back to small city with me.  She wasn't going anywhere and wanted to go back to school.  I'm from small city so I miss my friends and family, and the school is one of the better ones in the area and cheap.  She agrees, we move back, goes to school.  Rooms with 2 other girls and I end up staying over all the time (though I live w/ my mom I am only over there every couple weeks if that).  Roommates don't like this.  So when renewal comes up, she gets her own place.  I stay over all the time.  Basically end up living there but no agreement made to live together, just sort of happens.  fall 2012 I ask her if she wants to make it official and I sign on the lease.

At this point her parents move several states away.  She's super sad about this.

It's time for internship (fully paid) so I help her go get clothes and practice and write her resume.  She goes to (other big city) to interview.  I go out there every time and stay at hotels with her and help her dress professionally in the morning, drive her to and wait around all day and pick her up from interviews.  She lands 3 out of 4 offers.  Takes one.  I go back to small city.  She stays there for internship - with some family I have in that city, to save rent money.  Supposed to run january to may.  so 5 months of long-distance.  We agree that we can make it through this OK.

She drives back every weekend for the first 2 months.  I would drive too but she wants to be at her own place not in the city anymore.  I offer every time but she prefers to drive.  She starts growing more distant each time.  Attempt every time to talk about it but she shuts down.  Then march she has a really big health crisis (out of the blue).  I immediately leave work and drive the 3 hours to be by her side in the hospital.  I bring her food and I hang out with her and I tell her jokes and I stay by her side for over a week, missing work (no vacation days).  Her health issue results in no more birth control pills.

So it's beginning of april.  can't resume internship because of health issue so drops it.  I think she'll come home but instead flies to her parent's place.  I'm OK since I think she needs someone to have more time to attend to her and she says probably 2 weeks.  Well 2 weeks later, I ask when you coming home? She says I haven't looked at planes but I'll check tomorrow.  several days later, haven't looked at planes, I'll check tomorrow.  Several days later, I haven't looked at planes, I will check tomorrow.  I finally say well damn, just get a ticket so I know when you're getting back, it doesn't matter when it is.  I'm glad you're having a good time w/ your parents but we have a life here and I've already been waiting several months and I want to take care of you.  Big fight ensues.  Ends up staying a total of 6 weeks.

She gets back, is back for about a week.  Acting strange, won't talk to me about anything.  Asks if she can go back to her original big city to see an old (girl)friend. I say OK and assume it will be a weekend thing.  Ends up staying there Friday until Thursday.  Thursday night, gets back, I ask to see phone because I want to show her a cool feature of the S III, she says why you want to see phone and I say well for feature but now for curiosity.  Won't show phone.  Help her fix her car (we were on the way when phone thing happened).  Back to our apartment, she breaks up with me.  I leave that night for the weekend.  Come back monday and ask to see her.  She says meet at restaurant.  I say let me come see my dog (she's watching her), she says OK.  I go to the apartment to see dog and then we go to restaurant and talk about things.  Bring her flowers.  Really sweet.  I think it goes well.  Go stay at my mom's place.  

Next day, really sick at work and I ask if I can swing by apartment before I head home.  Only live a few minutes away so I'm there before she answers text.  I find her ex-boyfriend and her hustling him to his car.  Not the previous one.  The first guy she ever dated.  Her original ex.  He left her 5 years ago.  He says I came down to surprise her today but she wants me to leave.  I tell him to stay.  I talk to him and to her and I say I can't believe all this stuff is happening.  Go inside to vomit because of illness and find pregnancy test in trash can (literally nothing else in can so it's not like I rooted around in there).  Now I know it's not just him surprising her and her rebuffing him.  We haven't had sex since before health crisis since no birth control.

She fesses up finally and says that he came down Friday after I went out of town and has been there the whole weekend.  That means that Monday she agreed to meet at restaurant, she didn't invite me over because he was here.  And when I did come over, he must have just driven around the block and hid while I was there.  After several hours of talking I leave and he stays over.  The next morning he heads back to big city (he lives about 4 hours away).  She begs to go to lunch with me that morning and I agree and we talk about it and she says that she'll end it with him if I'll give her another chance.  I ask to finally see her phone and she's obviously deleted most of his texts, but there's a few about how amazing their life together is going to be, and about 15 pictures of them together.  I throw the shit out of her phone and it shatters all over the place - This is the only violence I have ever shown her during this entire ordeal and during our entire relationship.  I am very reserved in that regard.  I end up buying her a phone a couple days later since I broke hers (a better phone than she had before.)

She calls him from my phone that night and says she needs time and he needs to respect her space and she's going to try things with me.  Stays with me for a week.  Make her go get STD panel.  We have a really great time and I think maybe it's worth working through.  I can see our old relationship coming back.

I get a copy of a relationship book and tell her to read it too.  Get her a copy as well.  She had already bought tickets to go to see her parents again before all this happened so she went back there.  I told her that she needs to be here working on things with me if I am going to get past everything.  She leaves anyway.  We have 2 2-week periods where I don't talk to her so she can think about things but I think she talks to guy.  Turns out that when she was with her parents the first time, and made me feel bad about wanting her to come back, she had been talking to him for several hours a day and FaceTiming and everything.  That's why she didn't want to come back and that's why I felt weird and like she was being distant and unresponsive.

After these periods where we have time apart, I say I think we should just break up and make it official. She agrees but wants to stay friends.  We talk about everything again and I say no way, No Contact.  Three days later she emails me and I reply back raging about why she broke No Contact when I told her she could text my mom about anything she needed from me.  It wasn't for anything important.  Then she replies and says she's sobbing and she made a huge mistake and she wants me back and will do anything for me.  So I wait a day for her to settle down and talk to her and she says she still wants to talk to me and try to work through everything.  I keep talking to her for another week. 3-4 hours on phone each night.  I'm acting on assumption that she's not talking to the ex but turns out she was the whole time, for several hours a day too.

I finally say make a damn decision, she says I choose the ex.  I say goodbye.  That was a week ago and we haven't talked.  I'm still in the apartment and she's still at her parent's for another 2 weeks.  I'm moving out tomorrow and giving my mom the keys so I don't have to see her again.

I guess my main question is what's normal for my feelings at this point?  Was I stupid to believe her and to give her the chance to even try things again?  I felt SO TERRIBLE the entire time she was going back and forth with me.  It was about a month and a half where I couldn't even wake up in the morning and I started coughing up blood and getting extremely stressed and having issues at work.  But since the latest NC (it's been a week) I really don't feel that bad.  I've had time to reflect on everything and before I felt like she was perfect and I just wanted her back in my life; now I think a lot of other things about her.  I was hoping to get some outside perspective on it from people not invested in the relationship.  I have a lot of family and friends who have rallied around me to support me during this time but I want a less biased opinion if possible.

Also right before the NC, she asked if she could change her mind and still have a shot with me.  I said super unlikely but she said that she will call me in a month from the date of the NC.  She is going to spend 2 weeks w/ her parents then 2 weeks with the guy and then she wants to re-evaluate everything and make a decision then.  I say this is BS and unfair and I can't believe she asks me that.  But I kind of lose the will to say no on this one and I say I don't expect a call but I will answer if you call.

Should I answer if she calls?  My gut says HELL NO.  Me 2 weeks ago would've said HELL YES.  I'm not sure what me in 2 weeks will think.

I know they say love is unconditional and all but I think we can agree that it's usually not.  And I can't comprehend why she would leave me for this guy.

already making almost 70k a yr at 24 years old - had an offer for high 70's salaried with big bonus but rejected so she would be able to finish school (required relocation).
no debt at all.  2 paid off cars (I love cars), paid my own way through school working the whole time, took several classes above recommended workload each semester.  Finished my masters a month after I could legally drink.  Paid off all school loans myself already.  Helped her out financially with everything.
fairly fit, a bit more chubs since I met her though (she eats a lot more junk than I used to, and started me on them.)  Tall, dark and handsome (kinda).
I've got money in the bank, planning on buying a house for us so we wouldn't have to live in apartments anymore.
I'm super sweet.  I make incredibly good food AND wash the dishes (she's supposed to but doesn't).  Always make time for her.  Always help her when she needs anything.  Never unfaithful.  Never even talked to other girls - she was offended by my having female friends so I broke contact with them for her.  Thought she was incredibly sexy and always showed it. I told her how much I loved her every day. 
Drink one beer every few months with food.  No smoking, no drugs.  Super smart and into all kinds of hobbies.  Just got ham radio license.  Build my own audio equipment.  Write mobile apps and websites.  Very sociable and tons of friends (who I never got to see when I was with her because she's so introverted and jealous.)  Play Guitar and Piano proficiently.  Into mixing/mastering.  Getting pretty good at photography.

barely high school educated, works at coffee shop as barista for 6 years. used to get drunk constantly, even by himself at home. depressed. morbidly obese.  not an exaggeration either.  she said the same thing. short. unreasonably obsessed.  she found posts of his talking about her and how much he missed her before they even started talking - they broke up 5 years ago!!

got a tattoo of them when she wasn't even talking to him
no hobbies other than writing which he won't do anything with
wants to maybe someday become a bartender

She has mentioned she thinks she can get him to lose weight and start submitting his writing to places and get a better job.


I just don't see what she sees in him.  His value from an absolute standpoint seems extremely low to me.
 
Is she trying to fix the relationship because it didn't work out and she doesn't know why?  Is she afraid of how good things were going with us?  Weigh in and let me know.

Oh and this whole time we have been together, she has talked about getting a job but never has.  Her longest job was retail for 6 months and she's been unemployed most of her life.  And during our last talk she mentioned she might not be able to finish school so she may give up on that too.

Which was a huge mistake. I wasn't over her and she told me herself she still felt something for me, and I seriously don't get why she would stay with someone else if she still had feelings for me. Somebody tell me. 

In short, we spent a lot of time together post-breakup, and then it just happened. And not just once. And for justification she initiated things first each time, and I hate to be a homewrecker. I just still have these feelings for her and wish I could still be with her.

Act II: I find out that my best friend back home has been banging my ex since around Thanksgiving behind my back. They were always close friends and we all basically lived together during college. Never thought they would hook up, but my friendship with her is strong enough to get past this.



ActIII: Receive code red call from best friend. She drops 2 bombs. First, her and my ex are now exclusive. Second, she read through his email when he left it up on her computer. He has been responding to all sorts of sexual criagslist ads. One to a rather chubby girl. Several to random no-strings-attached girls. And one to a man. These conversations were extremely graphic and often mentioned exchanging pictures and meeting up in real life. He said stuff like 23 year old male, 195 pounds, with a big hard cock, loves licking pussy and butthole. Some of the comments mentioned things his ex (me) used to like that he was really good at and excited about sharing with others...The conversation from the MFM ad was the most jaw dropping. I have a friend who would be down to play with us. huge penis. 



Act IV: He defends himself to my best friend. Claims that he has never met up with anyone from craigslist in person and has only been responding to ads since April. He is a good guy and I am inclined to believe his defense.



Act V: What the f*** do we do now? I was planning to potentially see him when he comes out to my part of the country in a few weeks, but I don't think I can look at him the same way anymore. Do i still see him? Is this craigslist thing just a new way to get off? Would he ever take it further? What do I do with this very personal bit of information that I'm not supposed to know?

So. We dated for about 1.5 years.

First Break-up: I broke up with him, then we tried being cuddle buddies and he got confused, a few weeks later, we're back together. 

Second Break-up: About a month later, things felt like they were getting much better (We were fighting less, I was being more honest and upfront about what I wanted, etc.) But to him, things didn't feel the same since the first break up. So he breaks up with me, I try to maintain zero contact with him, but after about a week he calls me upset about the whole NC thing and we meet up, have a big emotional talk, and agree to be friends.

A later, we graduate and it's summer.

He's over half an hour away for most of the summer, so we mostly just text, and occasionally I'd visit the area with some friends and meet up with him.

Another month later, I fuck up.

We hook up. (We're both still virgins... is there a term for hooking up without sex?)

Then we hook up again..

.. and again.

Honestly, I was pretty happy about it, I would assume he was too. I'm not good at reading into people though. The last time we got together was about a week ago. Then things started feeling different, and all of a sudden I'm feeling the same way I used to feel when we were dating. 

Rejected, lonely, not wanted.

He's not doing anything to make me feel like this, but I'm afraid and confused. I can admit that I never stopped having feelings for him. All summer I missed him. There was a point where I thought I was over him, but I guess not.

I don't think I'll truly be over him if I continue to keep in contact with him. So tonight I texted him and told him we should stop talking to each other. Not in a rude or mean manner.

But I'm afraid he'll be sad again from feeling alone. I don't want that.

College starts next week, so I hope moving on will be easier for the both of us. 

I guess what I want to know is if what I'm doing is right. If my actions this summer was a mistake, and what the best way to move on is.

But most importantly, I just need someone to let me know that he's going to be okay, and that I'll be okay too.

My ex and I were dating for almost three years before everything happened. We were such a happy couple, and she never showed that anything was wrong until the night she broke up with me. 

She was a little quiet a couple of weeks before things happened, but I figured that it was because she was under a lot of stress from work, volunteering, and nursing clinicals. Winter this year was hard on both of us, because of school, and not having a lot of money to go out and do things together. So every Friday nights we would have date night, and watch a movie together. She seemed so happy. 

But one Friday in March she barely even laid next to me, and I asked if we were alright. She then broke down and told me she didn't feel happy anymore, and that we were done. I was shocked. I still am. I never saw it coming. 

We met one week after everything happened, because I told her that she never really told me what happened between us that night, and that I needed answers. We met, and I told her how I felt we both slacked off, that I was looking forward to spring to reignite our spark together, how I had so many plans for us, and we would be fine. 

She told me that she wasn't happy anymore, that she was bored with what we did over the winter, yet she never told me this when she first started feeling this, which according to her was back in February. But now after listening to me, she said that she was unsure about her decision, and for the next three hours, she was happy again, wanting to snuggle, and wanting to get back together. We met again later that night, and when she left, she said that she changed her mind, and that no matter what we did, she didn't feel like it would matter.


We were texting off and on for a week, until I told her that I couldn't do this anymore, since she still sounded like my girlfriend, even though she didn't want a relationship with me. Ever since then, we haven't talked. I'm at a loss for what to do. 

Should I try and text her? I'm still best friends with her cousin and brother. They hang out with me every weekend, and I will see her at her brother's graduation party. Every day she is on my mind.

Last night I [21 M] was at an engagement party which turned into a mini reunion between me and all my old hometown friends. It was our first time all being together again since high school so we were all drinking pretty heavily and having a good time, because of this we all ended up crashing at my friends house.

One of my old friends [21 F], we'll call her Gertrude, was there. She was one of my closest friends and someone I was always extremely attracted too in High School. during the day time we talked a bit but it in no way felt like we were crossing any boundaries (which I am usually extremely cautious of out of respect of my GF and not wanting to make her look bad). I did catch her looking at me a lot as the night went on and as we got increasingly drunk.

I ended up blacking out and falling asleep on the floor. The next thing I remember is her snuggled up next to me under the blankets with all the lights off and everyone asleep; and I was feeling her up while she kinda grinded up on me. I was kind of in a half asleep state and was not completely in touch with reality. I think she may have been too as after about 20 seconds or so of this she stopped and said, I_Fucked_Up123, think about what you're doing. It took me a sec but I snapped out of it and realized the gravity of the situation. I apologized and rolled over and she moved to the couch. 

I talked to Gertrude about it this morning and apologized again and she said, Apologize for what? Nothing happened. I confided in one of my good friends [21 M] as well what happened. His thoughts were that it wasn't cheating as worst stuff happens at strip clubs and my GF already told me she was ok with me going to a strip club. He also suggested not telling my GF about it.

So now I'm sitting here feeling like an ass hole, wondering or not if I should tell my GF what happened. I don't know if I'll be able to hang out with her without the guilt hanging over me. At the same time I don't want to lose that trust that I've built with her, and It wasn't really all that bad (comparable to grinding on the dance floor, which she has done with other guys in the past and actually gotten hickies from as well, but that's another story).

My girlfriend doesn't like to drink often, but her older sister was over and she drank a little bit. Later in the night we were talking and my gf's sister made a joke comment about us having a threesome.

Later or so gf and I were talking about it and I got her to unknowingly admit to me that she had a threesome with two dudes.

I didn't press her or try to scare her, but the next day I talked to her about it when she was sober. She started denying it then trickle truthing me, and well it eventually came out that she had one with two guys in college.

I wasn't so much disgusted as I was shocked. Had my girlfriend been this wild nympho for me, I would have just accepted it or if she was honest to me about her past. We have a decent sex life but overall I'd say it's pretty vanilla. And this revelation, also made me doubt a lot of what she told me about her past relationships.

I ended up breaking things off with her, primarily for her dishonesty. I do feel bad because she has been begging to talk to me. There is another odd part to our relationship, prior to meeting me she had to take sleeping medication to fall asleep, but when she is in bed with me, she can fall asleep naturally. And now she is guilting with me about this.

22522,Infidelity,29peas,"So, the short-ish version (this has been a loooooong, painful saga):

My best friend T (31f) is married to M (40m). 18 months ago, she and I went out clubbing, and T got the number of a guy that she eventually met up with and 'messed around' with. This was very surprising, since she's been with her husband M for 13 years, and never expressed dissatisfaction with their relationship. She didn't see the guy again.

6months after that, she confessed to seeing a friend of mine P(24, m) for dinner. They apparently met through my facebook. T asked if I minded, and I said no; I wasn't in charge of P, and she could make her own decisions.

T and P slept together, and T decided she couldn't face her husband;M. I said she could move into my spare room. 

She lived with me for a very hectic and stressful 6 months. She mostly stayed with P (at his parent's house), but still occasionally snuck away from P to see her husband; M. I regrettably covered for her when people would turn up / call looking for her. In hindsight, I should have been honest or completely un-involved.

T spent a lot of time crying and angsting over her feelings for P *and* M. I tried to help, but I'm a fence-sitter. I know what I would do, but I don't feel I can tell people what they should do. 

In this 6 months of T living with me, M took to calling *me* asking for advice, because he was totally in the dark. T completely ignored his calls and texts for the whole 6 months. I couldn't tell him the truth (i know, I know), but I told him she was safe, and sad, and confused (true).

T (31, wife) eventually cracked and told M (40, husband) about P (24, boyfriend). Then she moved out of my house and went somewhere to stay with P. 

Next came the barrage of abuse and spiteful, **nasty** texts and threats from T to me. Apparently she was very very mad that I had ever spoken to M (even though I gave her a free room, covered for her when she asked, told her when M and I spoke, and let her read the texts between M and I). It was also apparently my fault that this all happened because she met P through me. This was hurtful and infuriating, so I blocked her number on my phone, and her on facebook. I continued to speak to M, because he is a good guy, and very lost. I still try to be objective about all of this, despite my current opinion of T.

*Fast forward to now*: T has been full-time with P since she left my house 6 months ago, but I've just learned she has been sleeping with M on the side. He's unhappy about letting this happen, but he still loves her (although thinks he can't forgive her).

Last night, P called M. They had a 'chat', even though T tried to prevent it happening. Again, I was blamed by P for 'allowing T and P to be friends' (only including that detail to emphasize how stupid this all is).

This most recent development has derailed M's recovery from the pain, and he is leaning very heavily on me for support again. I want to be there to help, but M's feelings towards me have lately crossed the line to 'inappropriate', and I certainly don't want that to be happening.


If you got this far in the story; you're a trooper.


My question is; how can I be the best support to M, whilst still maintaining some distance? I don't believe in trash talking T or P, because I honestly believe they are just really stupid people. I don't want to tell M what to do, because he has so much faith in my own personal opinion, but it's only MY opinion. It's not necessarily going to be the right thing for him, and i don't want to influence his actions.

At the same time, he is desperate for direction, because he is quite honestly, a broken man. He does not deserve this, but I don't know what more I can do.

I am a female and a close girlfriend of mine, let's call her Q has opened me up to the world of non-monogamous relationships. She gave me a few books when I expressed interest and has herself been trying to find her a comfortable place and style within non-monogamy. I myself have never practiced a true poly or non-monogamous relationship, but I would like to if circumstances allow for it.

Today I began messaging a man I know Q has slept with previously. They aren't very close anymore and after he viewed my profile I reached out and mentioned we had a mutual friend. Phone numbers were exchanged and vague hints at meeting up were dropped but we've been talking for less than a day... so, nothing has happened. 



I expressed this all to my friend Q and she reacted in an unexpected way. She says she is overwhelmed and needs to process her emotions and she will get back to me.

If nothing happens all of her anxiety will have been for nothing. I also worry that she'll feel like I betrayed her by simply reaching out, a sentiment that would be offensive, slightly.

22534,Breakups,2doy10,"Hello.

Just a little background to the story:

I used to date a girl for three years, we broke up last february (if interested on details on this, ask in comments, but i feel is not relevant). 

We kept as friends with benefits, but I just couldn't take it anymore. She was also seeing/going out with other guys, and I felt awful. I still felt she belonged to me, even though she didn't. This relation was starting to get really toxic, because I was angry at her / about her almost all the time. I just felt good when I was with her, but messaging always gave me problems, because she wouldn't answer so much. 

Besides, lately I started to feel she didn't really care about me as much as she did. Like if she found someone else, but she just didn't wanted to tell me. Last time I saw her was last wednesday and it was awesome. Yesterday she got out with friends, and wouldn't pay attention to my messages. I asked her to send me one after she got home and then I fell asleep. I woke up and no message. That was the last straw (she does this often, even though I ask the favor to just let me know when she's home). I might be over reacting, because we are no longer attached to each other, but that's exactly why I made the decision to stop contact with her. I was having way more bad times than good times.

Right now I'm feeling depressed, and guilty. I feel like I made a mistake, I just love her so much, I'm not the kind of person who can stop contact with someone just from one day to another, and much more less if I'm in love with that someone. I just need some advice, to keep going. I don't know if I'm making the right choice.

22547,Breakups,1jpdnj,"So... backstory. I met this guy in March-ish at church, I thought he was a good guy and wanted something, he just wanted to be friends, I developed feelings for him, he ended up developing feelings for me, and then things got messy.

Since he's 19 and his family is really against dating anyone underage, he was really apprehensive about starting things with me, but all resistance essentially turned to crap after a while. We decided we were going to try to wait until I turned 18 (a year and a half from now) and just stay friends for now, which meant being friends but he essentially ended up being my boyfriend without the physical stuff or a real date.  At most there were bear-hugs and cuddling and some intense eye-contact. 

He broke things off about three days ago... The reasoning all essentially came down to **bad timing**-- he was afraid that if we're waiting we might be missing out on opportunities with people who we could be better with (we're kinda opposites and I'm not exactly his type, but I feel like we could have still been best friends had we not developed feelings), he wouldn't be able to resist getting physically involved because of how emotionally invested we were, and his family just isn't really supporting of the relationship itself (they really like me, just not the fact that I’m under 18).


He still wants to be friends because he still cares about me and wants to make sure I’m okay. We also really enjoyed our friendship-- even without the extra affectionate stuff-- and there’s still a chance we could end up together if we stay friends… 

But I really don’t know if I can just be friends with him, or if it’s realistic, or how long it’s gonna take for me to be ready for something like that. Right now I still only want to end up with him. Even though he might think there are better “options,” I’m having a hard time seeing that (which is probably break up goggles). 

He’s most likely leaving for another University next year (he’s going to Community College right now) and I’m just really afraid that by the time I turn 18 it’s gonna be too late, or if we are friends that the feelings will just be gone.

I don’t want to lose feelings for him because I’m afraid that it’ll ruin my chances of anything starting again in the future, but I also don’t want to hold on to feelings for him while we’re friends and end up all Taylor-Swift-You-Belong-With-Me if he finds someone else. 

Plus he's treated me better than any other guy ever has, and I don't know if maybe it's still the breakup goggles but whatever. Still, even without that, I know he was just a really ***really*** good guy, and I don't want to lose that. I'm having a really hard time letting go because I know he still cares about me, and still wants to be with me… but he just can't.

After work, a friend of mine called late in the evening, jokingly saying that an angel dropped out of heaven just like I wanted, and wanted to to meet her. My mate was out with his girlfriend and his gf had brought a friend. I agreed, and we all met at her house, a place she's renting. Cute action by my friend, I seriously owe a lot to him, they leave me and her later and we talk and chit chat till daylight pops up again, and I leave with a hug. I get the sense she has a lot of life experience, more mature than most, I really enjoy being with her, I don't need to tell more than that I want to try this out, for sure. After this meeting, I met her another evening, decided we wouldn't stay awake for too long, brought some alcohol as well, though nothing sexual happened. I do get the thought of kissing her while leaving in a split second, but decide not to, but she definitely noticed. 

Nevertheless, getting to the point, she called me a wonderful person and wanted to know my first impressions of her. I'm not too good at this, though I said it definitely wasn't bad (she thought it was? she's had some past trouble, lived without her parents since 15 etc., but amazingly mature and knows way more than me at these things). I get to hear after this, by my friends girlfriend that she thinks that we might really fit together, but she thinks she wants to do it slowly. She said herself to me that she wonders if she can feel for anyone again, as she has been abused, beaten etc. (she showed me the text message of how her ex apologized, saying that he'd throw her around, beat her etc.), that he started out nice, and turned into an asshole, so she dated one guy, who turned into an asshole as well. She hasn't told me the deal about taking it slowly, but I sense we've just gotten started, as we don't regularely talk etc. outside meeting each other, and as the last things my friends gf said to me, she definitely wants to meet again, it's just that I'm the one who's taking initiative, like normally, I guess.

   I broke up with her then because I wasn't making her happy. I tried my best to look after her, we had a ton of fun together, and I was her rock. My insecurities made me want to break up with her because that semester I was fucking up and being a moron.

Two semesters before that I broke up with her because I felt like she deserved a better man. I cried for nights knowing I have to break up with her because I wasn't making her happy even though every day I was spending my nights with her, treating her out to places, and seeing her smile. My brain still thought she hated me for some reason and would leave me for another man.

Fast forward to Jan 2015, we decide to give it another shot. We have the most amazing semester together with little fighting, I enjoy seeing her every day, I enjoy doing everything together. 

I start having dreams the entire semester of her cheating on me or leaving me for another man while doing long distance. I hold onto her tight every night hoping she never leaves me because of this diamond that I can call mine.

Summer break comes. Girls start flirting with me, I am getting attention from girls everywhere I go. I start to wonder why my girlfriend rarely flirted with me or was sexual that entire semester. I get greedy and flirt with 3-4 girls through text. I feel dirty about it. I meet with one of them but it's just weird to me. She tries to feel me up and try to kiss me but I tell her I'm uncomfortable.

I go home.

I go home and stop talking to her. I stop initiating conversations with any girls but I'm still getting texts from other girls. I reply back but I'm still cold and it's just one word replies.

My girlfriend calls me randomly the same day I'm feeling this way. She asks me if I'm cheating and I lie to her stating that I've done alllll this stuff with women, because I knew if she knew that she would never take me back. I was feeling so insecure that she didn't view me the same way as our relationship before, and I wanted her to find a better man to make her happy.

Phone call hangs up. I spend the next few days in my room crying my eyes out saying not again, not again, why did I say that? I'm so stupid, why did I just ruin everything when I promised myself the last breakup that I wanted to marry this woman.

I realize it's over. Go on stupid date that day she called me. New girl is cool and we have a lot in common but she is super needy and affectionate and it feels weird that it's not my girlfriend. I cut contact with her but she won't leave me alone. I tell her it needs to stop and block her number.

Since that phone call I've been sulking in my room thinking what an idiot I am and that my insecurities just drove away a woman I wanted to propose to next year. I threw my life away, I threw away everything I worked towards. Most importantly and the only thing that still makes me cry every few hours is imaging her face and her crying falsely thinking that I've cheated on her. I constantly see images of her crying in my arms, or me holding her in bed as she cried to me or her calling me to hug her and hold her because of problems in her life.

I understand I fucked up and there's no way she will come back to me. I just want her to be happy in the future and I would give my life if I knew she would stop being sad all the time. She has depression and anxiety and she doesn't deserve anything.

What advice can you give me? What can I do to make it better for myself, and ultiamtely for her? It's understood that she doesn't want to see me or speak to me, so I'm going to go no contact until she feels ready to have a brief chat if she ever does. Is this the best decision? Thank you.

22571,Breakups,2cp7k3,"I've been dating with my girlfriend for approx 5 years now. I'm 23, she is 20. We started to date when I was 18 and she was 15! We have had some on/off periods, lately. Mostly becuase she cheated on me few years ago and I went extremely needy/insecure about her. She has always came back to me, no matter what I do. 

Lately, she has been hiding her phone from me and it has been made me even more insecure about it. She wants to get married with me, but at the same time acts very immature. I snooped on her and found out that she has been flirting with another guy for a while.

Few weeks ago she told me that she wants some space and she isn't sure about me.

She accused me of being too insecure and nervous all the time. I accused her for not putting enough effort in this relationship. Trust is VERY important factor for me, but it seems like she is a bit slutty and likes to flirt a lot. I guess she found a rebound, I quickly agreed that this relationship isn't THAT good and we really need that break. Then I went NC for 10 days and during that time she got her stuff from the apartment. She has been sending me some I miss you, we should get back together text messages, but I have been numb. I told her that this is an ongoing issue and we really need to fix eachother before we dive into relationship again. 

She left some of her stuff in my apartment and we agreed on a meetup tomorrow. I'm going to give her stuff and she is going to hand me the apartment key.

Now, I know she will start talking about us and the relationship and I'M NOT SURE HOW TO ACT....

I really want to keep NC for a while, at least 21 days, preferably more because I'm pretty unhappy in this relationship and I think that I'm the only one who is really trying to get this to another level (marriage, kids) although she wants to engage.

***TL;DR***

Dated gf 5 years. Had some on/off periods. I went insecure, she started to flirt with another guys and is hiding her phone. She told me she wants a break. 10 days NC = she wants to talk about us and fix our relationship. I have a feeling that she is not ready for that and still needs some time to be without me. We are going to meet tomorrow for the (last?) time. What should I do, how should I act?

I really love that girl, but I don't want to get into toxic relationship.

22572,Dating,2hjuwz,"I had been dating this girl for several months.  We got along extremely well, she made every attempt to hang out and spend time together.  We went out to dinner, took a few weekend trips, etc.  Interests were similar, personalities were, everything seemed to be going well.  We never slept together, but she did stay the night a couple of times. She always said how amazing i was, that we should hang out more, and that the time we spent together was incredible.


One night at dinner, however, i asked her how she felt about things and what she thought of being in a relationship.  She said that she wanted to take things slow but also that she wouldn't be seeing anyone else.  From there it was pretty much all downhill.  I have been breaking my back trying and get her to hang out with me, she won't text me back most of the time, she blocked me on Snapchat (which i hadn't used to contact her in months), and overall just a ton of distance has been created.  She's lied numerous times in order to avoid spending time with me (fishing, hiking with the dog, a trip to the hot springs, low-commitment things). 


After about 5 years of not being in a relationship, i really fell for this girl.  When things went south, it hurt like hell and it's not something id like to go through again with her.  She hasn't treated me well, been honest, or even acted like a continuing friendship is something she's interested in.  With that said, i am still captivated by her and my personality isn't one to let things die like this.  If i see the opportunity to get something i want, i will work hard and strive to get it. 


I had asked her what was going on, and why things went so wrong.  She said that she wasn't ready to be in a relationship at the moment due to an extremely bad past experience.  I have no idea if this is a cop-out or not, thoughts?  Everything she says to me is encouraging and makes me think theres a chance, but her actions say the exact opposite.  I have also never pushed her at all to go out of her comfort zone.


So it had been about 2 weeks of no contact whatsoever, then out of no where i get a text from her suggesting some new music that i might like.  Should i even respond to her (a decency she didn't offer me for the past few weeks).  2 wrongs do not make a right and all i can control are my choices.  I don't like not responding out of a sense of decency, but i also don't want to get hurt again.  Further, i want her to know that i'm upset with her.  I just don't like playing those type of 'games', but speaking with her face to face (which i would prefer) doesn't seem to be a possibility right now.


A little background on me:  I graduated from college (which i worked through, so i didn't have any student loan debt), currently have a steady and prosperous job, just bought my first house, and own a well behaved dog.  I'm fit (backpacking, mountain biking, climbing, etc. will do that to ya), and for the most part a decent looking guy.  I treated this girl (and all others) with absolute respect.  I've talked with some close mutual friends and we all agree that I couldn't have been more of a gentleman to her. I'd say my largest flaw is how awkward i am; really, it can be bad.  Dancing and singing are so far out of my comfort zone its ridiculous, but i will do them for/with the right girl.  Overall, i think i have a lot to offer and did everything 'by the books'.  I'm confident that i treated this girl as well as could be expected, and am just confused on how to proceed and what caused the whole situation in the first place.


What the fuck is going on?  Should i just mark this up to a loss and move on with my life?  Should i keep trying to be her friend?  Should I continue to pursue this girl? Obviously its almost impossible for you to judge this accurately not knowing more about me, her, and what's happened between us, but if you have any questions, just ask.  Thanks for any suggestions or advice, it's much appreciated!

Upon leaving for school, the friend told my girl to keep an eye on her boyfriend while she is away as she won't be back until after the school year is over. Unfortunately, the boyfriend is fooling around with another girl. My girl gave the guy an ultimatum (last week?) saying she would tell her friend if he didn't stop seeing this girl (nothing sexual had happened to that point, so no harm no foul). He said OK. Then last night she saw the girl had slept over (i.e. sexual boundary has probably been crossed).

My girl is in a pickle. She obviously has an obligation to her friend to tell her about her boyfriend's infidelity, but at the same time, this guy is her roommate and if the friend found out he would obviously know who told her. I asked my girl if she is on the lease and she said yes (in other words, it is not like the roommate is the sole leaser and can kick her out if shit hit the fan).

22578,Infidelity,21rpo2,"So (M27) I've been with this new girl (26F) for four months now and things are getting serious. Though a year ago I went through a rough divorce after finding out my wife was having an affair, so I've been trying to take things slowly. Anyways, we had discussed threesomes and bringing in other partners into our relationship and were both for it. I went out of town for her birthday party, and while I was gone she had a threesome with our roommates. No penetration. She said she did stuff with the girl, which I'm okay with, but also that she went down on the guy for a minute and sat on his face while he fucked his girlfriend. She initially told me nothing happened, but then a few hours later told me the truth. She said at the time she was blackout drunk, and she didn't think I'd be upset because we had discussed it before, but she said looking at it now she realizes she cheated on me. She spent days sobbing and begging me to forgive her and give her another chance, and I've decided to because I do care a lot about her. I'm torn though. I have two problems. the first is she lied to me initially about it, which infuriates me. The second is that these were experiences we agreed to have together, and she had it without me, while I was 6000 miles away. I understand how in her drunken state it didn't seem like cheating, and if I were there then it definitely wouldn't have been cheating (I've expressed to her before that the thought of her going down on another guy is a turn on for me), but I thought we had agreed to do these things together. On the one hand I really care about her and I think this  is a gray area of cheating, on the other hand I don't know if the struggle to forgive her is worth it considering we've only been together for four months or so. I'm having problems moving on and not picking at this scab by thinking about the details of what went down. How can I forgive her? Should I? Is what she did cheating? I mean, we hadn't formalized rules, but I felt that considering that I was absent that it would go without saying that doing stuff with other people while I'm not there is not acceptable. I don't want to tell my friends or family, because after what they saw me go through when finding out my ex wife was cheating, I know they'll have no tolerance and instantly hate this girl. So any outside opinions are greatly appreciated.

---   TLDR: Not sure if what she did counts as cheating, though she did lie to me and now I'm not sure if putting in the effort to forgive her is the right decision.

22582,Breakups,1rlqoq,"I(24M) have been together with my SO(22F) for 5 years now. The first 2 years we were together, everything was great and while we had our arguments, it was typical couple things. We were in a long distance relationship (An hour apart) the first 2 years, but we spent several days at each others places to sort of make-up for that and because it was only an hour apart, our parents were kind enough to save us money on trains and drive us back and forth.

She then went off to college when she was 19, and I followed a year later. She stayed in residence her first year and we had spoken about moving in together since I'd be coming up to school the following year. I figured with the cost of residence and the very low privacy, paying $200 extra a month for my own apartment wasn't bad, and I am doing it with the girl I love, awesome I thought. 

The first few weeks was pretty good; we were happy, we were having fun and just having each others company constantly was great. Then as time went on, it seemed that she got more controlling, our arguments had gotten so much more heated, she didn't take my suggestions to heart and sometimes she'd suggest what I did, like when I did it, it didn't matter but since she did it now, we could do it. Basically, she was really selfish. I talked to her about it several times and she brought up several things about me she found annoying, which was fine, we were communicating and I loved that. I started working on how I could change my flaws and make things better, without changing my personality.

As time went on, the issues however got worse. She remained the same but to be fair, she did have instances when I thought Wow, she is trying to make this work but they weren't as often as the selfishness. I then started chalking this up to her mother and sister; literally horrible people. They'd belittle her and basically treat her like shit. I started to figure that perhaps she was getting stressed from them when she'd visit, and bring it home to me?

She had intimacy problems throughout the whole relationship, but that's because she was raped. I was understanding but after about 3.5 years, she'd continue turning away from me if I tried kissing her during sex, as well other times. Sex had basically become scripted in the sense that, she had to be laying in bed naked for anything to happen most of the times. To be fair though, she'd also send me erotic pictures sometimes, telling me to come upstairs, which I loved but didn't happen much. I couldn't do it any more, and so I brought it up but she'd say it was the memory of the rape so I immediately dropped it, albeit reluctantly; I felt like an ass-hole for holding that over her like it was her fault, yet it hurt whenever she'd turn away like that.

I am a writer, and I want to have my books published. I asked her to read my books and tell me what she thought, which she agreed. Although, time would go by and she'd do nothing. When I asked her she said it was school getting busy, I get that. But then she would do other things, like read her books (store bought) or go on facebook. She'd even do this when we were trying to watch shows together (We love Supernatural and such)

We moved out of our apartment in June of this year; I came to live with my parents and she went to her parents, who had moved and now lived 2 hours away. We had money issues so we had no choice sadly. 

Now, it feels like living together was the biggest mistake we made. We saw each other for who we truly were since before we could dress up our personalities. I do love her, and I couldn't see myself with another girl but I'm literally torn up that she doesn't support me, is selfish and seems very distant. I don't know what to do, and I'm honestly confused! I love this girl more then anything, I lost my virginity to this girl and she accepts me for my childish, nerdy self; something people say they hate about me because I don't grow up 

I'm so confused and conflicted; I want it to work but I feel unhappy and just; my heart is saying I love her and my brain is telling me to pull up my big boy pants and go be happy.

I'll try to make this short. I've been dating my boyfriend, James, for just over a year. This is my first longterm relationship and I'm absolutely, head over heels in love with him. We've never had any real issues and we hardly fight (mostly small disagreements). He's always seemed deeply in love with me - always complimenting me, telling me how he wants to spend the rest of his life with me, etc. He was cheated on in one of his past relationships so obviously, combined with how he treats me, I never suspected he would do this.

Our relationship became long distance this past summer when I went home from university for a few months. We promised to visit each other and Skype as much as we could (home for me is 12 hours away). During this time, he was very loving and we really missed each other. At some point during the summer (June, I believe) he ended up hanging out with one of his female friends from high school and apparently they madeout and touched each other above their clothes but after feeling incredibly guilty, he decided to stop and leave. 

He didn't tell me about any of this until last night when he was over at my house. After I had a good ugly cry (and several how could you do this to mes), he asked if I wanted more details. I asked him why he did it and he told me that he had been really missing me and he thought that maybe hooking up with that girl would fill the hole inside him. He said that it had haunted him for weeks and that he had blocked it out of his mind, intending to tell me over winter break because of how I've been feeling recently (been severely depressed, feeling worthless - he's been very supportive). 

He ended up staying over but respected that I didn't want to be kissed, cuddled, etc. I woke up this morning feeling deeply sad. I can't understand his reasoning, I don't understand how cheating on someone would make you miss them less. He seems to really be sorry but I don't know whether to trust him or not (I've read a lot of posts about people cheating on this sub). I don't know what to do, I've been crying all day.

I don't really have many friends at school anymore so this is my last resort. I feel so alone. 

EDIT: Thank you so much to everyone who commented, you all gave me a lot of perspective. Last night, he came over and there was a lot of crying and hugging. He said that waiting so long was really dumb of him and he only did it because he was so scared of telling me. He told me that he cheated because he missed me physically, I told him that that was incredibly stupid and not the way to express those feelings - that I missed him physically too but I didn't fuck anyone in my hometown. He agreed and said that maybe I should just break up with him because he really hurt me. He said that he loves me with all his heart and I don't have to deal with this. After hearing more from his side and seeing that he's truly angry with himself, I've decided not to break up with him - for now. If I just can't do this and I constantly feel shitty / can't trust him, then I'll end it later on. For now, he's in the doghouse.

22590,Infidelity,2j6ppf,"I'd like to keep this brief and vague as people we know are on Reddit. I'm tired of all the attention we've gotten IRL so I'd like to avoid creating more drama.

My partner (let's call him Dan) of over a decade cheated. He slept with someone else whilst away on business and confessed as soon as we returned home from the airport. He seemed genuinely remorseful and apologised over and over. His explanations (idk they sounded like excuses to me but he insisted they were 'explanations' not excuses) were bullshit and hurt me almost as much as the cheating did. But I don't want to go too much into it.

I broke up with him. I had to do it. He has always known that cheating is an absolute no-go for me. My parents went through an incredibly nasty split after one cheated on the other. This was when I was very young. I swear like 99% of my childhood was watching them fight, or listening to them crying. Really rough stuff. It fucking sucked. Since then I just have no tolerance for infidelity. Dan was very well aware of this. VERY well aware. He was there for me through a lot of it (their fighting continued through my teen years ugh) and knows what it did to both them and myself.

Dan has tried to make amends. It's been a while since all this went down and he has committed himself to making it up to me. Letters, presents, flowers, etc. I can see he regrets what he did. In a way, I appreciate the efforts, but we are over from my POV. I've tried thinking of being with him but it makes me feel ill. The attraction is gone, the love is fading fast. So if you ask me, that's that. 

The only thing is that Dan is a huge part of my life. He works very closely &amp; successfully with a family member. We share friends. He shares hobbies/paid memberships to stuff with my mum and sis. I've gotten really close with one of his family members who still wants me around. Basically, we're fused together and I think it's going to be that way for life. Nobody is keen to get rid of him - after confessing to me, he asked if he could confess to everyone else. With my permission, he did. He's been trying to make it up to them to and it's working. They've forgiven him. Don't get me started on how they're pressuring me to do the same... it's pretty fucked up if you ask me. Basically I need more time. I have told him very clearly that we are over and I can't accept his actions or his excuses/explanations.

Sorry if this is a bit jumbled. I guess to sum it up here itis:

* Dan cheated and confessed immediately. I ended the relationship as infidelity is unacceptable to me.
* Dan has been nothing but honest and apologetic ever since. Others (friends, family, etc) have forgiven him. I need more time. *[edited to add: they have also been supportive of me and have offered a lot of comfort and care, it's just that they love him too]*
* Dan will remain a part of my life for some time. I can accept that. I just need to know how to cope with it... any coping strategies would do. I think we're going to have to end up being friendly at the very least or maybe with time we could even just be friends. Is that possible? Doable? Healthy?

Also a lot of friends are telling me I'm crazy and insensitive not to forgive him. Someone told me I need therapy. Believe me, I'm considering it. This has brought up a lot of painful memories for me and it's become clear I'm not as healthy or as together as I would like to be @ 32yoa.

22591,Breakups,2t75d9,"I started seeing my very first GF back in 2012. We met on Okcupid and before that I had basically zero experience with women. She had just gotten out of a 4 year relationship 2 months prior and moved to my town for college. We had rocky patches but I didn't know how to be a good boyfriend or discuss issues or deal with my feelings. I ran away from my issues and ended things 5 times during the relationship which only lasted about a day till we talked things over. 


Throughout the whole relationship, she had depression, I didn't realize it it till after the fact but I had been really depressed too. She loved me so much and would go out of her way to make me happy. We had plenty of great moments and we had plenty of not so great moments. I ended up starting to see a therapist in July of last year and got into meditation. This was very confusing for me and I ended up using meditation as a shield and distanced myself from her when I had issues to think about.


We had a fight one night at the end of October, went to bed angry, and I woke up the next morning and did just that, meditated and distanced myself. We ended up having a fight shortly after and I broke things off. We decided to stay friends and I did so much soul searching and learned so much about the relationship, myself, and got a lot of personal growth out of it. This made me realize I loved her and I wanted to be with her and there were so many things I hadn't thought about before. I was going to tell her how I was feeling but.....


We hung out one night, found out the next morning she had a new boyfriend. I had no knowledge of this and had asked her a week or two before if she felt anything for anyone and she said no. I was devastated. I ended up talking to her about it, asked if I could change her mind, ended up writing her a handwritten love letter and poured my entire heart to her(which as a first really because I had always had issues with my feelings out of confusion).


In the letter I told her I didn't think we could be friends because I cared for her too much. A week later she told me she read the letter, felt sorry but looked inside herself and didn't feel it anymore. I don't believe this at all because she told me I put her in a horrible position because she wants to be friends(aka she wants me in her life and doesn't want to let me go). I feel she's kind of moving fast with this guy and already took her new BF on her 1 week vacation to visit her family that she does once a year. 


After not hearing from her for 3 weeks(since we last talked in person, and minus a small happy new years text), she texts me when she returns from vacation and asks me how my new year is going and how my new(and first) apartment is going? I didn't know what to say so I waited till the next day and kept it short and wrote Things are going great, thanks for asking.


I guess i'm just really confused. She said she doesn't have feelings for me but she rushed into this other relationship(which clearly was to fill the void from me because she reallllllllllly cared for me a ton) and I said I didn't know if we could be friends and that she made up her mind and I should move on but now she texted me? 

I haven't heard back from her since I sent that on Monday but I really kind of want to ask her Why did I put you in such a horrible position? You have a new BF right? You told me you don't have feelings for me right? I said I don't think I can be friends with you right? So what exactly is going on here, do you actually care for me and won't admit it, do you really still have feelings for me? 


What exactly do I do here? I don't want to respond back again but I feel like there is a glimmer of spark left deep in the darkness. I don't even want either of us to take each other back. The old relationship is dead, I want to start a new one with a fresh slate and reference the past. I want us to take all of our personal growth since(because i'll tell you, I have a TON of this), and let something flourish.

We have been fighting. There was a long summer break in between, where I was emotionally hurt he wasn't there (which was, in part, irrational since his parents said he couldn't stay for free at the school. So I have been a little testier than usual with him. What happened is- he was going again, out with friends to the bars. This week is weird. It's the start of the semester


I was upset the first night we got drunk- I felt like with all of his new friends back, I was being neglected, and I was the one that texted him, skyped him all summer, suffered and cried my eyes out because I missed him so much. I just wanted to be met with the same excitement, I guess. I don't know. I told him that night I wanted something to change but then we left it at that. We kind of ignored it.


Fast forward 2 nights. His one roommate just came back, and they have to go to the 21 only bars, because they're all 21 now. Ok. I went to party with my friends- strike one against my emotional state, I should have just pregamed with them and then went to bed. I wouldn't be broken up now. So I pregame with my friends, and it's fun, but I miss the hell out of my boyfriend even having fun. 


And then they convince me to go to the bars. I go with everyone, but not my core friends- ones I only just met. At the bars I'm afraid. I'm lonely. I feel nervous. This one guy latches on to me. Says he has a girlfriend. Do you have a boyfriend? Yes-- Oh, they cancel out then. The guy is leaning heavily into me and I'm trying to be nice but in a strictly platonic way. He leans in and kisses me on the cheek. I panic and tell him I have a friend calling and leave to find some of the girls that came with the group to save me, but not before the guy grabs for my ass. I find them though. THe one girl I'm connecting with, her boyfriend is with here- so now I'm upset, I'm lonlier, and feeling vandalized.


I sent an angry drunk message to my boyfriend. That he goes out to the bars and must be ok with guys trying to flirt with me, then, and grabbing at me, and that we should just be friends with benefits. I said a lot of things I didn't mean at all, just because I was shaken and upset, which he didn't deserve.


I don't want to break up with him. That angry text- I've told him, I was overly drunk, and that's why it came up. And then he goes on to say that, I'm a wonderful girl, but he can't give me what I deserve, doesn't have the time.. I don't know why it's suddenly changed with his senior year. A part of me really thinks he is doing this because he wants a super fun senior year where he can fuck a lot of girls and go out all of the time and not feel guilty that he's leaving me at home. But that's.. not his personality. The fucking, I guess. He told me a lot though that he didn't want to do this to me and he felt guilty. 


I just want things back to how they are. I offered to work on myself, and how I get lonely without him when drinking. I want to go to counseling with him- we have a counseling center at school. At the least, work it out amongst ourselves but just suddenly.. I don't know. Maybe it was the text. We were cuddling together and now it's just gone. It's just gone. I sent him a few texts- I know, I know- and he only replied to one, where I even offered an open relationship and all he said back is that he wouldn't do that to me.

I've seen a few of these before, but I wanted to give my take on the light at the end of the tunnel.  We as humans seem to be enraptured in the idea of having someone validate our very existence.  This fact rears its ugly head quite often after a break up.  We can't go on, we can't even think of breathing without this other person around.  The line I have muttered to myself over and over again is simple, There was a time before he/she and there will be a time after he/she.

It's simple, but true.  If you were shaping your entire life and daily happiness around another person then you are lucky that you got out of it.  It's no way to live.  A happy relationship should be supportive, communicative, fun, warm, and an amplification for all of your favorite qualities about yourself. 

So to anyone who is hung up on their recent ex, just know that they don't shape your life.  They came and went as most of this life tends to do.  You probably had some great times and were offered a chance to grow and persevere through an awful time. 

Find solace in your strength and know that one person can't make you happy.  When you're ready for that, it will happen.  That much I am sure of.

22605,Breakups,2vmuwc,"This is my first post here on reddit so I'm sorry if the background information for this is too long - there is a fair bit to it.


So we had a relationship with ups and downs, mainly due to my personal mental issues (depression, anxiety, insecurity, everything else that can be detrimental to a relationship). But despite these issues, we loved each other a lot. We moved quickly, I opened up to her very easily, as she did to me. I never lied to her and I never kept anything from her, I shared all my insecurities and doubts about the relationship with her.


A week or two after our anniversary, my depression started getting worse, I started getting indifferent about everything in my life, including my relationship, and I was treating her quite unfairly. However I did start getting professional help. The day after my first psychologist appointment, she broke up with me because it was really hard for her seeing me like that and it was putting a lot of pressure on the relationship. I agreed that this was probably for the best, but I was really cut up about it. We also both agreed that we didn't want to lose each other's friendships, because we were quite good friends before the relationship.


After seeing my psychologist a couple of times, I started to get a lot better, and I approached my ex on Facebook, and apologised for all the hurt I caused her and asked her about the possibility of getting back together when we were both in a better state emotionally. She said she couldn't answer me at that time and told me she thought I needed to focus on myself.


I continued to work on myself, but I also convinced myself that we would end up getting back together. A week later I approached her again. She told me that she wanted to let the relationship go and move on as her own person because she didn't want to continue something that was causing both of us so much hurt. Naturally, I told her how I felt about the situation. I told her that I wanted to get back together when we were both in a better emotional state. She accused me of being selfish for wanting to get back together without any regard for her feelings. I asked her if she still loved me and she told me that she didn't anymore.


I was even more cut up about this, I cried a bit and got it out of my system, but then eventually convinced myself that I'd get her back. I got sucked into all those online Get your Ex Back scams. Although I didn't buy any of them, I did manage to find someone online for free and I read through them and convinced myself we'd end up getting back together.


About 2 weeks after she told me she didn't love me anymore, I saw her perform at a concert - she's a singer (that's how we met, I was a horn player in the same band that she fronted). I used this as an opportunity to talk to her, and that night I told her that she sang really well and I asked how she was. She replied but she was very closed off and cold. I could tell that this conversation was going to end the same way some others had - she was going to stop talking, I was going to wait for her to say something for ages and then we'd both just leave. So I confronted her about it. I said that if we were going to be friends, I'd appreciate it if she was a bit more open with me, and actually tell me that she didn't want to talk to me. Half an hour later I got a message back from her saying that she couldn't do friends at the moment because she was still hurting and that me talking to her was only making her uncomfortable. 


I thought it was odd that she took half an hour to say this and thought she might have been talking to her best friend about it. So I signed into her Facebook account. I'm not proud of invading her privacy like that, but my suspicion was right. She had been talking to her best friend about it. She had screenshotted the conversation with me and sent it to her friend and said things like He wants to be friends. Well ideally he wants to get back together when HE'S READY even though I've already told him I don't want to. Her friend said Friends? noooo that's gay. She said I want to tell him that I don't want to be 'friends' because it makes me uncomfortable but he's so fricking sensitive. I'm sick of his existence tbh Apparently I don't get that the relationship is over. I do now. Reading what they'd said hurt me so much that I can say that I'm not in love with her now either.


I want to confront her about this and tell her that I'm not stupid enough to think that getting back together would be my call, that I was just trying to be friendly and that I do get it. I'm hurt that she told me she wanted to be friends but now clearly doesn't want to. But I know if I confess to signing into her account she'll be all invasion of privacy and shit. I hate people having the wrong impression of me.

I found out the other day after having a look through my boyfriends phone (and yes I acknowledge this is not the right path to take), that he has been messaging other men on a Bisexual dating website. He has been exchanging photos and trying to organise meetups for Oral sex in public places (Fitting rooms, public toilets etc). Every time he tried to organise a meetup the other person cancelled at the last minute. This happened as recently as 4 days ago. He had tried to arrange a meetup in a fitting room for oral sex an hour before he was supposed to pick me up from college. The other man cancelled though and so it didnt happen.
 
He has also been using a fake profile (using photos and information of a good friend of ours) on a dating site to talk to women. He didnt exchange photos or meetup with any of these women.

I spoke to him about it straight away and told him I had looked through his phone. He said he was sorry and didnt know why he had been doing these things. He said he thinks it may be some sort of addiction as this has been going on for about 3 years, and it didnt stop throughout any of the relationships he had in that period. He said he wants to stop but cant guarantee that he wont be able to resist temptation when the time comes. 

I so badly want to work through this with him and rebuild our relationship. We may have only been together for 6 months however we already have made plans for the future and I truely believe this could be the man I spend the rest of my life with. 

We have both gone and had STD checks and are awaiting results, and he has made an appointment with a psychologist for tomorrow to figure out how to control his temptations

My issue is trying to trust him again. Every single one of my past relationships I have been cheated on and he knew this from the beginning. His infidelity had been going on since day 1 of our relationship, and I now find myself questioning every little thing has said or done throughout the past 6 months, as well as everything he says now.

Hers was about as bad as a relationship could end, he cheated on her with many, many women, in their bed. Many of these were her friends, and colleagues. She loved him a lot and he pretty much destroyed her.

We are introduced by a mutual friend and meet for a drink. The moment I saw her I knew that she was the one for me, she is everything I've ever looked for and dreamed about in a woman, both looks and personality-wise, faultless. We get on like a house on fire, constant chatting, flirting, shared interests, dreams. We kiss and it's incredible.

We end up spending most of the weekend together, at mine, at hers, the sex is mind-blowing and the best either of us have ever had. She opens up to me and says she thinks I might be the one, I say the same to her.


Then shit gets cray. She panics, pushes herself away, says she wants to go slow and start again from before we had sex, start dating properly and not rush into something, as she wants to make it work. I agree, obviously, it just got a bit crazy hot and heavy, let's chill.

Everyday we communicate, she is affectionate, planning things for the future (like way off like travelling together and things like that) and seems very keen. Then at night she basically freaks out, says she can't love me because she still loves this guy who destroyed her, she can't let him go, he's gone, I tell her. She says I'm too good for her, I deserve to be happy with someone else. Basically she has a breakdown and panics and runs away. The next morning we're back to normal, no mention of it.

I always had the best times with her. We were each others firsts for everything; we went all the way. I thought I was going to marry her for sure and we would always be together, we even are going to Cal State Fullerton together.

Last September, she got a job at Subway and her co-worker [24/M] took her phone number and started texting her. I thought it was weird but she told me she was just friends because she didn't know anyone else working there and it helped her fit in. I was kind of unsure about this whole situation, but I let it go because I trusted her. Later down the road, she would get weird texts from him asking if she was kinky. I knew that this was too far and I thought it had to stop, but she said he was just joking around. I asked her if I could trust her with this, and she said yes. Since we were together for 2.5 years I thought it was a no-brainer that she would be faithful. She always told me she loved me and said I was the one for her. 

Fast forward to March. Spring Break had just started and we were going to go to the beach. The day before we were going to go she texts me and says that she is grounded and cannot go to the beach and will lose her phone. Of course I wondered why so when I asked her she told me that it was because her parents found out again that we were still having sex. I missed her over spring break, as anyone would, and then school resumed and everything felt normal. She then started to tell me that she was feeling different in our relationship, and I had no idea why because I was always the perfect boyfriend to her and always put her first. I asked if I could fix it and she said she didn't know.

Now we are in to May. I find out that she is still texting him dirty stuff and he says that he wishes she could be sucking on [his] dick. Now I was pissed. I texted him to leave her alone and he comes back to tell me, how does it feel to go out with someone that doesn't love you and is cheating on you? My reaction was crazy. I couldn't believe it and I didn't. I texted her asking if it was true and she said no 4 times. On the 5th time I asked she said that she had sex with him and her parents knew this whole time.for a couple months, she cheated on me behind my back. She had to take a pregnancy test, I thought it was because we were having sex without a condom (she was on birth control), and it turned out it was because of him. So she bare-backed him, and I had oral with her after the fact. Kind of grosses me out that she told me all this stuff and just made me more angry.

What I came out to find was that the time she got grounded for having sex with me, it was really for having sex with him. She had been cheating on be back since November, going out to dinner and dates with him. I was devastated and started shouting and screaming at 1 in the morning. 

So it's been 2 months, and I feel like I can't get over it. I still see her as my girlfriend. We went on a camping trip for a week the summer before and it was the best time of my life. I absolutely loved everything about it and my image of her still remains that girl that would lay next to me camping and hold my hand til we both fell asleep; the one who went fishing with me in the rain and cuddled with me near the campfire.

Any help on getting over this? It was pretty rough on me, especially thinking I'd be with her forever. I feel like this is going to affect future relationships over trust.

This is not so much a problem I have but rather a question I want to ask to those of this subreddit.

I (m/22) have been with my girlfriend (f/21) for almost 2 years. I sincerely think that we are perfect for each other and I am happy to say that I believe that she agrees.

Now, I'm not saying I want to start planning this wedding tomorrow; I want to graduate with my masters and work as a teacher for some time. 

 However, the majority of the people I have talked to about potentially marrying this woman have all warned me about the possible danger of being with my first girlfriend for the rest of my life.

I sincerely love her as much as I did at the begining of our relationship, if not more so now.
So, I turn to you, the members of /r/relationships, for advice on this matter.

Thank you all, very much!

22632,Dating,3769ol,"Okay, so… this has been a terrible day for me, although to be fair the girl I met last night probably had it worse, and I have been agonizing over it for hours. I have work tomorrow, and damn, I need some anonymous help since I can’t ask my friends and I can't even sleep. Obvious throwaway.

Saturday night I went to my friend’s party, and there is usually a lot of drinking, drugs, and getting into trouble, though not nearly as bad as our college days (although now I’m rethinking that part). I’m not actually that into it, but a lot of my friends are in my work network, so I don’t want to abandon our relationship and risk our careers. I just try to do as little as possible, but stay “cool.”

However, something really terrible happened last night.

My friends are pretty good at getting girls to come normally, but since we live in a college town and the school year is over most of the girls are gone, and they could only wrangle a few of their coworkers. So, in a party of about thirty, there were about three girls, all interns.

One of them, who I’ll call Emily, clearly did not want to be there. She sat on the patio for most of the night trying to stop guys from hitting on her. I felt sympathetic, so I went over, and they did stop messing with her. She was a nice girl, and I won’t lie – she is actually rather cute despite being a little chubby – I found her attractive, but I didn’t want to get involved with anyone since I just broke up with my fiancé a few weeks ago. So really, all I was going to do was sit with her and talk, and I think she said she was an English major and that she wanted to leave, but was afraid her boss (my friend) would fire her. That’s when she got thirsty and got up to get a drink.

Well, at least one of my friends or their friends are assholes, because that drink was spiked. None of the guys ever drink juice, so maybe I should have realized something about it was off, but things started to unravel really quick.

She took a sip, grimaced, and put it down. I thought maybe they put alcohol in it, so I took a big gulp, declared that’s probably what is was, and then some asshole who I can’t remember went by and really badgered Emily for being a lightweight and pushed her to chug it. So she did.

Quickly she started to become incoherent, and so did I, though not nearly as much, and the next thing I remember is being in a bedroom and having sex with her. I can’t recall exactly what happened, but when I woke up the next morning we were definitely naked. I saw her wrists were red and I think I remember her crying and saying no, but I was just so out of it I kept going. There were also blood on the sheets, so I think she was a virgin.

I feel like a horrible human being, and I think I accidentally raped her. When she woke up she was disoriented, more than I was, and I was pretty fucked up myself. She cried, and then she asked if I used a condom, and well, I didn’t because I didn’t plan on having sex that night. My friend started banging on the door and she went and got her clothes, but I ripped them off of her, and she just started crying more.

I’ve never felt like such a big piece of shit in my life. Eventually my friend pushed open the door and seemed really pissed that I had sex in his bedroom and kicked us out. From there, Emily asked if we could go to the pharmacy to get Plan B (I guess I shouldn’t be surprised a virgin isn’t on birth control) because she didn’t have the money to buy it herself. So we got into my car, went to the store, she took it as soon as she got back into the car, and then I drove her to her apartment. The last thing she said to me before she walked up to her door was, “I don’t blame you,” but why wouldn’t she? Was she just too scared to do anything at that point?

I have no idea what to do from here.

22636,Dating,2qmdla,"Hey guys, I'm brand new to reddit so I hope I'm doing this right...I've heard good things about it so I figured I would give it a shot. Here goes:


About six months ago I had been seeing someone, and after about a month and a half she and I broke it off. She ended it with me for reasons that had nothing to do with our connection, since we both agreed at the end that we were still very attracted to each other but the timing for us to be together was poor. We then did not see each other for six months as I was travelling, but we kept in touch almost daily and would reminisce on our times together, tell each other we missed each other, etc. etc., all seeming like things might work out when I got back.


While I was away she began casually seeing someone else, but said they were not at all exclusive and would be open to hooking up when I came home. I had not been looking for anything serious while I was away, so of course I still missed her and wanted to try and make things work when I got home since I am in a much better place in my life now than I was when we ended things. The day I arrived home, she invited me to come over her house, but obviously I was too tired. We postponed to the next day, and when I arrived at her house she was extremely excited to see me. We talked and proceeded to sleep together as if nothing had changed between us. I was feeling super optimistic at this point based on how happy she was to see me and of course based on the fact that we slept together again like the old times. Here's where it gets weird:


The next day we had dinner plans, so we got dinner and chatted like friends. She insisted on paying for me, which in my mind is something I do only if I tell a friend I'll be taking them out for a special occasion OR if it's someone I'm romantically interested in. So I took this as a good sign. After dinner I finally mustered up the courage to ask her where we might be headed, and her answer shocked me: she said she did not see a relationship ever forming out of this, and did not think we would be able to even give it a second shot at seeing each other again. She said she would still like to continue hanging out with me as in continue having casual sex, so we defined ourselves as friends with benefits. However, since then she has been flirting with me regularly (her initiating it), shown signs of being eager to hang out again, and texts me to chat and not just to set up a meeting time.


To me, these are breaking the boundaries of friends with benefits and are blurring the lines of FWB and casually dating. Am I wrong? Is this normal friends with benefits behavior? Help!

My ex broke up with me out of the blue and asked to see me in 90 days (3/10/14). After that he wanted to see me before Christmas to exchange gifts and that was a full meltdown of me crying and such. Since then we have spoken twice. Once on New Years Eve and last week.


Last week we had a long conversation (nearing 3 hours) where he broke down told me that he may have an addiction to porn and excessively masturbating since he was a child and that's what he wanted to tell me in ninety days. My ex told me he needs time, he can't think of being anyone now or in the future, &amp;amp; that I am a trigger. I told him I will wait for him, even though I don't know what's going to happen.
 

My ex is not seeking out treatment and is self treating through forums and abstaining, but I don't know the details. My ex told me he loves me, not a day goes by that he doesn't think about me, and don't ever question that he loves me. But my ex needs space and time, and a friend too that I'm willing to give to him.


I don't know if I have unrealistic expectations that my ex and I will get back together. It kills me that my ex and I are apart, loving each other and we are both in pain. My ex needs help that I hope he gets and I want a relationship that may not be possible. It's hard to respect my ex's space but I'm trying. Blocked on social networking and avoid each other even though I pass his house everytime I go to work. I don't dare block his number because my ex told me he would always pick up the phone for me.

How do I deal with this unknowing? I openly picked this option knowing the risks and it's like I know what it's going to be like, but I feel like he's the one.

22647,Breakups,2og64d,"Hello 

sorry for wall of text but im not sure how ells to write it all.

My gf left me about 1.5 months ago now and I am struggling with how to deal with it all as I am worried about her.

we met online last year and she was a mess with lots of depression issues( she’s on anti-depresents)  and physical issues from previous boyfriends who were violent and possessive and also some other experiences I would rather not say as it’s a bit personal.

During our relationship i tried very hard to help her work out all the issues she had, i didn't have a job and I studied online so she was like a job for me and for the most part of our relationship she improved mentally and physically and we were very happy.

close to the end of our relationship she started talking to a guy (he’s 24 also and has a few kids already) that added her on Facebook whom she had gone to school with for a short period of time they started talking a lot but I was fine with that as she does have many male friends, but then her personality started to change and she became very blunt with me stopped talking to me as much and started to get angry at me for things that would never had been an issue before.


That went on for around 5 days then she accidentally called me instead of him and she said she was going for dinner with him I got a bit annoyed as she was going behind my back and it was an accident that she called otherwise id never had known.


The next time I saw her I asked why she’s acting so strange while we were at dinner, she broke down crying saying she didn't know if she still loved me. I took her home and we sat on my bed and talked and she asked me what she should do I didn’t know what to say as I loved her and told her to stay with me and we can work it out but she didn’t want that as she wanted to be free to do what she wanted she also said she felt like she cheated on me as she had hugged him and thought about kissing him but didn’t when they went to dinner. 

she also said she was leaving as i had gained a little weight and she left i lied to her about all the dreams we had for our future, but she wanted me to be her best friend and cried and begged when I said I can’t be her friend anymore.        



We said we would take time apart for 2 weeks but after 1 week it was obvious that she had no intentions to stay with me and was already going out every weekend and getting drunk (something she never wanted to do with me or even enjoyed as she had anxiety issues around people) that worried me as she’s on heavy anti-depressants, so we broke up and I tried to stay a friend but as you know that’s not possible as I was heartbroken and stupid so all I did was talk about what we had and all the memories.


I stopped talking to her for 4 days and in that time she harassed me with calls and texts that she hurt herself (she wanted me to nurture her like i had done when we were togther as her parents never did)and that she wants to know I’m ok but I resisted until she changed her relationship status to the other guy (it was his idea to change it as he was telling her what to do), this pulled at a heart string and I broke and she got mad at me for not talking to her or asking if she was ok.


I saw her one last time 2 days later when she came to get things she left at my house we sat down and spoke and she told me that she’s not into the other guy and she still loves me and misses me we also kissed a few times but she wouldnt hold my hand, she said that had I not have responded to the relationship status she was going to say she was pregnant to try and get me to talk again, I asked she change her relationship status back but she said she liked it but she has no intentions to date him. 


A week later I was doing fine and slowly getting over it all even though we were still talking a little and I was even going to see her again until I sent a text saying I was happy that she’s happier without me as all I wanted was for her to have fun and I meant it. 


But apparently this made her feel guilty and she went off at me that I guilt trip her and I keep poking and poking and she can’t take it anymore and we should go separate ways that was 3 weeks ago.


Last week I saw a msg on facebook ( she’s still got me as a friend and I haven’t been able to remove her) where she said happy bday followed by “love her and him &lt;3”  this made me break down and for the past week I have been crying and totally out of it as she told me she had no feelings for him and i felt she did cheat on me emotionaly and lied to me.


I found out he also suffers from depression, schizophrenia and has tried suicide also like she had, this has me worried as it would explain why she changed so much when she started spending time with him and they also go drinking all the time. 


I’m worried about her and myself as I’m not sure how to let it all go as I still do care about her as I helped her so much with all her issues and she made so much progress but now it’s like she never met me and acts worse than she did before we were together I’m scared he will hurt her or she will try and self-harm again but I know I can’t help and its driving me insane as I still care about her even though I know she’s gone.


I just wish I could get over this and move on as for the past week all I have done is cried and broken down even while out with friends in the city, but after helping her for so long I don’t want to see her fall down again and her family doesn’t even know the severity of her issues and she doesn’t talk to them about any of it.

Earlier this year I met a girl at my college, we instantly hit it off and became quite close friends very quickly. She had a boyfriend when we met, so although I was attracted to her, our relationship was platonic. 

Cut forward a few months, she breaks up with her boyfriend, and we become closer and more flirtatious. Eventually (after a few weeks) we confess to liking each other as more than friends. She however was upfront about not wanting to jump into anything so soon after her breakup. Fair enough I said, and I explained I was willing to let her get her head sorted before we moved on. 

Cut forward to now, some weeks later. Right now we're temporarily apart by distance, but we still speak daily, and we talk often about how we wish we were (physically) together. Essentially we speak to each other as if we were a couple and I feel for her a great deal.

Here's where things have put worry in me. Today she tells me a few weeks ago she hooked up with one of her friends. She admitted she liked him somewhat, and to some extent still does. She doesn't know what that means, and still isn't ready to commit to anything serious with me. 

It hurt me a lot more than I let on to learn this. Part of me wants to give her space and not be pushy, but the other half felt kinda distraught and wanting to ask for a more concrete explanation from her. 

Does it sound like she's leading me (and possibly this other guy) on? Should I even be involved with her if she's so confused? Should I just give her space and stick it out?
I'm worried the more I fall for her the harder it will be if nothing comes of it.

**Previous Incidents**

1. We've been friends for a little over a year now, at first we didn't really talk much. I had a crush on her but that was about it. So last May I asked her out for the first time, she responded that she sees me as a brother and couldn't date me. So I moved on. 

2. Then back in October of last year we started hanging out more often also while we've been hanging out she has shown body language like she has interest in me. When I finally asked her out for the second time, this time she said that she didn't currently want to date anyone so I accepted it and we were just friends. 

3. Jump ahead to last December, she is still showing body language that says that she has interest in me. So I confront her again, and this time she tells me that she could never have romantic feelings for me. So I move on again and stop talking to her.

* So we've started talking again, this is the 4th time now. I also know at this point I’m most likely insane We start back texting and hanging out like we used to.

---
**Jump to last Thursday**

* Then last week we had lunch together, not a date. But we talk about our past and childhood over lunch, then afterwards we head over to my place and we continue to talk. Moving into more touchy subjects about our past and thoughts.
 
* Then eventually we get to the root cause of what I think has been perpetuating her interest in me. Ok, so we will agitate each other and play fight a lot, not violent but just play fighting. Well as it turns out She really enjoys this it’s one of her turn-ons, I did not know until now. My roommates or friends would always break us up if we started so it never really went anywhere.

* This is also where I find out that she really doesn't have an idea of what a relationship is, she believes that she just doesn't feel anything towards relationships
 
* Well after this we both start freaking out and thinking that our friendship is over so we move to different sides of the apartment. I'm lying on the couch, she ends up walking over to the couch and I grab her arm and pull her down and hug her. Then I pull her down again, but this time we kiss.

* This is where things got interesting so afterwards it was one of those that just happened moments. I asked her what she thought, she replied Well you're a good kisser, so I pulled her in and we started making out.

---

**Last Thursday - The Aftermath:** 

* Ok, she starts saying that that was a mistake, so I start asking why. But she cannot give me a straight answer. Well I start to take her home because she has work and on the way she starts explaining the other people she has kissed and that her last roommate and her would cuddle and kiss but he stopped talking to her when she moved to a new apartment. So I am utterly confused at this point as to why she is doing this but I listen to her.
* Well I suggest that why don't we go on a date, if she's not interested after a few dates then we just go on our separate ways. Well once again she says no, this time saying that our personalities are too similar, to which I point out all of the flaws in her logic as she is doing this and points out that this is one of the reasons that I think we could work out because we can call each other and help each other out. But alas she still doesn't think it will work out.
* Now she introduces a new curveball, she tells me that she may not even have interest in me after tomorrow. That she tends to lose interest in people after kissing them. 
* So before I drop her off I tell her to think about it overnight and to talk to me about it the next day.

---
**The day after**

* So we meet up at her place to talk. This is where she says that she still thinks that it wouldn't work out. So I ask why, she doesn't have a good answer. 
* Then I ask her if she is still interested in me to which she does not give a response, so I assume yes and she does not counter. 
* So I insist that she just go on a few dates once again and if things don't work out then we just go our separate ways, but at least we would have tried. This time she says that it was a reasonable request but she can't really date anyone at the moment. 
* A few mins later she looks at me and tells me that to her I look 12, and that she sees me like a brother. Repeating the first time I asked her out But she still wants to be friends. Well she had to go to work again, so we parted ways.

---
**Sunday**

* She had originally planned on coming over and hanging out at my apartment, and cooking food She loves to cook for others.
* Well she doesn't respond much and when she does she is really short with the responses. So I ask her if I am bothering her by trying to keep talking to her frequently, and that she had been being short with me.
* She replied that she was trying to build a barrier, because anytime that she thinks about what is happening that she starts to feel sick. She keeps thinking that it feels more and more like she kissed her brother.
* At this point I try to dig down to see why she sees me like a brother at first she doesn't know, then she says that it is because the main reason she has so much patience for me is because it feels like we are siblings.

So that is where I am at currently, I have no idea what to do. I have a sick feeling in my gut that there is nothing I can do.
   
**tl;dr**: I've been talking to a girl for about a year now, and it has been a hodgepodge of Various reason and Excuses as to why she could not date me, or that she doesn't think it would work out.

Question 1: So should i just give up?  

Question 2: If not, Any suggestions?","Me [24M] with my friend [19F] for almost a year, comes up with random excuses and various reason why she doesn't want to date.",0.0,False,0.0,6.0,1422866561.0,/r/relationships/comments/2ui0bb/me_24m_with_my_friend_19f_for_almost_a_year_comes/,Romantic

solid advice.




---
---
last year I was in a relationship with my first serious boyfriend A [23 M] who I also lost my virginity to. We lived 3 hours away

from each other, I was going to  university and he was working in the competitive entertainment industry back in a city where my

 family lived.  Our relationship was strained from the beginning because initially he refused to commit to me because he didn't want

a girlfriend because of how busy he was trying to make it in a competitive career so I took it in stride and since we were not

exclusive this is when I met B [23 m] at a small party a friend was throwing. B was his roommate. 








---
---
At this time B and his ex [25 f] of 4 years were broken up for 6 months as she already graduated college and living hours from him

 and had started a career and he was still in undergrad trying to get his shit together, The distance hurt their relationship. I don't 

know much except that there were many factors involved. Although I didn't think much of the first night we met, because I 

had a lot of feelings for A, the few other times we ended up hanging out I'd never experienced such amazing chemistry with

 someone and we started going on dates. 









---
---
I ended up telling A about B  because I wanted to be honest. Even though we weren't an official couple I still wanted to be 

upfront with him about me dating other people. He was upset and gave me an ultimatum, I had a night to choose who I wanted. I

 knew B wasn't interested in a relationship because he was still dealing with his breakup and was moving in less than a month and I

 had grown very close to A a lot quicker than I had imagined I would. A knows more about my personal life, about my dark secrets,

 the abusive childhood I had, etc. A knows more about me than anyone else. he's someone I could confide in and vice versa so 

there was this deep bond there that I didn't have with B and so I chose A. I cut things off with B and we go our separate ways. 

This didn't mean A and I officially became a couple, it just meant that A expected me to cut off all contact with B. 









---
---

Fast forward months in and A and I became an official couple but we are always fighting. We break up and me and B get back in 

contact at some point after my breakup. He invited me to visit him where he's living with his grandfather and thus entails 4 months

 of  us seeing each other. We have amazing chemistry in and out of the bedroom. His grandfather adores me and when I wasn't 

around he'd always ask B when I was coming to visit, if B had spoken to me, etc. I grew very close to them both. 









---
---
However my ex A gets back in contact with me and we are seeing each other but without any exclusivity. I tell B because I want 

to be upfront. He's not 100% okay with it, but he respects that decision because there's no exclusivity between us either and I 

wouldn't doubt his ex and him were also in contact.  So A and I are  not together exclusively but we aren't fully ready to move on

 from one another and I am seeing B at the same time and he knows that I'm not fully ready to move on from A, and accepts that.

A doesn't  know I'm seeing B because A made it clear that 1. if he knew I was seeing other guys it would be over and 2. he said 

he'd  rather not know because when I've told him in the past i was seeing B or when he broke up with me and he found me on 

facebook and saw my profile picture of me and B he felt like i was just trying to rub it in his face so I decide to not tell A. 








---
---

One night I get a ticket for speeding at 3 am when I was going to see B. Have to pay a fee at the court in that town 

(which is hours from where i live) the following week. I forget about it until the last day of the deadline. Frantic I ask B if I can

 drive there that night to his place so I can take care of ticket in the morning. He is acting shady by being hesitant to let me go 

over, I call him out on it but he lets me stay at his place in the end. I get there and I reject his hugs and kisses. I ask him about

his shady behavior turns out his ex bought expensive tickets to a music festival and wants him to go with her. He said yes,

 he's going the next day after school to spend the weekend with her. I get upset and decide I don't want to continue anymore 

with the relationship. It had been a month or so of me and A being back in contact but after realizing it was never going to work

 between us because of how busy he was, I ended things with him exactly when B's ex wants to give their relationship another 

shot. So we fight about it because I don't want to lose him and I realize i'm being a hypocrite so I decide that the best thing is 

to just have NC so I can move on and so that he and his ex can figure out what they want. 








---
---
We go 6 months of NC and me and A  get back together becuase he says he'll try harder and promises he'll work on 

communication during conflicts. I don't know much about B except that him and his ex get back together officially  maybe a month after i initiated nc. 









---
---

After 6 months of nc with B  me and A break up for the last time. He had gotten much better at communication and was trying more 

than ever but I had been sexually assaulted by someone I trusted and I grew to be overly clingy and a constant emotional wreck. Up 

until then i hadn't had very many sexual partners and viewed sex as something special you share with someone but after my assault

 I saw sex differently and I felt used and was paranoid that every guy was only out to use me for sex. This compounded with our 

rocky beginnings of me equating not hearing from A with A giving me the cold shoulder as punishment whenever we'd fight led to me

 to accusing A of using me only for sex if I didn't hear from him within a few hours of me calling or texting him.









---
---

 After him  continuously assuring me that it was because he was in the middle of work when I'd call or text he grew tired of my 

emotional  outbursts and accusations and I needed support that I couldn't find in him so I ended it because I could feel myself driving

 A away and  it wasn't fair to him. i spent a good deal working out and even though I didn't seek professional help, I got a lot of 

support from  other sexual assualt victims from here on reddit. I was starting to feel good about myself. 









---
---




Eventually B and I reconnected as friends but it eventually turned more romantic. I learned that his ex had kissed another guy 

because she didn't feel like he was giving her enough attention (long distance dating) while they were together and he broke up

with her.  We picked up where we left off and it almost felt like no time had passed between us. This time though we've grown closer.

 It makes me realize that what we had before the 6 month nc was  more infatuation and excitement of something new than anything 

else and the way we handled our situation was very poorly done, but this time around it seems like we've grown closer in more than

 just a physical sense. 









---
---




I haven't talked to my ex in a long time because it wasn't healthy and for the past 5 months me and B have been seeing each other

again. He was honest and told me he didn't know what he wanted. His ex was actively trying to pursue him again and wanted

to make things work and he wasn't ready to forgive her. She's ready for a family and the next step and he isn't and he's not sure

 if she's who he wants in the grand scheme of things. Basically he's a young 23 year old man, he doesn't know what he wants and 

they are in two very different places. He tells me that he realizes he can be just as happy with someone who isn't her and I represent 

what he's not sure he's willing to give up for her. 








---
---







Things have been good between us but it still makes me really uncomfortable when I notice her or her family members comment 

on his things or comment about him. He never seems to respond but I don't know to what extent he replies back to her. We don't 

have each other added on facebook (which I like because we can have separate lives) I just know from what i've seen that's public. 

It makes me uncomfortable that she actively is pursuing him and he hasn't cut off contact with her. 







---
---








I have no right to ask him to stop talking to her and I would never put him in a position to feel pressured to choose so I wrote him a 

letter tellin ghim it made me uncomfortable and that because the situation has been the same for over a year now that perhaps the

 best thing for us would be to cut off contact. Im studying abroad on the other side of the world right now and I told him that this 

would be a good opportunity to have nc so we can do our own thing and figure out what we want. I told him that i don't think he's 

going to figure out what he wants if he lets his ex stay in contact with him as often as she does. 





---
---
I also said that I think that if he still doesn't know what he wants after this much time then I don't think i'm what he really wants 

right  now. I told him I've tried to be patient and i'm okay with not having any title because I feel secure in my relationship with my 

partner if the feelings, chemistry, and dynamic are real, so I trust him even without a title, but that I can't do this anymore with his

 ex still in constant contact with him. We've been doing this for over a year now and I'm finally emotionally available and I finally have

 no contact with my ex A and I don't want to be stuck in this place anymore of baggage with exes.





---
---
I told him i wasn't looking for commitment but that I'm at a place where I'm emotionally available and I don't want to stress over 

someone who isn't in that same place as me. I wished him a happy early birthday (its coming up in november) and that i hoped it was

 better than his birthday last year and I told him that i hope at some point in the future we can be friends. 







---
---

He wrote me back saying his birthday would be better if I was there and then a few hours later he writes back that it was 

interesting that i sent this to him because around the same time i sent it he and his ex had a heart to heart. He said they had a heart 

to heart about the possibility of a future together and that they both agreed that they don't do distance well together. He said that

she said she won't contact him anymore as long as the distance is in place and he then said he didn't really know what else to say 

about that. Then he said how much he missed me. 







---
---

 On one hand her not contacting him anymore is what i wanted. On the other hand they were discussing the possibility of a future 

together. What happens if she finds a job closer to him or vice versa? If distance is what's keeping them apart that doesn't mean he 

doesn't want her. I guess i'm a little upset about the fact that the possibility of a future together is still a very real threat for me and 

I don't want what happened last time to happen again. I don't want to be surprised if they decide to work on things again. I don't 

want to invest too much of my feelings. I'm at a point where I'm not in love with him but i'm so close and it's only because of the fear

of them getting back together that stops me from allowing myself to feel more. 







---
---

I feel like this is the right time for me to invest more in what we have because now she isn't contacting him but then part of me is 

convinced I should not reply back because they were discussing the possibility of a future together and that to me sounds like a red 

flag, like it's not over between them yet but i don't know if that's just me being paranoid and reading too much into it all. Normally I 

wouldn't put up with this for so long but when it's just us and we can get away from the baggage that exists for a few days and we

can just be together and enjoy each other's company there's something amazing and special there.







---
---

 I'm not saying that I can't find that sort of crazy chemistry with someone else but with the crazy chemistry that we have and the 

same history that drove us apart that has also created a weird but special bond between us makes it hard to let it all go.

**tl;dr**: me and a guy were seeing each other off and on for over a year during the time we were both in off and on tumultuous

 relationships with our LoTR SOs. We reconnected after 6 months of nc and we've grown closer. His ex still contacts him all the time 

and being uncomfortable with it and feeling like second place I told him that I thought nc between us was a good idea because over a

 year of this is too much and we both need to figure out what we want. He tells me his ex and him had a heart to heart about the 

possibility of a future together the same day i sent him my letter about nc and they agree they don't do well in long distance and so 

she said she won't contact him anymore as long as the distance is in place. He then tells me he misses me. Should I stay firm with no 

contact or should I invest more of myself into this with him? All that stood out to me were the words, ""discussing possibility of a 

future together"" and now i may be overthinking that 'they' might still be a thing in the future. I don't want to invest in someone who 

may still have a future with their ex.

22667,Breakups,2d6t4r,"I was seeing a girl for a couple months and got way too emotionally attached much too quickly. This caused me a lot of anxiety and I think caused me to do things that made me look insecure and desperate. I put a lot of pressure on her and made myself unattractive, I'm sure. Prior to this I was doing a good job working on my issues internally and things between us seemed to be going fine.

Eventually she ended it after I had revealed quite a bit too much about my worry and almost ended it with her myself. She gave me the classic sort of it's not you it's me excuse. Said I was a nice guy and whatnot, which stung because I knew it was because I made myself look weak and had killed the interest she had in me.

After she ended it, I tried twice to get her to try again, with no success. More excuses of why we could not on her part. I stopped talking to her after the second rejection, that was two weeks ago.

I haven't stopped thinking about the mistakes I made and how I didn't even give myself the opportunity to see if we were compatible. I liked this girl and I haven't moved on yet, I want a chance to repair what I broke, and I don't want to be that weak, needy person anymore.

Since we are coworkers as well, we both agreed on keeping this as a secret. 

We started to go out, we even had a long weekend at the seaside, but never felt the extreme feeling of love, although she was constantly asking how do I feed towards her. I always felt more than just a sex-relationship, even more than just friendship, but not as much as love. 

Only untill last week, when I realised from the depths of my emotions that I truly in love with her. I was thinking a lot, whether should I tell this to her or not? The outcome was, she felt something was going on with me and forced me to express (wasn't hard since i truly felt that) my emotions.

A week passed, she started evading me, no hugging, not holding my hands, and I asked what is going on? She replied she doesn't know, she feel she is obligated to satisfy my need in a relationship, which is hard for her when she is working her ass off. She needs time. 

A few days have passed, she started to become the same as before, except that she is speaking in a manner like she is single. I know we haven't put our relation on a display, but something was more before.

Recently, I admitted to liking her, she said she knew and pointed out she's only here for a few more weeks (she goes to an out of state university).

A couple of days later, I decided to push the issue some more to see if there's something more wrong with us ever dating. She said she prefers friends and told me that nothing between us would happen. I asked why and she said that she rarely likes someone romantically and that I treat her like her brother does, who is also my age. But in the same conversation, she also admitted to not really knowing me that well, so maybe there might be something there to see if she's wrong.

I still plan to continue to be her friend whether or not I might ever be able to date her, but I just can't help but wonder if I'm just looking at this all wrong or maybe there's actually some chance there if I got to know her better.

22677,Dating,332cts,"We fell for each other about 4 months ago. She was in a relationship at the time, which would usually go against my morals but we didn't plan for it to happen. We kept things under control and I don't think we stepped into cheating territory, but we were definitely more than friends for a number of months.

Her stance was always that if she'd met me at a better time (if she was single) she'd love to pursue something with me. She told me she'd never fell for anyone so quickly before because she's so cautious about letting people close to her (trust issues).

Basically we liked each other a lot and I always had this idea in my head that if she ever became single, something would probably end up happening between us two.

Anyway she ended up breaking up with her boyfriend a few weeks ago (emotionally manipulative/abusive + trying to control her life, nothing to do with me) and I guess I was happy about it. Not just because it hurt me to like a girl who was in a relationship, but because she's my closest friend and it infuriated me to see someone trying to change who she is.

Now while she went through the whole breakup, she was pretty distant with me. She's explained now that it was because of the relationship issues (I didn't know what the problem was at the time) and that she'd like to spend some time with me now that she doesn't have to answer to anyone.

We ended up spending a day together (over Skype playing video games haha) and got talking about some personal stuff. We went over what happened between them, how her and I feel about each other/how we felt about each other and a bunch of other stuff. I told her I still really like her but I understand she's in a tough position right now.

She told me she holds me close to her heart and that I'm one of the best things to ever happen to her. She said that because of her relationship, she had to put down her romantic feelings for me towards the end (despite telling me she was in love with me only 3 weeks before it ended between them) and that right now she doesn't feel more than friends with anyone, but she doesn't know what the future holds and couldn't give me a solid answer regarding her feelings about me. She felt that I was looking for commitment (Yes I like you and I want to pursue you, or no I no longer have feelings for you and never will) which isn't true, I just wanted to know if she still had anything left in her heart for me. When joking a little later, she made a hint something along the lines of who knows, maybe _someone_ will come and sweep me off my feet and cause me to make hasty decisions again (she always jokes that I'm hasty, and always said that I swept her off her feet - this was directly aimed at me).

At first I was okay to hear her stance. I took it literally as _right now_ she doesn't see herself as more than friends with anyone but she _did_ make a point of wanting to spend more time with me which gave me the idea she wanted to pick things up again. Now that I'm thinking back over the conversation, I'm starting to see it as more of a rejection.

Anyone had a similar conversation with someone they liked? I'm not sure if she genuinely meant that she doesn't feel that way for anyone _right now_ or that she just doesn't see _me_ that way anymore and doesn't want to ruin our friendship over it.

This is really weird. We've spent time together (mostly online) since then but every time it seems kinda clinical. I can tell she's holding back from showing too much affection and I don't feel like she really means it when she says Thanks for the company or whatever afterwards.

I feel like any affection is falling on deaf ears because she doesn't want to hear it. I've also tried giving her the space she so often desires and just not spoken to her until she speaks to me. When I do that though, she can tell something's wrong and she starts to worry.

The only real reason I'm writing this is because I get mixed messages. She's trying to be clear that she's not in love with anyone at the moment but she's also making an effort to spend a little more time with me. I can't tell if she actually wants to spend quality time with me or if she's just avoiding feeling harsh about rejecting(?) me. The reason I question her motives about spending time with me is that she's also spent a little time with her ex (video games etc) because she feels bad for him and doesn't want to be harsh towards him (her words). I can understand where she's coming from but I'm sure you can understand that I don't want her to be spending time with me out of pity. She does seem more affectionate in the way we communicate though so again, mixed messages.

Where do I go now? I want her to fall back in love with me but obviously that can't be forced. She's so important to me and I don't want to lose her but I feel like our friendship is on the line here. Was she playing me while she had a relationship to fall back on? I guess I can see the whole Having your cake and eating it thing but try and believe me when I say what we had was pretty real. 

tldr: Have a friend I've been more than friends with for months now. She was already with someone when we fell for each other and I always expected her to grow closer to me if she ever became single. Now she's actually single I don't feel she's responding to affection in the same way and I'm doubting if her feelings for me are real.

22685,Dating,34sxed,"So I became friends with this girl about two months ago and I quite enjoy being around her. We get along very well and I started developing feelings for her. I wanted to ask her on a date but it's toward the end of the semester and I didn't want to attempt to start something when we'll have to go away for 3 months. However, I decided that I would tell her how I felt before then. 

There were a lot of festivities on our campus this weekend and the two of us spent pretty much the entire time together, both sober and drunk. At a party we had some beers and talked the entire time. We were only a little tipsy so both of us were coherent and able to accurately express our emotions. As we left to head somewhere else I decided to tell her that I had feelings for her. 

She said that she wasn't really interested in me. She went through a break up not too long ago and said she was kind of interested in being single for a while. She suspected that I liked her for a while and apparently didn't think it was awkward or would affect our ability to be friends. Also she apparently has been talking a lot to somebody she met on Tinder recently. This I find a bit odd because she doesn't hook up with people (hooking up being casual sex) and she is a virgin but whatever. I eventually got his name and would look him up on facebook. He's nothing too special, I'm definitely smarter but I have to admit, he's very good looking. I'm in for some competition. 

Of course, as the night went on the two of us had more drinks. We didn't black out and we were aware of what we were saying and were doing. After all, we remembered everything that happened when we talked the following day. **This is where the signals get mixed.** We start cuddling and holding each other a lot. I rub pretty much every non-sexual part of her body. She was very touchy feely too. We walked around holding hands or putting them on each others hips or shoulders. We wound up kissing each other a handful of times and eventually made out a little before saying goodnight. Again, we were both fully aware of what was happening so nobody was being taken advantage of and I always asked her if she was comfortable. 

Now I know people get more affectionate to each other when drunk, but we weren't too drunk. I feel like it didn't make us do things we normally wouldn't do, but just easier to do it. 

So we saw each other the next day and things were pretty normal. Eventually last night came up because we really both did have a lot of fun. When I asked her how she felt about it she said she really enjoyed it but wasn't sure if our affections would happen if we were sober. Well, at least I went from Not interested to Unsure! 

Also another thing, she shit talks her ex-boyfriend a lot around me and has been doing this for quite some time. Not too sure what that means but hopefully you guys do. 

As things stand right now. She'll be meeting the Tinder guy for an hour or two tomorrow. Not sure if they are just friends but she seems to be considering him. They only met once before. Me and she will be watching a movie together later this week however. I want to try and make an advance during then. I want to try and see if she'll be okay with cuddling and holding each other when sober. 

So guys, how should I go about this? 

**TL;DR: Interested in a friend, have a lot of fun together. Said I liked her, she wasn't interested in me but then we got drunk and expressed a lot of affection. Now she's not really sure if interested or not. Still friends, not awkward. She shit talks her ex a lot around me.

22689,Infidelity,28hua5,"To begin with, let me say that the relationship I have with my boyfriend is not *normal*. We are best friends, high school sweethearts and have been together off-and-on for almost 12 years.  

Only last year did we decide to take the next step and move in together and things were a little rocky to start, but open communication lines have improved things over the last few months. There are few secrets between us.  

Here's how it went down: I came home from work last night and used his computer in our front room because it's hot as balls and that's where the AC is. Nothing big there, we use each other's computers all the time. He has a million things open on his desktop, including iTunes, Spotify, and his text messages. (We both have Macs.)  

So as I'm browsing the internet or whatever I'm doing, I hear the little *tink* of text messages coming in and I see that they're from his ex. He is at work at this time; he works a second-shift position. A bit of backstory: she and I used to be friends, but are no longer because she dated him, basically. They still talk as friends, but I and all of my friends don't trust her because we know she still has feelings for my boyfriend.  

She made these feelings pretty plain to him in text messages that he shared with me over the weekend, and we both agreed that she obviously didn't want to be his friend.

The text messages are (obviously) not text messages that they should be sending to one another: she mentions her need for oral sex, he mentions he wonders if she still tastes the same, etc., she mentions that he should come over and rectify her situation.  

They both go silent for a while until it's his time to leave work. I've texted him a couple of times at this point, but nothing to indicate that I knew what he might be doing. Around the time he would normally be home, he texts her that he's outside her house, and despite other texts, I don't hear from him until he comes home about two hours later.  

I ask him where he's been and he does mention that he went to her house, but that he also got drinks after work. I decide not to say anything about it as I'm not a confrontational person, so we shower and go to bed.  

This morning, I'm up early because I can't get it off of my mind and I don't want to confront him, but I NEED to confront him, so I wait for him to wake up and I tell him point blank that I was using his computer and I saw the messages come through.  

He looks at me like he was waiting for it. You want to know if I did? He asks me. I nod. He says yes. I ask why. He essentially says that he wanted one last hurrah before settling in with me for good. We are weeks away from signing the lease to the loft of our dreams.  

I managed to not collapse into a ball of tears in front of him because I am angry. VERY angry. We have married and non-married friends in similar relationships to ours, and none of them have ever wanted 'one last hurrah'. He apologized. I told him that it was time to break off contact with her, and he agreed, even as he realizes that it will be difficult to prove to me.  

I'm not ready to forgive him yet, but this goes against every fiber in my body. I've never been angry with him for longer than a day, but he's never done anything this bad before. This is the first time he's cheated on me, and my trust is betrayed. I'm hurt (duh). I want to rage and storm at him, I have so many more questions to ask him now that I've had time to clear my head a bit, but because of our schedules, I won't really see him or have time for that until tomorrow night.

22692,Breakups,26c9w8,"I'm not sure where to begin... My ex and I didn't have the best foundation for our relationship, but I loved her more than anything.


Our relationship had a rocky start 4 years ago because I (stupidly) cheated on her and began going out with the girl I cheated on her with (I know, I'm a fucking scumbag). Anyway, after I had broken up with the girl I cheated on my ex with, I started dating my ex again (let's just call her T for simplicity's sake). She forgave me and T and I had a great relationship. It was so perfect. She was just like me, we'd hang out, play video games, watch the same shows, and best of all she truly made me laugh. I loved being with her and she loved being with me, it seemed like neither of us could get enough of each other.

After graduating high school I went to the States for Uni but she remained in our home country (far away from the States). We tried long distance for a while but it didn't work out and we eventually broke up again. After dating multiple girls, I realized that none of them could even hold a candle to T. It dawned on me that we were perfect together and I should have never let her go. I spoke to her right before I came back to our home country for summer break and she agreed to take me back. Things were even better than before and she decided to move to the US after summer and go to my university, I was over the fucking moon.

But, during that summer something happened that just shook me to my core. She cheated on me with someone else. It came as a shock to me because I thought we were completely devoted to each other, and I was the only guy she had ever been with. I seriously contemplated suicide for a while. She apologized and begged for me to take her back. We reconciled and moved on with our relationship. Things were great but they were different... I didn't trust her now. There would the occasional freak out episodes on my behalf when she wouldn't answer my texts, but she learned to cope with them and was more than willing to reassure me how much she loved me and was devoted to me whenever I was in doubt. She was amazing, even when I started to lose it.

Fast forward a year, T and I are finishing up our first year together at Uni and everything was amazing. She acclimated really well and even got into a sorority (despite my hatred for them, I was more than happy that she got in). Also, for the first time in my life, I was actually doing well in all my classes. So well, in fact, that I decided to apply to a top 30 school (which I was sure I wouldn't get into) which is only 40 minutes away from our campus. To my surprise I got in! I made sure it was ok with T if I went before I applied. I was willing to not go if she wanted me to stay. But she was happy for me and we agreed we'd try to see each other every week.

I'm in my first semester at my new college and I'm suffering from severe depression and anxiety. I grew detached from everything. Suicide was a daily thought exercise. I'm not calling or visiting T as much as I used to, she begins to feel I'm losing interest in her even though I reassure her that I'm just going through some tough times and that I still love her and that I need her. My depression worsens and I try and take my own life. I don't succeed and am put in a psychiatric hospital for a while. My girlfriend was with me every step of the way when I left the hospital, and was nothing but supportive, but her worries about me becoming detached from her only grow. Eventually, the first semester at my new school is over and we both head back to our home country. We have a nice relaxing time, and for the first time in a while, the thought of suicide hadn't crossed my mind at all.

We decide that we're going to stay in on new year's eve and watch movies and just chill (we both don't like going out to parties and stuff). Suddenly, the night before new year's eve T tells me that she wants to go clubbing with a friend. I told her I really didn't want to go. But she really wanted to for some reason (completely out of character). Also she had just dyed her hair blonde (also pretty out of character for her). In the end she wouldn't budge and decided to go out without me. Needless to say (as I was in a severe depressive/anxious state) I kept sending her texts about how worried I was that she was with someone else. No replies until maybe around 3 AM. The next day I ask her to come over because I wanted to see what was going on because she was being a little distant.

She breaks up with me on January 1. She claimed that she was unhappy in our relationship because I didn't pay enough attention to her when I moved. I know what you're going to say, and yes I also think that she definitely found someone else. I'm numb at first but then it settled in. Horror. Horror, sadness, loneliness, worthlessness, anger... Just a concoction of all the negative emotions. 

I go back to university. Eventually, the weight of losing her becomes too much to bear and I make another attempt on my life. This attempt was triggered after I wished her a happy birthday (which is two days before mine) and I receive no reply on my birthday. I wake up and decide to go back home and take a sabbatical from uni for this semester. Now here I am.

I blame myself. It's all my fault. I cheated on her first and I pushed her away with my anxiety and lack of confidence. Not a day goes by that I don't think about ending my life. I'm crying as I type this because even just the thought of her completely shatters me. I fucked up and I'm just looking for some guidance/help. She comes back to our country soon and all I want to do is go see her and talk to her. That's all I want to do. I don't know what i'm expecting to get out of it but I just want to see her and show her how much I miss her and how much I still love her. I can't sleep because all I can honestly think of is finding a way to take my own life without any pain. It's flooding my mind and I just want it to stop. I know I'm asking a lot of you, Reddit, but please help. I don't know what to do...

22694,Infidelity,2eewhi,"My wife is a personal assistant for a very successful businessman.  She's been working closely with him for around 5 years and I suspect that something more significant than work is happening between them.  For the past year or so she's been going on business trips once a week (each month) with her boss. She speak kindly of him very often.  Each rare instance where I've had the chance to meet him in person, he basically ignores me and dominates my wife's attention.  Even without the business trips, they spend an absurd amount of time together.  Sometimes she'll get home 4 AM because they were working late.  What kind of work needs to be done at 4 AM?!? 

Then there's the jewelry.  Last week my wife was asking me to set aside some money to buy her a necklace (1.5 carat for around 5k).  I told her I would do my best and keep the necklace in mind when there was a special occasion (birthday, anniversary, etc.).  Three days later, she's posting a picture of the necklace on Instagram saying Look what [Boss] got me! What the fuck?  When I talked to my wife about and told her she can't accept a gift this expensive she said that it wasn't a big deal.  Apparently, this fucker has been buying my wife shit for years.  Half the stuff that she claimed to have purchased with her own money was purchased by her boss.  I was furious when she told me. She said she lied because she expected this reaction.  After I blew off some steam I straight up asked her if there was anything going on between them. Of course not, honey.  You know you're the only guy for me. I'm calling bullshit.

We were both very caring and made each other laugh and never ran out of conversation. If I had to describe what I look for in a boyfriend, he is it. I know that sounds like I'm overly idealising him, but he's smart, funny, kind, thoughtful, driven and amazing in bed. He's my best friend.



We'd never really talked about long term plans until fairly recently, because I'm not the type of girl who's in a hurry to get married or move in. I didn't want to put any pressure on him or the relationship when what we had was already so great. But more recently we both started talking about things. We worked out we were on the same page about having kids, and he even wants them a bit sooner than I was thinking - great! Fantastic.



But he said we might have an issue about where to live. I've always said I don't want to live abroad (I moved all over the world as a kid, and I wouldn't want to have kids thousands of miles from home). He's always dreamed of living abroad somewhere sunny. He said he needed to take some time to think about it over Christmas, which was scary but ok. I told him to think seriously about it, because I don't want to be his consolation prize if he can't make his dream of living abroad work. I think that made a big impression on him.



Three weeks ago he said he'd made some decisions and suggested we go for drinks to talk. I was really worried that he was going to tell me he couldn't give up the idea of moving abroad and that we were going to break up - I was so nervous. But he said he'd thought about it, and he realised that he wants to be in his current job another two years and then get another job in the same city/country, and by that point if we're still happy together we'll probably want to think about having kids etc. So he said he wanted to suggest we try moving in together, to see if we still get on well, with a view to building a life together.



I was over the moon. Very surprised but so happy. I did say to him that I didn't want him to be with me just because it works out well for his job, and he said that wasn't it at all and that would be horrible.



He has a three month rental (before then he was living with his mum to save money for a house deposit) and I own my own place, so he was going to finish his rental and move in. For the first time I was allowing myself to think about things like weddings, and I was coming up with ways for him to feel like my apartment is his home too.



But on Weds night he came round and dumped me. We were meant to just have a normal night hanging out, I'd got some food and wine and we were going to have dinner and watch TV. He'd seemed totally normal by phone. But he came around and told me that he's been thinking. That although he meant it when he suggested moving in together, he's realised he doesn't want to rule out other options in his life including moving abroad. And he decided that if he felt about me the way he thinks he SHOULD feel about me, he wouldn't want to keep those options open, he'd be happy to just commit to me right now. 



He says he does love me, but he doesn't love me enough. That he feels like he's at 80% and that I deserve someone who is 100%. That he wishes he could flick a switch and make himself feel that way but he can't.



But he also says that I'm by far the best girlfriend he's ever had, that he does love me, that I haven't done anything wrong, that I'm beautiful, that he hasn't cheated and it isn't because he's found himself attracted to anyone else, that I have made him so happy, and that he wants more than anything to have me as a friend. He says it's not that he has some idealised view of what love should be like - he knows it shouldn't be constant fireworks - but that what we have just isn't enough.  



I just don't understand. Can anyone help me understand? I am in shock, physically shaking. I have barely eaten or slept since he told me. I caved this morning and texted him to ask if he can come over after work to talk, because I just don't understand. I'm worried I will be pathetic when I see him. I keep having daydreams where he realises he made a massive mistake and shows up frantic at my door to beg me to take him back.



I also think he is just really confused about what he wants in life generally - he has saved a deposit for a house but keeps going back and forth between buying a place to live in alone, buying a flat abroad for holidays, investing the money in tech stock that locks it up for 3 years, etc. One day he says he wants to move from the UK to California to have kids, the next day he says the education, healthcare and parental leave in the States is awful. He doesn't want a stay-at-home wife, but he wants to move to another country, which makes it very hard for both people to find good jobs in the same city. Is the breakup a symptom of all that? Does it matter?


Any help is so welcome. He's coming over in a few hours.

2 years ago I started going to university, I fell in love with this one girl but stupid as I was I never made myself clear. When I liked the girl we had this party with a bunch of friends where everyone brings small gifts and we roll dices to see who wins which gifts. Out of every single thing imaginable I had brought 2 of the exact same gifts as another girl. I thought nothing of it, as I still liked the other girl, in fact I didn’t even know her name or that we had shared the same classes for months. A couple of months passed and I got over the first girl.


I started hanging out more and more with the similar gift girl pretty much out of the blue. We started texting a lot and drawing elaborate drawings with the draw something app. I’m not much of a guy with female friends so this was new. I could talk with her about absolutely anything and she with me. I never do that with my guy friends and it felt great. It never was love on first sight because I unknowingly had shared classes with her for half a year, but the more we texted and the more we saw each other the more I felt for her. We went on 1 sort of date, although we never labeled it such. I’m traditionally not great with girls so once again I didn’t make my feelings clear but that didn’t matter; what was meant as a funny text she took seriously and she made it very clear we we’re just friends. I took the hint, but I still had hopes silly at it was. When we went out with a group of friends she told everyone she had been dating someone and she kissed a random guy to get over the guy she was dating. I was devastated but I had no one to blame but myself, she made herself clear. 


So far the story is pretty straight forward right?


Then things made a turn for the worse. Normally whenever I’m trying to get over someone I try avoiding them altogether, but I needed my friends very dearly. My father was about to get fired from his job he had been working for over 40 years, 3 years shy of his pension. If that wasn’t bad enough, his cancer treatment had not been successful. Meaning he had to back to chemo for his Hodgkin's lymphoma. My mother had died from cancer 7 years ago, I couldn’t even imagine losing my dad as well. To say the least this was causing a bit of stress. As much as I wanted to let her go, I needed her company as a friend. Things went better for a while, my father could keep his job, the medication had battled the cancer enough that chemo wasn’t necessary for at least half a year. 


Not 2 weeks after the cancer supposedly had weakened,  my father had to the intensive care. After a month of staying there and doing tests they found out he had lung cancer as well as Hodgkin's lymphoma. They gave him less than 6 months. The 6 months turned into 3, and into 1 all within days. When I was called on a Sunday to come by I knew it had to be bad news. It had worsened once more, they gave him 2 weeks and he should prepare his own funeral. Not even 24 hours had passed before he died. 


Needless to say I was devastated. Losing both your parents before you turn 22 doesn’t need any explaining. I will spare the details, also because my memory blocked out many of them. Neither do I want your pity, I shared this because it is important to the story of the girl. My guy friends are great friends, don’t get me wrong, but they don’t talk much. All I wanted to do was talk. That’s where the girl helped me a ton with my grief.


Like I said, my memory isn’t very clear for the 3-4 months after my father’s death but she was always there for me. All the feelings for the girl were gone though. I was consumed by grief, darkness, numbness. I couldn’t feel sadness nor happiness, just a lot of nothing. It took a very long time before is started feeling and remembering things. I still didn’t really have feelings for her either, I was still confused and overwhelmed.


Her life went on though, and she had some dates with a guy. She was constantly asking my advice. What she should ask him and how she blunt could be with it. How much she hated learning to know people on dates, how awkward she always is on them. She told me everything about every date, and how I would have done it if I were her date. She mostly said she was using him as an experiment about how blunt she could be and how sure she was he was gay. 


This was where I was getting confused. She never asked me such questions a year ago, maybe it was because we’ve known each other for a longer time and we were better friends. But then during classes she started resting her head on my shoulder. I wasn’t sure if that’s because she was trying to make the guy she was dating jealous (he was in the same class) or that meant she liked me. But even after she stop dating him she kept doing that. She also had switched some classes so she was in mine. We goofed around, she playfully slapped me when I made fun of her. In general she made me feel like a normal person where as others treated me differently than before my father’s death.  


Out of the blue she told me she was stopping with university. She didn’t like the study and had found a job abroad for 3 months. It took me by surprise, she had mentioned she wasn’t quite sure if this really was her passion but who does know that at the age of 20? We saw each other twice before she left. There always in a sort of tension between us but because she was leaving for quite a while it was more than that.  Some of the things that stood out was that she said she only ever falls in love with people she already knows well. Describing the guy she would fall for (I could find myself in that imagine pretty clearly) and how she would probably never make the first move though. 


It wasn’t after she left I was really starting to get feelings for her again. We still keep in touch by texts and facebook. She came back for 2 days, we saw each other and it was like old times, I felt great and I think she did too. In about a month she’ll be back and I’m considering telling her how I feel. But I’m very bad at reading signs and putting meaning to things that aren’t really there. And since she’s pretty much the only person I can really talk about anything I don’t want to ruin the friendship. So you were in my positions, what would you do? Is she just being a great friend, or does she want something more as well?


**TLDR**; Lost my father, the only girl I can really talk about it might be into me as well, risk the friendship by telling her how I feel?

22701,Dating,2k6jeo,"I was rejected by a girl whom I like after we hung out for the first time last week. Yet, I am still confusing on several questions such 'why she did not like me?' 'How did I turn her off?' 'Should I ask her what happened?' after we have not regularly chat since that night. There must be something she did not like about me. I can't get her off my mind and desperately want her to answer these questions. 


Here are some background stories; I am a 19-year-old Thai boy who is currently studying in a Thai University. I consider myself an introverted person, naturally shy but I do have certain degree of confidence in front of class. I have a very hard time trying to adjust my personality. Though, I like to be alone most of the time but deep inside I desperately want to be comfortable around people. I always want to confidently show off my personality to other people rather than be a quiet, mysterious guy. So, I have never been into any real relationship before. It is killing me how I am such an extreme dependent person. 


I met an above average looking girl [20] in my English class. At first, I did not have any feeling toward her. She is cute but not a kind of girl whom you would turn around and look at her again as she walks by. As the class goes, we proceed to know each other like typical classmates. She is different than others I have met in my campus. She seems to be more engaging to have a conversation with me unlike other people I know who usually would just say 'hi' and ask 'which class are you attending?', say 'bye' and walk off. I rarely see someone tries to break the ice with me. By the time I realized this, I am quite interested in her. Once I know she has not had any boyfriend yet. I began my move. 


I started texting to her and it was going so good. She was very engaging and chatty over texts and so do I. She shares some common interests with me. As a desperate immature kid, I am madly fallen for her. It was obvious to me that I had high chance to close the deal and I highly expect myself and her to be together. She was the one who asked me to hang out with her first, it was her sister's birthday and she wanted me to come. So, I did. There were roughly around 10 people at the gathering. I was sure that I looked good and well-dressed at least that's what I think ( I consider myself a above average looking guy).However, I clearly did not impress her that night. I tried to talk to her but it was just a common conversation (I am not very good at making interesting questions or clever jokes). It began to get awkward when she showed me her home screen photo, it was a picture of a smoking hot dude on our campus that she secretly took and told me that he looks just like Adam Levine and she has a serious crush on him. I tried to take it as a girl's fanboying over celebrities.


She must know that I was so into her as I tried to have a conversation with her. But, She only replied without ask me back (Hey, what about you? etc.)  to keep the conversation flow. Then, it was getting uncomfortable for me because I ran out of anything to talk to her. She did not seemed to be initiative and interested to get to know me like what I thought she is going to be. After the party, I was so loss, disappointed, and confused. She didn't text me like she used to and we have not text or talk for almost a week already. 


I am stuck with these being said questions and thoughts in my head. It drives me nuts. 'How did I turn her off?' 'Am I not attractive for her?' 'Why I was nervous?' Because it is explicit to me that she liked me too, judging from texts (I know texting and talking face-to-face is different but still). She is probably the best person to answer these questions but she would not answer it truthfully, would she? I rejected girls before and I did not answer these same questions when asked because I did not want to coldly say 'I am not attracted to you. Ironically, I am so dying to hear the answers even it could be hurtful. I am thinking about confessing my feeling toward her and ask out of curiosity ‘Why she did not like me?’ Though it seems to be a desperate move, I really need to get it off my chest. But I am not sure if I should do that. 


Reddit please advise me. Should I confront her and ask what happened? How do I move on? Do I still have any chance to win her heart?

22707,Breakups,1tbty0,"I broke up with my girlfriend a little over a week ago at my discretion. We dated for 2 years, and our relationship was filled with drama. After 1.5 years, we broke up for 2 months, then after trying NC and being constantly harassed/stalked by her, we got back together again for another 5 months. I had fond memories of our time together, and I missed her after the 2 months, but after getting back together the same issues arose and I decided it was time to break things off for good last week. I broke up with her because I finally woke up and realized how insecure and unstable she is as a person, and decided I wanted to be with someone who was confident, ambitious, independent, intelligent, and someone who felt like my equal, not like a child I had to look after. 

She had bought christmas gifts for me before I had told her I wanted to break up. Neither one of us has family in the area and we will both be alone on christmas day. She wants to get together on christmas day and give me gifts and spend the day with me. She has justified by stating that she doesn't want to be alone, she understands we are broken up but still cares for me and wants to give me the gifts even so, and she wants one final day together to give her some closure. She's a very insecure and needy person, so I feel like this is either an attempt on her part to keep me roped in to some degree, or get another 'hit' like an addict on love.

I feel kind of uncomfortable with the situation. I don't really want to take her gifts or get her gifts because I feel like its a waste of money when we are over. I also don't want to give her the impression that I still care, because I think she will take it as a sign that I still have some feelings for her and she will have hope that we will get back together. I also know she will try and seduce me. Even though I still have feelings for her and care for her, I do not want to have contact with her because my mental association with her is one of pain right now, and not happiness. I do not look back on our relationship fondly. Although it had good times, I view it overall as a 'what the fuck was I doing with this person?'. How could I have wasted so much time on someone who was so awful/incompatible for me?

I want to move on. I feel like seeing her on christmas would set us both back in moving on. It's only going to hurt her further, and make it harder for me to forget her. But she's being really insistent on it the few times we have had contact to coordinate the dividing of shared things and getting items back from each other. Part of me says 'fuck it, its just one more day then you can be done with this.', but the other part says 'stick your guns dude, be done with it now. you've been feeling better every day, this is only gonna set you back to getting back on your feet and finding someone else you really want to be with. Plus, you are totally repulsed by her now, would you even want to spend the day with her?'.

Short summary of current situation:
I called my ex two weeks ago &amp; she told me she fell in love with someone back home. They were close friends from years ago when they worked together &amp; reconnected this summer. She said the thought of hurting my like this was killing her, but she'd rather do this now instead of stringing me along all summer. I'm thankful for how she handled it &amp; while I don't hold any ill-feelings towards her or him, I've (with great difficulty) succeeded in not contacting her at all since. I feel the best way to handle this is to just give her space. If they work out, I'm happy for her. But if they don't, I don't want to push her away now by trying to win her back or anything like that. I know our distance situation won't change until school starts back, so there's no point of me trying to.

All that being said, the reason I called her was to surprise her with tickets to her favorite artist in the world. She never went to a concert before meeting me &amp; loved it. So for a surprise summer plan, last month I bought us tickets to go to that show. Thankfully, she ended it before I had the chance to tell her that... I don't know whether she would have been quite so eager to not string me along in that case.

I'm now struggling with whether I should tell her about the show at all. I don't plan on ever telling her I had tickets or had even planned on going. But I know she doesn't keep tabs on any of the concert scene &amp; would be crushed if she found out he was playing only a couple hours away after the fact. I just don't know how/if I should go about telling her about the show. I don't want to sound like I'm trying to convince her to go with me, or even hint at the fact I had planned on taking her.

I still care about her &amp; want her to be happy. Even if it's with someone else, I'd want her to go. And to address the question now, yes, I've already sold the tickets. I don't have any sort of fantasy of running into her there, or changing her mind into coming with me.

22718,Breakups,2naf28,"My boyfriend of 1.5 years broke up with me about 3 weeks ago, and I feel completely blindsided. I moved to a different state for a yearlong job about 4 hours away from him in August. We were committed to making it work, and aside from my general feelings of loneliness of being in a city where I didn't know anyone, we were in a good place. About a week before the break up he mentions he's been talking to a guy we had both met a week prior. Then a couple of days after that he told me he was just going to grab drinks and dinner with him. I immediately felt like something was wrong because I had experienced a similar situation in the past with an ex. We got into a bit of a tiff, but he constantly reassured me that nothing was going on and nothing was going to happen and that he loved me and couldn't wait for me to visit that weekend. That night he wouldn't return any of my texts/calls, and I learned from the Facebook location feature that he had spent the night at the guy's apartment. He didn't leave the next day until noon, at which point I called and he seemed completely callous, like it was no big deal. He ignores me for a few more days, and then calls to tell me that I haven't been happy (even though I was very happy with us, just stressed about living somewhere new) and that he thought he was strong enough to make this work but couldn't do it anymore. I went complete NC and inadvertently learned that the same day he ended it with me, he shacked up with that guy. And from my weak moments of looking at various social media, I've learned they are still together.

I am just so confused and blindsided by all of this. Just a few days prior to all of this we were talking about plans for when I was going to move back up there to be with him. We had so many conversations about whether this was what we both wanted, and I thought we were completely on the same page. Now all it took was one night out with a guy he just met and I'm completely replaced like that. I just feel so alone and so betrayed and so devastated. He embodied so many of the qualities that I look for in a mate that I had never been able to find in someone else, and I'm so terrified that I'll never click with someone like that ever again. I can't stop dwelling on it or thinking about him with this other guy, no matter how hard I try to distract myself. And it's always worse in the morning. I just feel so gutted and confused.

I went complete NC after our final conversation in which we broke up. I didn't beg, I didn't plead. I just let it happen, and I haven't spoken to him since. I'm just so baffled at how someone can go from telling me how much he loves me, how he wants to move in together and start a family, to immediately (and I mean immediately) jumping into something with a guy he just met (who, coincidentally, was also in a long-term relationship at the time).

I know time and NC will help heal the wounds. I just need to vent and get it out.  I keep dwelling on it and thinking of him and the two of them together and how I am in this black hole while he continues to live his life.

22723,Breakups,1kopcn,"So, a little bit of background: we started dating six years ago, just before we started med school (same year, same class). It was the first relationship for both of us, and even though it had its ups and downs, it went quite well, I think. After some time we finally managed to get the gist of each other and things started going pretty well. We didn't go out together a lot (each had his/her own group of friends, sometimes shared and sometimes not), but we kept seeing each other nearly every day (in class, dates, etc.). We also decided to go on Erasmus (university exchange for one year) together to Berlin, and the drill was the same (living apart, different groups of friends, sometimes going out together and sometimes not, etc.).


The first thing that went awry was two years ago, when just before moving to Berlin and after she failed an exam she broke up with me as she had been thinking about the future, didn't think this would go on forever and thus was quite stressed about the exams and could not study, these thoughts staying in her head and not being able to bring them out, profoundly disturbing her. So we stopped seeing each other, my reaction was, as expected by me, quite harsh (not talking to her at all but in very distant, unfriendly tones, as I didn't take the breakup with the best of spirits). After one week she told me that she thought had made a mistake, and wanted to get back together, which we did. Since then there were no major fights, and imho the relationship progressed quite well.


Fast forward to this summer. We finished medschool in March, and since July (I was in Japan for month and a half before, on my own) we have been preparing our national doctor's exam, which is due in February (and after which we have to choose a spot in a hospital anywhere in the country; we hadn't really talked about going to the same city but in any case we would be moving out of were we currently are, be it the same or different cities).


At that point we both felt that we had never been as good in our relationship as this time (quote from her), as we both were in a physically better shape, and could combine pretty well studying with seeing each other. End August, one day I go visit her and she tells me, quite disturbed, that for a week or so she has been thinking about the future, and that after doing the exam we should depart ways and stop being together, as she wants to start a new life in a new city and be able to meet new people without the limits of telling them &lt;hey, I've got a boyfriend&gt;. I told her that I was not up for a relationship that has an expiration date, and that if she is sure that we are going to break up in six months, I'd rather do it now and stop investing in that relationship. We agree to give us two weeks to think about it and reach a final decision, and after three days she calls me to tell me that she wants to keep with this until it lasts. We are both happy, everything's OK.


Then, last Friday (one week later) she tells me she needs to talk. Somehow I expect what she's gonna tell me, as she had been acting weird the last two days, and then when I get to her she mentions that:

A) she knows she had told me the other day that she wanted to keep on, but after some days she realized she really didn't

B) she loved our relationship but I wasn't in any of the ideas she had of her future's, and wanted to start a new life in a new city

C) she had fallen for another guy from her gym that had invited her to dinner some weeks ago. She had rejected the offer because she had a boyfriend, but was regretting doing so. I knew she was talking with this guy for some time, but not that (1) it had been for some months and (2) that she had an active interest on him.

D) she couldn't concentrate on the studies because of these thoughts and had wasted the last two weeks just wondering about this, and she wanted to leave me also to be able to study


For me it was the biggest betrayal I ever suffered. Not only did (and do) I love her, but I also had those longings for freedom outside the relationship, although assessing the situation I felt that I was waaaay better off with her than in a fictional 'state of freedom'. I spoke her some harsh words regarding how I felt betrayed and really sad and left, and how any I'm sorry on her part would not help at all. She also wouldn't tell me why she hasn't spoken to me about these issues before, so that we could have (tried) fixing them. We haven't spoken since, a reaction she expected (she told me she would give me some space). I guess she will be crying over in her bedroom for a day or two, but will keep on with her life no probs.


A friend of her (also friend of mine) told me she (my ex) was thinking that we were too young when we started dating (18 and 16) and that she longed for enjoying the world and do silly things for some time. It helped gain some insight, but didn't help in any other thing.


I'm pretty destroyed right now. A world I somehow had for granted vanished before I could do anything, and in a couple weeks we went from being having the best time ever to this. Right now I don't wanna see her face ever again, nor talk to her , but I also know this is pretty destructive and it's gonna drive me mad. I'm only 'forced' to see her on Saturdays, during our exam preparation classes, and I guess I will be in a non-speaking-to-her policy. However, I'm not sure which are my feelings toward her right now, and what would I do if she backed out (which I doubt) or any other situation. I have a deep love-deep hate feeling towards her right now.


Also, I'm away in another country with my family until Thursday, which may or may not help disconnecting. 
To clear this up, after we finish our exam (April) I can just choose a big city as working place and never ever see her again.


Anyway, I need help/advice dealing with this. My friends have been really really helpful listening to me and my sob stories and giving support, but nevertheless I'd very much appreciate your insight. 
Thanks in advance. If you read until here, extra thanks :)

**TL;DR**: girlfriend of six years broke up because she wanted a new life after we finished university and didn't see any future with me although she was pretty satisfied with the relationship. Another guy may or may not be involved.

I have been in an on-again off-again relationship with a fuck buddy - titles change so often there's no reason trying to title us as boyfriend-girlfriend at this point. I invite him to live with me periodically, to nutshell, but he is currently living with me. Let's call him George [32 M]

In the past when we lived together, we did label ourselves as in a relationship but during this time I also discovered that he was cheating on me and had been for some time. I confronted the girl he was cheating on me with and discovered he never told her the truth - she was under the impression I was just his ex-gf roommate. 

Instead of dumping him, I put him on a shorter leash, told him he'd have to cut ties with her, stop cheating and just be with me monogamously if he wanted us to work out. He became more and more distant. By January, I had stopped caring and was looking around for someone to cheat on him with. 

I know what you're thinking - why didn't I just end it? Perhaps I should have, but I feel bad, I do care about him and I know without me, he wouldn't have anyone to turn to and nowhere to live. 

I met someone on Craigslist, another part of the triangle. [28 M who we'll call James] who had a similar situation. Lived with his significant other, but was lonely and was looking to connect with someone else on a sex/friendship level. It seemed perfect. We hit it off almost instantly and began talking about anything and everything under the sun. I feel like I can really be myself around him, and better yet, we can truly be honest with each other and that feels so freeing. 

He warns me not to fall for him, that he's really not looking to leave his girlfriend, that he's a serial cheater and he was really just looking to make a new friend to talk to. Why didn't I end things? Again, how often in life do you really have chemistry with someone? It's rare for me personally...

After a couple of weeks of this fucking/talking/connecting whirlwind, we both impulsively decide that we want to be together for real, admit that we're in love with each other, and want to leave our significant others. To again nutshell, things didn't go exactly as planned - the other part of this equation, James' significant other, felt something was off and noticed some things around the apartment out of place. She confronted James and he told her he'd been cheating on her and she told him to leave. 

Later that day, he moves in. I have a very awkward conversation with George where I tell him I've been seeing someone else, and that oh, well, he needs to leave because new boyfriend is moving in. Let's say he didn't take it well, he yelled, cried and after hours of explaining the situation to him over and over, he left. 

I felt like shit. But also happy. We have a wonderful couple of weeks together --until James' ex tells him she wants him back and the whole thing was a big mess given that his mom is in love with his ex, that she's a more comfortable and convenient option for him and that he never stopped loving her. As soon as it began, it ended. 

We stopped talking for awhile. I wanted to cut all ties with him. I've never felt that kind of heartbreak that felt so much like grieving death, the pain was excruciating. I begged George to come back and he came back so quickly I had to ask why he wanted to be with someone who just left him and treated him like shit, to which there was no response. 

After about a month of no contact, James messaged me - he said he missed me, that he feels he's made a mistake, that he doesn't want me to cut him out of my life and he asks me to come over. We have sex, I cry, he cries, I realize coming over was stupid and I'm afraid I'm going to get hurt again. 

I did again cut off contact, and at that point, we tried to just be friends, but a friend of James' basically said he didn't understand why we weren't together since it was obvious we were good for each other. Well, one thing led to another, and we ended up doing it again. 

Over time, while James and I do occasionally still fuck/make out/cheat on our significant others, we are friends first and foremost. After much debate and conversation, we've realized though that we truly can't get away from each other and we both struggle with the idea that we should just realize that we should be together. 

The problem of course really lies with this square of deceit. I've lied to George mostly about James being back in my life. James has not said a word to his now again GF about me or cheating. George has been getting increasingly angry about the time I spend away from the apartment and after an hour of interrogation last week, I told him the truth. He hasn't left, but he is basically saying once the month is over, he's going to go find some other girl/situation unless I stop talking to James altogether. 

I can't blame him. He's brought up as of the last few days that he has James' GF's contact information and he feels she has a right to know. 

James over the last few weeks has basically said he loves us both equally, it's hard for him to choose, and that there are ultimately three paths: 

Given the amount of risks and time we spend together, GF finds out on her own that he's still seeing me.

I tell GF myself. 

OR 

We continue to hang out just like we are now, we're not together and GF gets left in the dark. 

James does justify this with What GF knows won't hurt her, of course.... but I don't understand the need to live such a huge lie. At the same time, that makes me a hypocrite. 

I know I'll be harshly judged and I know James will as well, but I'm curious to see what kind of comments this spurs. Sorry for all the anonymity, but you know. There's secrets involved here. What would you do if you were in this situation? I would appreciate the refraining from the I just wouldn't be in the situation because I will say I do think it's possible to be in love with two people. The problem are the lies and secrets to maintain this fucked up square situation. 




**tl;dr**: I live with an on-again-off again significant other but I'm in love with someone else who also lives with a significant other who is in love with both of us.

My ex girlfriend and I are seniors in high school about to graduate. We started texting each other in August of last summer and didn't begin dating until December. We progressed far enough into the relationship that we began to have sex but a few major reasons ruined our relationship. I broke up with her at the end of March but over the past two weeks (starting 6 weeks after the breakup), we both decided that since we still have feelings for each other and since the problems we had before are things which could be solved, that we should work on retrying the relationship.


We haven't told any of our friends or our parents yet in fear of these mutual feelings being superficial or that the problems couldn't be worked out. We agreed that in order to confirm this is the right decision, we should spend some time together. In order to do this without bringing our parents into the equation just yet, we both lied about where we were going last Friday, when in reality we hung out. We just drove and talked for a while, and it ended with us parking in a secluded location and hooking up. Over the past few days, we returned pretty much 100% to our old ways; saying we love each other again, talking about plans to stay together through college, how we are going to make this relationship last this time, etc.


Last night, when she went to take a shower, her mom took her phone and read every single text message between the two of us for the past week. Apparently her mom had been sensing something wrong with the way she had been acting lately, and wasn't sure if she had been telling the truth with where she said she had been going. There were very descriptive and raunchy conversations about what we did when we hung out on Friday and what we wanted to do to each other in the future. There were very intimate messages professing our love to each other and how much we care about each other, plans for each other to sleep at the others house while their parents are away, and so many other things that no one besides the two of us should ever read, especially her mom.


Keep in mind that her mom had no prior knowledge of us having sex while we dated. Her mom was in tears while she interrogated my ex about everything she had read. Her mom told her she was disgusted by what she had read and that she knows my ex has more self respect than that. She asked my ex if we ever had sex and my ex told her we hadn't. She is considering not letting my ex go on our senior vacation after we graduate. She made my ex explain everything we had done together and is still deciding whether she's telling my ex's dad or not. She's also taking my ex to the doctor to get her checked if she's ever had sex before and apparently checked for other things since she was unaware she was sexually active. Her mom isn't mad at her but she's extremely disappointed and obviously lost a whole bunch of trust in my ex. After weeks of both of us being unsure whether we still wanted each other and then finally deciding we wanted to date again, we're not getting back together. Even if her mom miraculously changes her mind, there's no way I'd ever look her in the eyes after the things she read.


Yes, I'm embarrassed because her mom knows the things I've said to her and yes, I'm crushed that things are over between us, but that might not even be the worst part. It's almost as if she has been brainwashed by her mom into thinking the things she has said and done to me are inappropriate and lying to her mom was a horrible mistake. I'm not condoning lying to parents but this was only a small lie to prevent a whole lot of explaining. There's thousands of worse things she could have been doing instead of hanging out with me for a couple hours. Also, I don't think it's fair for her mom to say she has more self respect than this because this is perfectly normal things for teenagers to say to their love interest. It's not as if her daughter is doing and saying these things with a random boy she barely knows and it's not like her mom hated me before this either. She knows I'm a very smart and nice kid and she's heard nothing but great things about me from other people.


TL;DR; My ex and I returned to our old ways of saying we love each other and discussing very descriptive sexual acts.

Also she told me she had an episode of insomnia for 3 years and when she went to a psychologist to see what was the problem, the psych told her she had violent tendencies and was sociopathic.

22739,Breakups,3azy3l,"We were together for almost three years, two of which she has been away at school for. Before she went to school we were in a very passionate connected relationship, but I was recovering from a whole life of anxiety and was just coming out into the world, and I was encouraging her to follow her dreams too. Her first year at school we would talk all the time and fall asleep together on facetime.

Her second year she was very busy taking a couple studio classes, and being an officer for one. I would always be falling asleep by the time she would get home so our communication suffered greatly. Whenever she would come home to visit she would melt right away into my arms and tell me how much she missed me, and how good it was to finally relax. I was always anxious to keep busy and make the most of our time together. I never really realized that two years had already gone by, I was always looking from break to break. She had kept moving ahead in life, and I still hadn't made any steps to move up to be with her.

She broke up with me two months ago after a serious of anxious episodes on my part. I would get really nervous about her walking home at night, and when it would get to be one in the morning I would send her a torrent of worried text messages, and complain that she couldn't take a moment just to let me know she was going to be so late. She told me we should break up because she was going to be even busier this coming year with her classes, being president of a club, officer for the lab, and a job. Also to save money she moved in with her friend and a one year lease.

I was confident that she loved me, I was nothing when we got together and had been moving forward, but lost my way somewhere. Since the break up I've managed to get a job, my license, and make several new friends, and regain several old ones. I feel like I've grown so much through this breakup, but she says that she has made up her mind. Whenever the topic of us would come up she would say, it's too hard to be in a relationship with me right now. She can't be that with me, right now. But she never said that this was a permanent situation, it seemed like it would be fixable.

She came to get her things the other day, but left behind her stuffed animal that I sleep with, and a ring her grandma gave her that she said I could use if we never had the extra money. When she was here we got along well and laughed and smiled and touched a few times, she even said we could hang out again. But when I talked to her last night she said that she forgot the ring and wanted it back. So that makes it official.

I really love her, and want her to be happy, but it feels like this is a situation that I let evolve until she finally had to make the change. Still I hope that she still loves me in some way and that we could form a real plan to start a new. I have finally found myself and it's too late. I really want the best for her and I know that we still care for eachother. If only we can continue to grow and make it through this year.

22741,Breakups,2aqbv8,"i'd like to preface this post with an honestly, i think if i really wanted to make things work, we could make things work.

my SO is a great guy. patient, smart, caring, funny, attractive. we communicate well together. never yell. always reasonable, even when upset.

while we don't have that much in common in terms of interests, we have enough shared history at this point that we always have something to talk about (albeit not necessarily the most engaging conversations).

but, because of the way our relationship has played out (i think he got complacent and didn't really listen to what i was telling him i needed out of our relationship, so we've just been coasting for the past 2 years. he assumed i could wait until we were married for every aspect of our relationship to fall into place.), and how little common ground we have to start from, my well is dry... i haven't really felt any real romantic love for a long time now, and though i think i could rekindle it, i just don't want to try anymore. if we were married, i'm certain we could work it out. but, we're not married, so i guess, i'm not really obligated to try any more than i've already tried.

we almost broke up a couple of weeks ago. but i wasn't psychologically prepared to just end it, just like that. we seem to have such a good thing (lack of romantic love on my part aside), it just seems like such a colossal waste to throw it all away...

i know he loves me so much. when we almost broke up, he realized how complacent he had been. for the past two weeks, i can tell he's been trying more. but it feels awkward now and just way, way too late... i notice and appreciate it, but i guess my heart just doesn't want it anymore.

realistically, we could probably go on like this forever, and i'd be okay with it, i guess, and he'd be very happy.

but although i could go on like this forever, i don't think that is what i really want for myself.

so now i feel i have to bite the bullet here and just end it.

a part of me knows that after we break up, i'll probably regret it. but another part of me thinks that's just a risk i have to take.

so my question is, how do i break up with someone who loves me so much, when there are no hard feelings, when we've been together so long, when i know he's spent the past few years saving up for a wedding?

So about a few weeks ago, my girlfriend of over two years dropped a bombshell on me and broke up. Her reasoning she told me was that we were moving too fast and that she felt that she wasn't into the relationship anymore. She felt that we weren't being being friends anymore. We lived together for about a year and everything seemed to be fine. No fighting, barely any arguments and she seemed happy.

I personally took it pretty hard because I have never had anyone break up with me. This was the longest relationship I have ever had and just feel pretty crappy right now. I moved over 500 miles away from my family for school (I met my ex 2 years ago at school) and now I feel so alone out here. I have a few friends out here, but it's still tough. 

We really haven't spoken to each other that much because she wants to be friends and I'm not comfortable with that right now. We talked a little bit a few days ago and she still wants to be friends.

22752,Dating,2nyhlk,"For one reason or another, I’ve only had one situation in which I had to tell a first date, someone I barely knew, that I was a stripper. I wasn’t prepared for it and it didn’t go down how I would have liked, but luckily it wasn’t an issue.

However, I’m dating again now and I’d like to have a better plan for when the question of what I do for a living comes up. I’m doing online dating so I imagine it might happen often. 

On one hand, a first date isn’t necessarily someone I want to see again. If I can avoid telling them what I do, that’s one less stranger who knows I’m a stripper as well as who I am ‘in the real world.’ Also, I usually get a string of predictable and kinda nosy questions when people find out what I do and I’d like to minimize how often I have to go through that especially if it’s with someone I might not invest in. 

On the other hand, honesty is an important part of my image of myself and I make a conscious effort to tell the truth even when it doesn’t end up great for me. If I do end up wanting to see someone again, I will soon have to tell them that one of their first impressions of me was a lie. I worry this will make them wonder, understandably, what else I might have lied about and if I will lie to them in the future. Also, I’m not a great liar. In the past, my plan to keep my job a secret has played out like this, with someone I play sports with:

Him: So what do you do?       
Me: I’m a cocktail waitress, how about you?          
Him: Engineer. Where do you work?        
Me: One of the bars in the downtown district.       
Him: Oh I go there a lot. Which one?       
Me: Um…uh…okay you caught me, I’m not a waitress, I’m a stripper.       

I could tell people I have no job, I guess. I am going to university full time. But I don’t want them to think money is a problem for me, or get the impression that I’m someone who doesn’t have to support themselves. 

It’s a weird balance because I like my job and I’m not embarrassed about it I just don’t necessarily want it spread around. My family and many of my acquaintance-ish friends don’t know. I also don’t want people to assume I have the same habits or lifestyles stereotypically attributed to strippers.

Tl;dr: I'm a stripper and am conflicted about whether or not to tell people this on the first date. 

What would you do if you had a job you wanted to keep in the bag for a while? Would you be upset to date a girl for a couple weeks, then learn she’d kept this from you?

22753,Dating,2bj5vx,"I'll try to keep this as short as possible, but I could really use some help on this issue.  

I've had this friend for about 2 years (let's call him Mike).  Met in school, kept in touch post graduation.  Throughout the summer, we saw each other quite a bit and I started developing feelings for him, and at some point I thought he felt the same way.

However, Mike confessed to me a lot of his 'dark past'.  He's had a very rough life, witnessing more than 1 death and being forced out of his home and constantly being in accidents (ie: being caught in fires, witnessing explosions, nearly getting mugged).  He takes a lot of medication for all this trauma, but (much to my heartbreak) he constantly speaks about his ex-girlfriend.

The ex-girlfriend (we'll call her Jamie, 19 yrs old) plays a major role in Mike's life.  For three years they dated rather happily, and for the first time in Mike's life, he had peace of mind.  Then, about a year ago, Jamie broke up with him while he was out of state, calling him and telling him that it was over.  

I'm actually not too clear on what happened between them; I figured that it was none of my business.  All I know is that she apparently hates him, and refuses to reply to any of his messages.

Mike tells me that he's thought about her every day since then.  He's still hopelessly in love, and I've tried to encourage him to contact her, to move on, to do anything that would give him closure.

A few days ago, he asked me to text a number, saying Hey it's Alexa to see if someone replies.  Logically, I knew it would be Jamie's old number, but I figured that she would have changed it by now and texted the number to obey him.  

To my surprise, she texted back an hour later.  Hey!! CONGRATULATIONS ON GETTING ENGAGED!  What's up? :)  I was at a loss for words, but I told Mike that the number worked.

He then asked me to continue to text her.  Thank you!  How have you and Mike been?  

I had absolutely no intention of carrying a conversation with Jamie, especially pretending to be someone else.  I've never met her, and her story with Mike is a bit of an enigma, but I knew that this wasn't the way to get in touch with her again.  I told him that I wouldn't text her, that this wasn't the way to handle it, and he started to freak out.  

Receiving one message from her would have made me happier than anything in the world.
She talked to you and you have forsaken my request.  She's the reason for my unrelenting sadness and heart break.
Don't test my patience.
You take me too lightly.

I told him I wouldn't talk with him unless he comes to his senses, and I haven't spoken to him since.  Nor have I replied to Jamie.

I feel like I'm doing the right thing by not lying to Jamie.  I feel like if she wanted to talk to Mike at all, she wouldn't want to be lied to by some girl she doesn't know.  
However, I'm still worried for Mike.  Not texting her may be the thing that drives him over the edge and makes him go do something he'll regret.  In a lesser worrisome scenario, I'm worried that I'll lose him as a friend.

Am I doing the right thing?  Or am I doing this out of jealousy, compassion, or am I hoping to make this work for me?  I'm at a loss, and I could really use some advice.

*edit*  Followed everyone's advice, and for the past few weeks I haven't heard too much from him; occasional texts about twice a week, but nothing more.  I'm pleased to admit that I'm no longer attracted to him in any way, and we'll likely drift apart very soon.  I sincerely wish him the best with his life, but it's not my problem.  

Thank you all again so much for your support!

You should know that we have the same group of friends and they set us up.

Long story short, we went on a couple of dates and she made the first move on me. I took her out the dinner a couple of days later and told her that I wasn't ready for anything serious (she knew I had just gotten out of a long term relationship and was only half way healed from it) and that I was enjoying the dates. She told me that she was going to date other people to which I told her that is great. I mentioned that I would never get in the way of her happiness and that I wanted her to date others. I paid for our meals, drove her home, and we talked some more. She did not try to make a move, but I gave a hug to show that I still liked her.

A week passed at this point with less text messages from her and that's when I believe I made a bone headed move. I was getting out of class on Friday and I asked her if she wanted to go to dinner. She said maybe depending on what was going on that weekend. So I sent her a text 5 hours later asking her if she still wanted to join me. She fired back with a bitchy response, which wasn't like her. So I let it go.

I give it a week or two and call her up. I apologized to her if I had misled her or hurt her feelings. She said it was fine because she knew I wasn't ready for a serious relationship. That's when she hit me with this little gem....

I realized in the end that I was not really interested in you.

I couldn't help but to chuckle. OOPS. I told her respectfully that I was okay with this and wanted to still be friends. She was fine with that and that's when she had to go.

I assume I hurt her feelings and now shes trying to save face by telling me she wasn't interested. Did I also screw up and doing something bad because I went on dates knowing full well that I didn't want anything serious? Since my breakup with my fiance, I have become TERRIBLE at social situations.

Saturday morning my Girlfriend and I broke up, Sunday I started moving back to my parents. My old room became storage when I moved out so currently I'm crammed on a kids bed in a room surrounded by boxes, furniture, all sorts of crap. It sucks, luckily a mate offered to come round tonight and help me clear the room, there's no where to put all this stuff however and i've got a house full of things to move in - this seems like the straw that could break the camels back.

While I was packing a few things my girlfriend was crying and hugging me the whole time, saying she loved me please don't hate her, begging to still be friends (never asked me to stay), when I actually went to walk out the door she said she wanted to talk about things when I came back for the rest of my belongings and saying she thinks one day she might regret this (she spoke about feeling trapped/not working a few weeks a go, but I was the one who actually picked up and left as after talking for a few days I felt like we had hit a brick wall, this hurt me terribly as 6 months ago I was ready to marry this girl)

Right now I'm still hurting, I don't know 100% which way I want to go. But I do know that I'll see her both days this weekend as I need to get my belongings out and it's gonna kill, I'm worried i'll break and become super beta.

22763,Breakups,2qw0cw,"I met up with my ex to exchange stuff and talk about her wish to possibly get back together. It's been about 6 weeks since we broke up. We broke up for various reasons: I had become defensive and she had been threatening break up a lot since we went long distance, I was starting to feel like I was walking on eggshells and she had been verbally abusive to me when drunk.

It was all going very amicably until we went for a meal after some drinks. I was even thinking it could be a good idea to get back together. Since our break up she has had a very tough time with a bereavement in the family and she cried a bit about it and we hugged and kissed. 

At the meal, she started to get drunk and angry about her boss emailing her. Then she said I had been selfish and wasn't there for her through the bereavement because we ended up talking about our relationship. This is true and I do regret this. Even though we were broken up I wanted to try and help but I was selfish and let my own feelings get in the way and had a go at her for her actions while she was grieving which is awful. But since then I had done all I could to help her. 

Then she started telling me that she had been sent screenshots of messages in which my friends were bad-mouthing her. This is when it started to get really weird. She told me loads of different stories of where this information had come from - at first it was screenshots of messages, then it was a group conversation, then it was a 'hacking bot' sending her emails with screenshots, then it was that my friend's boyfriend had told his gay friends that she was exaggerating her family problems to try and get me to get back with her. I don't think any of my friends would say stuff like this and the story switched so much, it just didn't make sense.

She started mumbling something and I heard the words 'selfish c\*nt'. I asked her Did you just call me a selfish c\*nt? and she said she hadn't but other people were and she had defended me. Then she started getting angry that I didn't believe her stories and started pounding the table (all this in a crowded restaurant) and saying Fuck you. I said I felt unsafe and threw some money on the table and left.

When I left she called me lots of times and then she messaged me saying I'll just go out with her then. Turns out she has a new girl lined up already who has been waiting to see if we'll get back together. New girl said I would probably be too stuck in the past to get back together with her. I guess being stuck in the past is not a bad thing as my ex cannot seem to stop herself from being drunk and abusive even for one day when she is supposedly on her best behaviour trying to win me back. 

I blocked her on everything but the whole episode has totally shaken me. Because she had the death in her family right after our break up I feel like I am in the wrong, even though I couldn't have predicted what would happen. I'm also really nervous she will badmouth me to people or do something to hurt me or sabotage me because she was acting so erratically.

22764,Breakups,2dwlrj,"Hi, reddit!

Ok, that's my stupid story. 
I am originally from Russia where I have met this girl almost 5 years ago. 
I truly loved her all this time, took care of her, felt her pain, as it was my own pain. Honestly, I thought it true love of my life. 
We discussed marriage before, of course, probably 3 years ago. My opinion is that family should be independent, in financial meaning also.  So, I told her that I will make a proposal after all our studies when I will be able to find a proper job.
Two years ago we moved together to Czech Republic, studied for one more, last year. 
.And so I did it, proposal, year ago, on the beach in Spain. She definetely said yes. We both found job in Prague, started building our own hearth. 
Unfortunately, I was completely blind. For almost 7 last months we was cheating on me - I think there was no sex, but a lot of kisses, saying I love you to another guys and etc.
I always trusted her, I think that trust and respect should lay in the fundament of family. So, I always let her go on parties and corporate evenings. My mistake...


Time before wedding was really busy, a lot of stuff to do and to organize, we did not have time to think it through. Three weeks before date she came home after party truly wasted, we tried to have sex, but in the middle of process she started to cry. I just said fuck it, go sleep and tried to forget about this. 
On the wedding she was beatufil. I mean it - she was the most beatufil woman I have ever seen! We were happy, as I thought. 


However, after two weeks, she came home again absolutely drunk. In  one week things went wrong - we were alien to each other, did not talk. I was expecting some apologies, but did not received any. 
After several fights, she finally told me - I have another guy. 
To say that I was surprised is to say nothing. I could not believed this!
On the next day she told that she wants to be my wife and only mine. 
I said ok, let's handle it somehow. Of course, it did not work out. Several days of two completely strangers in one room. 


I bought two tickets to Greece, just to be alone, to remind ourselves our feelings. Nope, another mistake. In Greece, she told let me go, I am happy only with him... I was destroyed, I am destroyed. 
I moved out, did not see for several months, did not speak with her. 
I applied for divorce, I cannot forgive this betrayal, this unfaithfulness...


My problem is that I still love her. And hate her. Half of my soul cannot live without her, another half wants to kill her. Everyday is just struggle, I am just nothing, shade of myself. Drink whiskey every night. 


I cannot let her go, cannot free my mind, cannot move further. I wanted family with her, I was planning children, buying house, moving to another country together. She was my life for 5 years, I put all my emotions, efforts, money into her. 
The only thing I received back - betrayal, she just used me. Took everything she could and threw me away. 
I feel used, absolutely worthless. 
Have no idea what to do. I am afraid to speak with her because, maybe, I will not find enough power to control myself, I really can just beat her to death...

I am full of hatred and despair. 
How to move on? How to forget it? How to forgive her? And should I forgive her? I cannot live that way to long, just do not have enough power for that...


TL:DR. We have together almost five years, year ago I made proposal. 
She cheated on me three weeks before wedding and two weeks after. Now we are in divorce procedure. Half of me still loves her, another half wants to kill her and myself.

I am in a long distance relationship with my boyfriend. We met online and things in the beginning were wonderful. 6 months into the relationship, he started becoming very angry. Snapping at me, yelling at me during conversations online etc. Then he became all nice and sweet, and apologized and saying I was the best thing under the stars.


We continued the relationship. Over the past 6 years we have visited each other about 8 times. About two years ago, I attempted to break things up with him. I felt like I was in a vicious cycle. Him abusing me by calling me names, putting me down, making fun of my sexual abuse as a child. Each time it was the same, he asked for forgiveness, and I came back like a little puppy.


All I knew and understood was bad relationships (horrible relationship with father, sexually abused by grandmother, not wanted by mother.) I thought this was normal.


I loved my boyfriend. He has only been abusive towards me because i DESERVED IT (that is what I thought.) I thought we were soulmates, and I told him I can't wait to live with him! 


The abuse was more and more and more often. I couldn't take it anymore. I broke up with him. He started to threathen me. Saying things like he will hurt me, he will hurt my family, break my family's knees in, send my naked photographs everywhere online, send it to my family, to my pastor, to my workplace, get me fired. etc.


And I would beg him for forgiveness. And he would accept me back, and forgive me. This would happen, over and over again. He charmed me again, sending me flowers. I promised my undying love to him.


Then he started showing his horns. He wouldn't let me have my own opinion. He would never be proud of me. I once won an award and he made fun of me. I told him it's over, I can't stay with him anymore. And then it started again, him being abusive, putting me down, saying how I deserved to be molested. 


And again, I begged for forgiveness. He forgave me, charmed me, I told him I loved him forever and can't stand being without me.


Reddit, you get the gist. This has been happening for the past two years. It's not empty threats either. He once uploaded my naked photo online.


I want to break up with him. I don't know how. I tried emailing his police force (he lives in the UK.) The first time, they just blew it off, the second time, they ignored me completely. Like I don't matter because I'm some idiot girl in a rural place in NY.

We have an afternoon date this weekend and I think then would be a good time to ask, but what is the most casual/non-confrontational way to ask? I know how I ask won't change anything, but I'm worried about coming on too strong/serious.  Particularly if he says no! 

On a side note, it's strange that it's (only) an afternoon date, and I'd assume he were dumping me if he didn't seem so enthusiastic.   Usually our plans go beyond an afternoon. So I also have a slight fear of mentioning exclusivity right before he ends things!  

Some potential ways I've been thinking about asking are asking if he's seeing anyone else, mention it in the context of sexual safety, ask him how he feels about me, ask him about exclusivity without my own feelings, or mentioning my own feelings without asking about exclusivity... I have too many scenarios going through my head!

So I ended up breaking up with her (lets call her Jessica) just a few weeks ago. We had a discussion during the summer about how I needed both of us to make sure that we knew for sure if the relationship was right. Me being the first person she has dated, and her being the first person I have dated, it is impossible to know if we are right for each other. I needed the opportunity to find out for myself, and to get to know more people. The relationship just didn't feel the same anymore, and I felt like I was leading her on, which is the worst thing to do. 

Now she has absolutely gone off of the deep end. For her I understand how difficult it is to suddenly lose someone who was so close for so long. All though it is the same way for me, I am clearly dealing with it differently. She is now on medication, she is coming to my house, telling my friends that she thinks I am losing my grip on life, texting every day and getting angry when there is no response after twenty minutes. She thinks she still needs me in her life. 

I have absolutely no idea how to deal with this situation. Of course I care for her, I spent a year with her! But in my mind the relationship is over. She believes that the sudden lack of communication means that the last year meant nothing. She clearly needs help, but help from me is the last place it should come from. I don't know how to help her from a distance. I care for her well being, but I can't be the one to help her through this. I am afraid that she will go back to abusing medication in order to numb the pain.

Advice? This is stressing me out in a time where I am already about ready to shut down, and I need to figure something out, soon. Any help would be really great..

We first met through mutual friends, and started hanging out a lot in the same social group, after a few months we started realizing that we saw each other as more of then friends, and started dating. Everything was just so easy and natural, our conversations would just flow effortlessly, our sense of humor and personalities just continuously clicked. It stayed like this for several months until coincidentally, the weekend before my birthday.

Out of nowhere for me, while we were hanging out with a group of friends she pulls me away, and goes on to let out everything on her mind. She told me that she didn't know where she was in life and was unsure of a lot of things most of which I were aware of , and that she needed time to figure things out, I was shocked, and lost for words. I told her that if she really felt she needed it I'd support that, and that is where our relationship in it's romantic sense was put on hold indefinitely.

Since then, we continued to talk in fact probably as much if not a little more then we had, and are in most ways as close as we used to be. We talk from morning to night most days, with mutual participation, about everything. But the feelings for her have never wavered in the slightest, which she is aware of. On a couple of occasions while we were together having a late night conversation, I brought up how I felt in an attempt of possible closure, and never could she manage to give me a straight answer, saying she still didn't know how she felt or if we would get back together which we both mentioned from time to time. She even got in a depute with a girl who she found out had feelings for me, and when I confronted her on why she just said that she never said that she had no feelings for me.

It's been a couple months since the break-up, and while we still our close friends who still talk all the time, but I can't get over these feelings. Preety much all of the things she was wanting to figure out when we separated have been dealt with, but here we are still avoiding the elephant in the room of where we stand. She refuses to through out the idea of us getting back together whenever I asked her if it would be for the best, but she also never tells me how she feels about it.

About a few months ago I felt as though I had last the attraction to her. I've been finding her slightly boring, irritating, and would rather spend time elsewhere than with her. However, she's absolutely in love with me and would want every minute of our days to be together. She has introduced me to her family, her friends, etc. And would describe to me how her family/friends said we're the perfect match. She would always post pictures of us two on FB and Instagram. She would tell me how I'm the perfect man. She would get emotional when I don't spend my free time with her or show my love towards her. She doesn't have many friends and thus needs me always around.

Throughout this whole time I've been reciprocating by faking my love towards her. I would always put a fake smile to her. I would always profess my (fake) love to her. Every time she describes how she imagines us getting married, travelling the world, etc. I would fake smile and agree. I have no idea why I've been doing this. Maybe to make her feel better? So not to get into fights? Because I'm a pussy?

When I went off to college, she remained in the relationship with me the entire time and it never seemed like there was any sort of issue within the relationship either internally or externally.



The month I come home though, issues started popping up. She began to become a little more distant from me. It was nothing that I thought at the time was very serious. She had a lot going on in her life, &amp; I thought there was just some sort of stress going on.



A few days ago while we were on my couch at my house, she started crying and told me she only thought of me as a friend.I was very taken aback by this and asked her why this was happening. The explanation she gave was that around the time that I came home from college, this thought slipped into her head in which she only saw me as a friend. She said that this thought only grew and grew and that it didn't stop. She couldn't stop it.



I was very suspicious at this, and thought there was something else going on.

I agreed that if this was her feelings, then it would be better if we could just be friends from now on.



The morning after this discussion, she sends me a very long text message that contained what she said was the real reason she broke up with me. She said a long time ago something happened to her that ruined anything sexual for her. She wouldn't tell me what exactly it was, but I heavily suspect it was child molestation of some sort. she said that around the time I came home from college, she remembered this event and was sickened by it. Because it ruined anything sexual for her, she said that we wouldn't have a normal relationship anymore. She thought that that would be unfair to me, and she decided to push her feelings of only wanting me to be a friend onto herself. She told me she wouldn't know how long this was going to last, it could go on forever.



I had no idea this was going on at all. I told her that we should make a compromise and that I could help her with this. She said that she was afraid she'd waste my time making any compromises, and that she wanted me to be happy with someone who I can have a healthy relationship with. I begged and begged, but she said she didn't want to waste any of my time.

She's gorgeous, straight A student, and her mind is extremely attractive as well. We've hung out twice outside of school: one was lunch, and another was breakfast/coffee. She's told me she loves me (in a friend way, not romantic), and initiates hugs. We have deep, meaningful conversations, but I think I open up more than she does.

In person, she leaves her phone alone and focuses on me, but when I text her, she doesn't reply much. Maybe I'm just not talking about things that interest her because when I text her serious things about life, she replies, but when it's simple everyday things, I don't always get a reply. Perhaps I catch her at bad times, because she actually did apologize once for not responding. In her defense, she was on vacation. But even during the school year she isn't as responsive, or maybe she's busy studying (she's only ever had 1 B in her college career, and the rest have been A).

When we had lunch, she asked me why I asked her to lunch, and I didn't wanna give myself away, so I said, because I like talking to you; you're really cool, and that seemed to satisfy her, and when I asked her the same question, she said, I thought about all those other times you asked me to hang out, and I was too busy, then she paused for what must've been 30 seconds as if she was choosing her words very carefully, And because there are things about you that I find interesting.

In freshman year, we became good friends. I realized I really liked him, and he felt the same and had been for years but never approached me. 

We were talking, then ended up dating, and got very serious. We were in love, we weren't your typical 2 week long HS relationship. Granted, we never had sex of any kind but we saw each other often, did the usual couple things, talked about sex/were sexual over texting and a bit in person as well. It was great. I was/am completely in love with him, head over heels. 

He had struggled very hard with depression most of his life, and he said I really helped with it. Last February he tried to commit suicide and almost succeeded. He went into a rehab facility for a week, and I had no contact with him and had no idea what had happened (then I didn't have much contact with his family, and his friends didnt know anything.) He got out, we immediately met up and he told me everything. About a month after, I was in a rough time in my life. I had my parents get a divorce, I moved from my childhood home, lost my cat, and my dog of 11 years passed away. He then decided it would be a great time to go on a break. He wasn't sure what he wanted/was depressed again, so we met up and talked and he said he loved me too much to go. After that, we got much better. He went on new meds and we were perfect. That's the point in our relationship I knew I was deeply in love with him. Fast forward to this summer, we would talk constantly and see each other a bit. 

Then, last Friday he threw it on me that he doesn't love me anymore and hasn't for a month and has been trying to regain feelings but can't. An entire month I was lead on like an idiot. I was crushed. I could hardly breathe I was crying so hard. I couldn't eat barely anything for the entire week up until now unless I had some green. (don't judge me on that) I couldn't sleep, I'd wake up in the early hours of the morning from a dream that he came back. It felt so real. I'd cry and cry and not be able to fall back asleep for hours. Everything we shared, did, said, flashed through my mind for the next week. He was extremely sad he had to do this to me and was writhed with guilt. It's silly because we're so young, but less than a month ago he told me he thought I was the love of his life. I said he was mine too, stupidly and pathetically because I thought he was etc...

 I'm doing better and we talked and he said if we ever got back together and started over he'd want to see other people first. That killed me, imagining seeing him with another girl. Makes me want to vomit. I was his first girlfriend so I knew he'd want to move on someday, I just didn't know he'd move on a month before ending it while I still was falling more and more for him. He is my best friend. I have plenty girlfriends, but no one knows me like he does. I love him, truly. I am his best friend and one of the two people he regularly contacts along with his other friend. He wants to stay friends and I do too because I can't imagine him not in my life... but at the same time it hurts to be in contact with him and not be able to act like we're together. It's so weird. My anxiety has heightened and right now I just feel numb. I would do anything to move on. If there's any advice anyone would like to provide me with, I'd happily take it...

Here's some background on our relationship: he and I had been friends for years, since we met in our senior year in high school, before we started to like each other. We went on a few dates and everything went great, but he still had feelings for his ex, so I backed off. However, he continued to flirt with me even though we had agreed to be friends, and later on I found out he had been flirting with me while he and his ex were thinking of getting back together. This was a pretty scummy thing of him to do, and naturally I was hurt and irritated. So we didn't speak for awhile.

We ended up rekindling our friendship again, but he tries flirting with me again. Although I still had lingering feelings for him, I told him we should just remain friends. He agreed. At this point, he hadn't mentioned his ex, and I figured, Maybe they had some kind of fallout. I probably shouldn't mention her in case they did. But then, a few days later, he dropped the bomb on me: he had just broken up with his girlfriend. In other words, he had been flirting around with someone else behind her back.

A few more complicated situations occurred after that, and I told him we needed to keep our distance for awhile. So we did.

Anyway, he just texted me once more a few days ago. He told me he was visiting another country because one of his relatives had just died. I offered my condolences and attempted to be there for him like a real friend would. We were finally having a decent conversation--something that hadn't occurred in awhile--but it wasn't long before he started flirting around with me again and admitted he still had feelings for me. I personally have never rejected anyone in my entire life, so I felt really guilty when I firmly told him we were just going to be friends. Nothing more, nothing less. He seemed down, but he said he understood and agreed that was the best thing for us to do. The thing is that we had already discussed this a few times before and, although he kept agreeing to just being friends, he never lightened up with his flirting, and truth be told I don't think our friendship will be the same again.

I really don't know what I should do. On the one hand, I still care for him and feel guilty anytime I think about cutting off all contact with him. Plus, his relative has just died, and a friend would try to be there lending support for their friend during their darkest time, right? However, on the other hand, it's like he cannot seem to understand that I'm not interested anymore. Conversations with him aren't as easygoing as they used to be, and I'm not comfortable with his flirtations.

What should I do? Should I cut off all contact after all? Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you.

I was together with my ex for 3 years. He was my first boyfriend. We were very much emotionally connected and the break-up was very painful for the both of us. I had grass is greener syndrome. I also realized later (with the help of reading this subreddit) that he was very insecure and emotionally dependent on me-- the pressure of which I couldn't handle for my first relationship and didn't know how to deal with. I suggested it to him but he refused to go to therapy and likened them to glorified motivational speakers (he's Japanese so it might be a cultural thing?).  

We broke up last August. Two months later I meet this other guy [23M], not looking for anything long-term but the relationship sort of stuck. I was upfront with this guy on the fact that I just had a breakup but he wanted to try and make it work.

He tells me he still loves me but would rather I be a part of his life even if just as a friend then not be a part of it at all. He wants to have lunch/dinner with me and my current BF. I brought it up with my current BF and he's open to the idea.

I'm torn because I know he still has feelings for me but at the same time I really would love the mentor-ship and quite frankly, the thought of not getting a job offer by the time I graduate is sort of freaking me out. I need to get a good job-- both for my personal as well as my family's financial sake. 

I guess I'm just curious what people's thoughts are on the ethics of the whole situation. I feel like I've been fairly honest with all parties involved but still... the thought of taking him up on his offer knowing how he feels makes me feel a little icky. 

**tl;dr: Ex offered to mentor me before I graduate. He knows I currently have a boyfriend and that I'm committed to him.

22807,Breakups,2uj4nu,"Long story to explain here but I need some outside input. Basically, I met her about a year and a half ago on a language exchange site. We live in the same city and found out that we got along great. She had a boyfriend at the time but she had already told him that she wanted to break up with him and it was difficult since they lived together as well. 

We got along so well we started texting almost all day every day, but I respected the fact she had a boyfriend and kept my distance. Then they broke up and about 3 months later we got together.

Here's where the trouble began. Only a few weeks into the relationship, I felt something was off and I communicated this with her, she told me she had a secret to tell me, she had been planning to move in to a new apartment with her ex and a female best friend of hers as roommates. She said he needed a place to live too and so in order to avoid the trouble of looking for a roommate, she asked him if he wanted to be roommates with her. She said she has absolutely no feelings towards him anymore and she would never get back together with him.

I was really heartbroken at the time, especially since she originally planned on hiding this from me had I not asked, but because I felt like there was something special about this girl I didn't break up with her right away and told her to either break up with me or find another roommate and not live with him. She chose to find another roommate but my trust in her was severely damaged at that point.

She's always been a secretive person, she deletes all her texts with all her friends and will usually immediately shut the screen on her phone off if I come near her. She says this is just her personality, she doesn't like it if other people see her personal messages, and I can respect that, but seeing as how she hid something big from me when we first started I feel she should be more open with me in order for me to trust her.

Another thing that's usually on my mind is that she would have some pretty flirtatious conversations with me back when she was with her ex. I realize that she said she communicated with him that she wanted to break up at that point but I still hate to think that she could be doing the same to me, and because she's so secretive and private, I would have no idea.

So recently it's become harder for me to accept her secretiveness and blindly trust her considering her past, and we've gotten into several pretty big fights over this. Yesterday she said she couldn't handle me being so suspicious all the time and said she was just naturally a private person and so she said she thinks we're not suitable and so we broke up.

The thing is, when we don't have these fights over being suspicious, secretiveness, etc. we really are great together and I feel so happy with her. I feel like if she was just not so secretive all the time I could trust her and we would be a great couple. I really don't want to lose this girl, there's something about the way we get along that I don't feel with many other people at all, let alone girls, and I feel like that's rare in life, so I'm really reluctant to let her go. She's also really reluctant to split up with me, she says she wants to be with me too but she can't handle me being so suspicious all the time.

I tried to ask her to compromise to be less secretive and I would be more trusting but she says she feels like she's giving up her freedom like this. She also never really accepted responsibility for trying to secretly live with her ex before and that makes me worry that she thinks something like that is ok.

What can I do? I really don't want to lose her. Should I really just blindly trust her after considering what she's done before? It's just hard and I always have a terrible feeling on the inside when I think that she's maybe texting other guys and so doesn't want me to see that, that's a hard feeling to ignore and I always can't help but blurt it out and so I seem like a suspicious person all the time.

I would love and appreciate some outside input here.

**tl;dr**: Girl of my dreams tried to secretly live with ex early on in the relationship. This plus her relatively private nature has caused me to be very suspicious all the time and we broke up yesterday because of this, but I want to be with her very badly.



EDIT: Text conversations with me when she was with her ex weren't really flirtatious, I misspoke. But she was clearly very into me and would talk to me about everything in her life at the time. I even told her I liked her at one point and she said she liked me too but was with her ex and wanted to respect him. Later, she told me she broke up earlier with him in order to be with me.","Me [23 M] with my girlfriend [24 F] 4 months, broke up because of trust issues",0.0,False,3.0,15.0,1422895732.0,/r/relationships/comments/2uj4nu/me_23_m_with_my_girlfriend_24_f_4_months_broke_up/,Romantic
22808,Breakups,1rhsvo,"I just had to post this as I just found out about all this last night. She doesn't actually know that I know. I've been pretty distraught ever since she told me she tried to kill herself and ever since then she has been very distant. It's be almost impossible to get anything out of her about how she was coping with the stress and depression since she told me, and I've been checking her facebook to see if there are any updates on her well being.

Well last night I saw she had a blog linked on her facebook page, so I decided to take a look to see if it would give me any insight as to how she has been. To my horror, the very latest post describes her being happy, and actually doing stuff with her life. I checked the dates, surely something had to be wrong!? It had to be her because it had her picture on the bloggers profile. Already the anxiety starts hitting me hard as I NEVER thought she would lie to me about anything. I'm not a naive person, but I've never actually trusted someone as much as I trusted her.

So I start going through some of the posts starting from the latest blog she made after the time she told me she tried to kill herself. It is important to mention here that there was a gap of a few months in her blog posts. She didn't actually begin re-writing the blog til about a month or so after she told me she tried to kill herself. 

It is at this point the shit hits the fan. Her very first post after her blogging break VERY briefly describes;

*  That summer has put her in better spirits and has made her much happier.

*  That she had a visit from a few foreign friends which she really enjoyed (We actually met on World of Warcraft. I assume this was a some of her WoW friends coming to visit).

*  That she went to Belgium shortly after, where her guild master from WoW lives (I assume he was definitely there with the foreign friends who came to visit). At the end of her visit, she confessed her feelings for him, and they have been in a relationship since then.

Even now it makes me sick to read that line again from her blog. At this time she had led me to believe that we were still together but she was just too sick and depressed to continue with the relationship at that time. She knew however, that I was willing to wait for her to get better and be there for her when she needed me.

So after she told me she tried to kill herself, her messages became very short and far between, though however there were times we had very long and in depth conversations about how she was doing and how bad things were. The significance of this is that by now I believe her story of trying to kill herself may not be true, or at least grossly exaggerated. The depression and constant misery she has told me about after that supposed event has been proven to be a pack of lies.

What hurts me the most is how much I trusted her and confided in her. I've only ever been in two relationships before and the first one started up with me falling for another girl with major issues with depression. Despite my own problems I decided to be the rock she needed during her times of trouble, then when she reached a stage where, with my help, her life began to regain some normality; she ditched me for someone else without a second thought. The more I found out about how much she has lied to me and what has been going on behind the scenes, it seems like history is repeating itself.

I thought I had learned from my mistakes the first time round. And this girl seemed very different from the last one. She was sweet and caring ( or so it would seem ) and she would do anything for anyone. I even confided in her how my first relationship ended and she thought it was disgusting (the irony!), and that she would never do anything like that to me. I believed her.

I realise after a certain amount of time, i'll be over this and happy again. But right now it feels like I cant have a relationship with a woman without being used. That all I'm good for is helping damaged girls get to a point where they're in a state to qualify for a better boyfriend, and a better life.

TL;DR: Girlfriend from long distance relationship told me she tried to kill herself in august, and since that time led me to believe she has been in psychiatric care. Found her blog yesterday by chance, in which since October she describes herself to be leading a normal and happy life, and has found a new partner.

P.S. We were together for a year, visited each other regularly and talked for hours everyday via skype.","I [23 M] just found out my [23 F] from a long distance relationship has found someone new and is living a happy life, after telling me 3 months ago she tried to kill herself and has been in psychiatric care ever since.",0.0,False,6.0,4.0,1385473642.0,/r/relationships/comments/1rhsvo/i_23_m_just_found_out_my_23_f_from_a_long/,Romantic
22809,Dating,1njm2v,"Little background:  I have known this girl for several years.  Met and became fast friends when she was seeing a guy who hung around in the same group of friends as me (wouldn't say friends as I have not seen or talked to him in a long time).  I had a longterm girlfriend at the time. 



Fast forward a year or so, I no longer have a girlfriend and she is single as well.  We have been talking everyday and having sex every time we see each other.  She lives in a town about an hour away, so we do not see each other everyday, but see each other at least a couple times a month (on weekends usually).  



We have been to visit each other in our towns several times, but have virtually never talked about what we are outside of one time.  That was a short talk over a month ago where we both said what we had was really good and nothing official was discussed beyond that.  A couple weeks after, she had been drinking with friends and called me and said that she is never emotional and hated being dramatic, but she had to know what had happened with my long term girlfriend as she was scared that we were going to get back together and she was going to end up attached to me and hurt.  I assured her that there was no chance of this happening and I was really enjoying hanging out with her.  We talked normally the rest of the night after that and in the next couple days, she seemed to open up a little more.  



That ended as quickly as it started.  She went back to being a little shorter in texts and did not want to have deeper conversations.  She came in town that next weekend, and things were great again.  



Basically whenever we are together, we act and it feels llike we are dating.  She stays with me without a question every night she is in town even though she has good girlfriends here.  So now she is back in her hometown and I do not know when I will see her next.  


So my questions are:

1.  Am I overthinking this all and just not used to a girl who is not very emotionally open ?

2.  Should it be assumed that we are exclusive and she is not seeing other guys?


3. How do I assure her that I do not want to get back with my ex?


4. How/when is it right for me to bring up putting a label on it (less of a concern if I know we are exclusive)?


5.  How do I get her to open up more when we can only talk and not see each other everyday?

22816,Dating,27hd8w,"Let me start off by saying that I've only been in one serious relationship. I recently came back into contact with someone I met back in high school, not my high school. Let's call her Mandy. We just knew each other because of mutual friends. I went out about a month ago to a club because an old friend wanted to go and didn't have a ride. I go there and run into Mandy. We end up dancing, kissing, and hooking up that night. We have been talking or just hanging out for about a month now. I have been the first guy she has been with in over 6 months due to her last boyfriend passing away. Whenever I bring up being together or anything like that she gets uncomfortable which is completely understandable. We are both 25. She asked me a question that has been incredibly hard for me to answer. But the question is so simple. She asked me why I like her. I don't like to complicate things. I immediately said that you make me happy. She told me that just a nice and fluffy answer. She's not in a rush or anything for an answer.  Mandy is beautiful, extremely beautiful, and a little weird which is a plus for me. What can I say to her that won't be such a nice a fluffy answer? She also wants me to tell her what I dislike about her. I feel like I haven't spent enough time getting to know her. I do know that she's interested because we have been hanging out quite frequently. At the moment I guess we are just going with the flow. Should I continue to go with the flow and let things happen naturally? Wtf do I do?!

TL/DR: Girl I have been talking to asked me why I like her and wants a deeper answer besides that you make me happy.

Edit: I spoke to her. I told her everything and how I felt straight up and honestly. She said that those are things that are interdependent and she wants a better answer.

Over the 2 years, I have texted and had conversations with her every day for a majority of the 2 years.The longest time we have not talked is probably about a week or 2. I constantly saw her throughout the 2 years for lunch or dinner and we had classes together.
We are pretty good friends and during times, I really feel a connection. She is a great person, and is always so kind towards me. I'm unsure if that kindness is just her being her or if it is any sign of affection towards me.
And I know 2 years is a really long time, but I'm patient and I have been working on other areas of my life as well.

Also, I'm not the type to talk about relationships like this. I'm cringing as I'm typing this out. But I've got to do something. What I'm trying to say is I'm not some whiny kid looking for attention because I have relationship issues. Those kind of kids bug me.

So I first started talking to this girl at the beginning of this semester, and only because we have a few mutual friendly. Immediately I liked her, and I'll be honest, at first it was mainly because she's absolutely gorgeous. As I've got to know her (very slowly, btw) this semester, I realized she is an amazing person. It's tough to describe her, but I can say that out of any girl I've ever met, I've never met anyone that belonged on Earth like her. If that makes any sense, I think that is a huge piece of what I'm so attracted to. I feel like with her, I could finally find my place and live the life I'm meant to live. I could go on, but I'll just keep it short and say that I've fallen in love with her. I hate using that word, I don't think it's the right one, but I don't know what else to call it.

I think this is the root of my problem. I've fallen too deep with someone when nothing has even been started.

Anyways, I was fine with just being friends with this girl. Honestly, I'm not exactly somebody that I would expect a girl like her would like. She is super chill and could get nearly any guy in the school, and turns them down regularly (as she can see that they are just trying to have sex with her. Another thing I like about her). I, on the other hand, am a very scrawny, tightly wound guy with some mild social anxiety, and don't have girls interested in me often.

This whole problem started with a very strange mixed messages from the girl. I won't explain it all, but basically she posted things on tumblr 
about a guy she liked, and then the next day asked me if I had been on tumblr lately the next day. She's very private about her tumblr, not a whole lot of people know about it, and I only had one because I made a joke account a few months back. She had followed it, then I followed her. Of course I hadn't been on tumblr for a month, so I told her that. I go online later that day and see what she wrote, and it seems like an obvious sign that she wanted me to see. A little weird, but she's shy so I found it kind of cute. 

At this point my mind starts going crazy. It seemed so obvious. She liked me, and wanted me to know. It was my turn to act. I had not been that happy in a long time.

I asked our mutual friend what she thought. At first she was doubtful, so she started to ask anonymous questions about this guy on tumblr. This is when it gets weird. She starts talking about someone else who clearly isn't me. 

So this is when a guy should throw in the towel. But, the mutual friend texts me saying that she talked to the girl, and that the responses to the anonymous question was basically just talking about an imaginary guy.

Here's what me and the mutual friend think: She definitely wanted me to see the original tumblr post, and it may have very well been about me. After I indicate that I haven't gone on and implied that I didn't intend to, she replaced me with an imaginary guy to answer the anonymous questions. Yes, I understand this is bizarre. I'm not sure what to do with it either.

I would drop it, but both me and the mutual friend noticed a few very positive signs in class the couple following days.

This is where I blew it. When I thought that I had a chance, I'm sure that I came off as awkward/trying too hard. I didn't even do much, I just tried to show increased interest. She doesn't respond to any texts (although she's said in the past that she sucks at texting), and I think I tried too hard to become somebody that she would be interested in. I feel like when I try to talk to her I'm annoying her. It's tough, she's so shy I cannot tell what she is thinking. I want to stress that I did not ever even directly flirt. I just tried talking about things that she really likes, and I think that she noticed.

I wish so badly that I never found out that she liked me (which I believe she did at one point). Things were going well; I was more relaxed around her, and I was myself. 

She's said earlier that she wants to hang out with me and my mutual friends over the summer. Not having a lot of friends that I actually like, I really need that. I'm sure that this is still on. 

Because of this, I don't want to just tell her how I feel. I can't risk ruining this any more than I have.

So here I am, stuck between 0 and 1. I have never thought about anyone like this or felt like this before. The pure joy I have when thinking something may happen and the sickness to my stomach I feel when I realize it won't has been a constant, daily rollercoaster for the past 2 weeks. I can't take it anymore.

Part of me wants to get over her so badly. Part of me wants to tell her how I feel and hope for the best. Part of me wants to do neither and keep her as a friend, but it's causing me too much pain.

Sorry for the rant. Just writing that out helped, and if you guys can offer any advice, even better! 

Thanks.

My boyfriend and I have had a rough three years. We always seem to find our way back to eachother despite everything. 

The past few months have been hell however. Everything was going really well before that and we were looking for places to live together. The night we need to decide on a place he backs out and doesn't want to, and I get upset and hurt and well.. argument happens. It was a bad argument. After that, we fought constantly. We didn't see eachother for weeks, he didn't want to see me, he was cold and hateful, we just fought and fought. Mostly it was me trying to call and calm things down and not argue anymore, and that would just piss him off more. I was at a loss. I felt we were falling apart completely and there was little hope of ever being happy together.

One night, two months ago, he said he wanted to break up and leave me. He said he didn't love me or want me.. and that it was over, and I was delusional to hold onto anything with us. He blocked my number and my information. I was devestated. I honestly thought he was done with me. So I fucked up. I went and hooked up with a friend of mine.  My friend cares really deeply for me and I guess I just wanted to feel loved and wanted by someone. I don't know. It was a stupid thing to do.

After that, my bf contacts me.. and we continued arguing.. fighting.. and then finally after some time he changes his mind and tells me he wants to make it work and try. So we try. And it's good. I cut my friend out of my life completely the moment he said he wanted to try with me. 

But I still felt like shit having slept with someone else. And I hate lying. He had suspicions and kept asking me if there had been anyone else and I just kept denying it because I was honestly scared of how he'd react. A few weeks go by and we are actually working on things and getting back to how it was when it was good... and I end up confessing to him about that guy. He.. doesn't take it very well. That morning he stripped my clothes off and threw me outside naked.. He said he wanted to humiliate me like how I humiliated him...

Later on he apologized.. but it's been a week since he found out and we were talking calmly about things.. today he sends me tons of texts saying I'm a cheating whore and a slut and a selfish piece of shit.. and blocks me on everything. I guess that's how he wants to end it..

So I'm left feeling.. terrible. Scared to lose him for good. Not ready to I guess. Questioning why I did what I did. Coming to terms with fucking everything up.. I know I deserve it, I guess it's just incredibly painful and I don't know where to go from here.

Sorry. That was really long. I'm not even sure how to sum it up in a tldr.

Edit* tldr; slept with someone after my boyfriend blocked me. Lied to him about it when we were trying to make it work. He reacted badly. Emotionally messed up at this point.

Question - not sure where to go from here. I feel like shit.

22827,Breakups,1veuml,"Hello, looking for validation and/or advice. I lurk on this sub often but have never posted. Apologies on the length.
About two weeks ago I broke up with my exboyfriend. I had been considering it for 3 weeks. We dated 3 months. We broke up over incompatibility. The breakup itself went fine. He was a little passive aggressive at first but in the end seemed to agree that it was for the best. We agreed to stay friends.

The next day I was running to class with my phone in hand and accidentally called him. I hung up, got into my seat, and he called me back. I sent him a quick text explaining the pocket call and that I was trying to give him some space, and not to think I was ignoring him. He replied Why don't you just delete my number and then it won't happen again? I thought he was joking too soon so I told him there was no need to be rude, and he replied that it wasn't a sarcastic comment. I wasn't really sure how to take that (read earlier: passive aggressive) and just decided not to reply. Later he texted and said Yeah, so we're not gonna be friends if that wasn't clear. 

It had been about 24 hours and I understood if after taking some time to mull it over he had decided he couldn't be friends with me for whatever reason, so I didn't question it. Unfortunately I realized I had left things at his place and asked if I could come get them. He said yes, and that there would be no problems face-to-face.

He had unfriended me on facebook. The day before I was going to get my things (roughly 3 days later) he had requested my friendship again on Facebook. My first thought was how childish it was, and I chose to hold off on adding him back. He also texted later in the day that we would talk when I came over.

I went over the next day and he handed me my stuff. We spoke. Basically, it boiled down to him not feeling like I cared about him as a person and that if that was the case he would prefer not to be friends. I cared about him as a person, but I was having a hard time drawing the line so that it was clear we weren't getting back together. He understood. I told him if there was anything else he wanted to ask or know, then was the time, because I didn't want to discuss it again. He was quiet and then said, So... do you ever think you might be a sociopath? I mean I looked and some of the qualities you have, but the others not really... It didn't bother me until the next day when I had a WTF moment and I decided that was justification to distance myself and keep him as an acquaintance rather than a friend. I still didn't add him back.

A few days later he texted asking Yo what happened to adding me back? I told him I was considering it and he didn't understand but let it go. The next day I decided I would add him for reasons that had happened the previous evening that were unrelated. He texted a thanks.

Most recently he texted Hey ex what's up? That really bothered me because never would I address an ex that way, nor would anybody say that in real life because it's so awkward. I told him not to address me like that and he said, Haha I knew you wouldn't like it... (rest of text). I asked him that if he knew I wouldn't like that, why would he do it? He said Because I wanted to. 

I guess unrelated side note, but now a mutual friend of ours has stopped talking to me, not even replying to my text if we were still on speaking terms. That's fine, whatever (he was better friends/friends with her before meeting me), but I can't help but think that he is probably fueling that fire and it annoys me.

I was casually dating a girl for a few months and we are both Juniors at the same school. We met up five times during the summer (we were really busy, gone for weeks at a time).
We don't have a ton of time to spend time together now that school has started (we are both in sports after school), but I was hoping that at least when I got my drivers licence (in about 2 weeks) we could go out on the weekend.

Anyways, we hung out after school on Tuesday for 45 minutes and just walked around talking before sports practice. Wednesday night I texted her asking if she wanted to spend lunch or the after school period on Thursday together and she responded something like wtf we just hung out Tuesday. She had also previously (a few days before) said she was busy on the weekend (going to a concert) so I knew I wouldn't be able to see her that weekend.
I don't want to transcribe the whole conversation, but basically she wants a really casual relationship. She said she doesn't want/need to/have time to hang out a lot... the doesn't want to and harshness of her tone really set me off and after a little more back and forth I said something along the lines that I wanted something more serious and couldn't stand being able to see her for only an hour a week. I can understand her wanting to hang out with her friends but she definitely phrased it more harsh than that.

What I can't escape is that she never said she didn't want to date, she never said she didn't like me, she just wanted something casual. And instead of working with that I got caught up in wanting more faster and now I feel I just fucked everything up. Seeing her once a week is better than nothing, and over time that could have developed into something more serious. In other words at least there was hope in that scenario.

I have been obsessed with this girl for months (still am) and I'm not sure I can live with this feeling that I fucked it up.

22831,Dating,2x4dai,"Alright /r/relationships. A little over a month ago my bf and I broke up when he started facebook-ing a woman that I had expressed a problem with. She had been flirting with him in front of me, grabbing his hand, and he reciprocated. Grabbing her hand, flexing for her. When I said it made me uncomfortable, he said that he appreciated the attention, it was gratifying, and that he wasn't flirting with any intentions. A week later he told me that they had been facebook messaging back and forth, about their relationships and about life in general. I looked at them. Bad snooper. He has always been attracted to older women, this woman is 42 years old and has a 20 year old son. He told her that he had a crush on her. She had a crush on him. They had agreed to do nothing about it because they were both in relationships. Confronting him, he admitted to having a crush on her and told me that it doesn't matter where he got the feelings, as long as he came home it wasn't cheating. I told him, under no uncertain terms, that this was an emotional affair and that I wasn't going to deal with it anymore. We broke up. 

He contacted me three weeks later, telling me how much he missed me. He expressed that he didn't realize just how much I was enmeshed in his life, how underappreciated I had been, how he missed having me in his life. A week later, we hooked up. I had been dating, as had he, and though I hadn't been physically intimate with anyone on our break, he had. This woman he told that he didn't want anything to do with anymore, on Valentines Day, and broke plans with her to hang out with me (no sex) on Valentines instead. 

We have since hooked up again. Spent the night together as well as going on dates. Though he still maintains that he was not unfaithful to me, he understands my hangups. We have decided to keep it casual at the moment, talking during the days, but seeing each other once a week at best. He constantly is texting me while he is at work, brought me flowers for no reason on Wednesday on his way home, and otherwise have been actually trying to get back. Though we have not had an in-depth discussion about what we are, he did express an interest in working things out and righting the wrongs. 

I have never ever considered getting back with an ex before. People are saying that I am being a doormat. Am I being a doormat or, as my mind is trying to tell me, am I giving a chance to something that might actually be great in the long run. At this point, I'm turning to you, internet strangers, who do not know me or him, to give me some advice.

We've been together for over half a year now. Everything started out great! Amazing, actually! We fell head over heels in love with each other instantaneously. We couldn't get enough. So we decided to get an apartment together, due to certain living situations.

A few months into the apartment, we begin to fight and go at each other like children. Cops get called, we both get arrested. And we now see that we've really fucked this up. But we forgave each other and promised to 'bury the hatchet.' 

A week ago, we made this life changing connection. We suddenly realized that we were the others' half. That we were soul mates. Well, I guess I just realized that. From that night, I continued to fall deeper and deeper in love with him. Apparently, he was falling out of love with me instead.

A few days ago, we got into an argument and I ended up leaving him 'stranded' at his parents house. He got mad at me and ignored my, arguably obsessive, constant calls. I was just worried about him. I called his friends to speak to him and he seemed nonchalant and promised to talk when he got home. Well . . . he came home, alright. He stormed into the apartment, started grabbing anything of his and said I'm breaking up with you. And left. 

He came back the next day, grabbed more of his things (this time with help from his parents) and refused to even talk to me. He's since turned his cellphone off, so I can't reach him and he will not answer any messages on Facebook. 

Today, he will be coming back to pick up the rest of his things, to 'finalize' everything. I can't just let him walk out of my life. I love him far too much to just let him go. I've promised him over and over that I would change, and he's given me so many chances... but this time, I have. 

I don't know what to do, Reddit. What does he want me to do? How do I get through to him and get him to sit down and talk to me? How do I show him that I've truly changed and want to fix everything? Please, I need some hope left in this. I really, really could not handle losing him.

The first 2 years in our relationship were great and it seemed like nothing could break us apart. At this time her parents began to sabotage our relationship. To this day I really don't know exactly why they did it but it escalated to a point where they locked up my girlfriend inside her room so she couldn't leave and be with me. 

After this day my gf avoided all contact with her parents and we rented a nice place to live together. Again 2 years passed without any real complications.

After a long day of debates between the two of us she accepted the car (I was against it because I feared that her parents just wanted to buy their way back in her live. I wasn't against her having contact with her parents but I thought the way the parents did things was odd)

22847,Infidelity,3i9bdp,"I have been dating my boyfriend Jared on and off for the past 4 years. Our relationship is nowhere near perfect, but the one thing that has never been an issue is faithfulness. During our time together, I have not had any inappropriate interactions with other men and, up until yesterday, I have been 100% positive that he's been faithful to me as well. In the beginning of our relationship, I was uncomfortable with the fact that he seemed to have so many close female friends, but a few months into the relationship, I was completely convinced that he only had eyes for me. 

&amp;nbsp;

I feel like a quick description of Jared's relationship past could be relevant, and then I will get into the meat of what the hell has been going on. I am Jared's first long-term girlfriend. I am the only girl who has ever been introduced to his parents and the only girl who has ever lived with him. Honestly, I kind of thought he was a virgin when we met, but I think he was just really inexperienced. He's basically a total nerd who pretends to be a ladies man, but everyone knows he's not. He looks and acts like McLovin. He is literally McLovin's doppelganger. I thought he was adorable and fell for him HARD.

&amp;nbsp;

So, let's fast forward to yesterday. Jared was at work and I was home alone using his laptop. I pulled up Facebook and he was still logged in. This is not an uncommon thing. I've never snooped before, but a message popped up from one of Jared's close female friends, Krista. The message looked a little suspicious, so I scrolled through the thread. What I discovered is that Jared has had some serious feelings for Krista since LONG before he and I started dating. I wouldn't have a problem with it if the feelings had ended as soon as Jared and I started dating. But no. The flirting, teasing, sexual comments, and innuendos continued long into mine and Jared's relationship. Jared admitted to Krista several times that he had feelings for her and wished he had gotten a chance with her. Basically, Jared always wanted to be with Krista, but she always had a boyfriend and strung Jared along. So here I am, feeling like a total piece of shit, knowing my boyfriend of 4 years had feelings for another girl all along. 

&amp;nbsp;

It doesn't end with Krista. 

&amp;nbsp;

Furious, I scoured the rest of Jared's Facebook messages. It turns out he is a completely different person online. He messages random girls he finds on People you may know, he flirts with several of our mutual female friends, and he even tries to arrange to meet up with them. He calls them beautiful and tries to lay on the charm. If the girls are into it, he gives them his phone number. If they don't seem into it, he just keeps fucking messaging them. He's THAT guy. He's the Facebook creep that hits on random girls. And it's been going on since 2012 (at least). 

&amp;nbsp;

How many of those girls texted him? Has he met up with any? Has he physically cheated on me? Is he still in love with Krista? Is the only reason he's with me because I'm the only girl who actually gave him a shot?

&amp;nbsp;

I'm not sure I want to know the answer to any of those questions. My reason for posting this is to get it off my chest and to read what you guys think about the situation. 

&amp;nbsp;

And to those of you who might tell me to break up with him: I did. I actually punched him in the eye and he fell to the ground. I know assault is super not cool, but holy fuck it felt good. The slight problem with breaking up is that we both just moved out of state together 2 months ago. We hardly have any friends and we absolutely can't afford to live on our own (we moved to a tourist town -- crazy expensive cost of living). We are 2 months into a 1 year lease. Luckily, we rented a 2 bedroom apartment so I went out and bought my own bed and moved all his shit into the spare bedroom! 

&amp;nbsp;

OH, and speaking of moving... Jared got a very special going away present from a DIFFERENT girl before we moved. She spent hours doing a painting for him. According to Jared, they were only friends and never really talked. But who the fuck spends hours doing an intricate painting on canvas for a guy you never really talk to and also has a girlfriend? Answer me that.

&amp;nbsp;

What should I do now? How serious do you guys think this is? How in the actual fuck is it possible to know someone for 4 years and not actually know them?

22854,Breakups,2y09xr,"So my GF and I have been going out for 1 year and 3 months. We're each other's first relationships and first times. We've been pretty happy but even though we've never yelled at each other, we've had serious talks. The two biggest subjects were porn and privacy. When she discovered I was looking at porn in the early stages of our relationship, she got very emotional and cried a lot. She tried to ban me from it and I told her she couldn't do that. One day, while I was in the shower, she looked through my phone and found my browsing history. She became very upset and left my house before I was even out of the shower. After what I guess could be called an argument, we agreed I wouldn't look at porn anymore in exchange for my privacy. Seems like a shitty deal but I figured I didn't need porn and was willing to give it up for a working relationship.

That was the first 6 months of our relationship. Nearing our 1 year anniversary, a new problem arose. She didn't want me hanging out with some of my coworkers because out of the group of 5, only one was male. I couldn't go to the movies with them, I couldn't go to Taco Bell with them. 4-5 months later and I feel like this issue still isn't resolved. I point out how it's not fair and how she doesn't seem to trust me but she insists that she does and remains adamant.

The most recent issue is that she doesn't want me watching nude/sex scenes in movies or TV shows. She will literally cover my eyes because she doesn't want me to enjoy the scene. I couldn't justify wanting to be able to watch in our most recent conversation but I feel like it shouldn't even matter.

Looking at it objectively, I see that she's being controlling, manipulative, distrusting, and inconsiderate of my emotions. The problem is that she doesn't really mean to. It's sort of like innocent ignorance. What's more is that her family is extremely rude to her. They treat her like a servant and always put her down. I want to treat her better and I sure as hell don't want to break up with her and send her back to them. The main issue is that she wants to move out with me. Within the year. I don't feel like I'm ready and when I tell her this, she cries. If I move out with her, I'm committing to a relationship I'm not sure I can stay in and if I break up with her, I take away her hope of getting away from her family and I break her heart. I'm her high school sweetheart and she is extremely clingy. She calls me her one true love talks about getting married in the future.

22855,Breakups,3cnv0g,"This story begins at the end of 2013 where I get a new female coworker. Our friendship sprouted really fast and we were talking very often.  My girlfriend wasn't fond of this at all and expressed her concerns.  Unfortunately I seen it as being immature because our relationship was strictly friends (this does not change throughout the duration of our friendship).  

We get closer and have a break up around March 2014 over this after my girlfriend confronted her about petty things and getting no where.  Unfortunately we have said inappropriate things (as a joke, I know this doesn't make it any better.) this includes complimenting each other, offering her a place to shower in the middle of the winter(her hot water turned off and she declined anyways)  however all of these things stemmed from a good hearted nature.  I knew she would offer me the same thing. Lastly, me telling her I am happy to talk to her. 

My girlfriend found out all of these things by going through my phone. This is a grey area because I know she meant well and was insecure.  Looking back I wish I handled everything differently rather than being upset with her insecurities. 

This break up lasts 2 months until I get up off my ass and chase her because I didn't want to lose the best thing in my life and I seen how sad we were apart (she went on a binge drink spree where I would constantly follow up and either made sure she got home or picked her up and drive her home myself)  we definitely had deep talks within these 2 months and still showed that we cared for each other, so my affection was not one sided. 

We got back together with the promise that I would stop talking to my coworker who is now working at a different branch.  I was bitter about the decision but understood her insecurities. We're happy for 3 months, September rolls around, and she adds me on blackberry messenger. I add and then delete her quickly (no messages exchanged, I didn't know it was her because it just shows a BBQ PIN)  and I don't say anything about it until she asks.. She felt like I was hiding stuff from her and would like me to be more open (in scenarios like this I never found a way to just bring it up without making her upset or sad.. And unfortunately still don't know how to do it). 

A month later my coworker messages me and I reply. I know I had No reason to and I'm totally in the wrong for it.  We continue to message back and forth (still strictly friends, again this does not change ever) and my gf eventually finds out again by going through my phone.  She becomes a little bit suicidal and I try my best to console her and apologize for the things I did wrong.  I don't think she was actually suicidal but more so a cry for help and attention..  She tried to hang herself with a scarf in my bathroom, jumped out of a moving car and scraped her knees (30km/h luckily) after an argument turned bad. 

We got over it and again I promised this was the last time.  I wouldn't talk to her anymore. We promised to try our best to keep one another happy through communication and not getting angry when we disagree. (this is mostly on me.  I devolved in our relationship and didn't handle arguments the same).

  Fast forward to March and my coworker's(let's call her Veronica to make this section less confusing) branch loses power for the day so she comes to mine to work.  My gf also happens to be spending the day with Veronica's coworker(tommy)  as they went to high school together and he kind of just disappeared. They catch up and Tommy let's my gf know that Veronica is at my branch, so she confronts me about it (this bad because I never volunteered this information to her, mainly because I didn't know how..  This is what I meant by earlier that I'm not sure how to bring up these type of things that could potentially make us fight). She asks me if I talked to her.  I said no.  (truth) and my story eventually changes to me saying I waved to veronica (also true, they're both true..) my Gf feels I'm changing my story at this point. 

The next day Tommy tells my gf that veronica yelled at him for telling my gf where she(veronica)  was.  My gf confronts me again and asks if I said anything because the only person that knows who said this was me.  I again tell her the truth that I didn't say anything, however I was visibly upset over the situation at work.  This turns out be a ploy from Tommy to try to get us to fight and break up(I have never been insecure about guys with my Gf because I understood that she loved me and nothing would come between that.  That's why I never really cared or thought much when she hung out with him).  

March 17th she pushes the subject and wants to use my phone to contact veronica and ask her about these things.  I tell her she's being irrational and it gets into a heated conversation where she tells me I'm lying because my story changed and makes it sketchy (go from not saying anything to waving). I storm out of her house for the night. 

This is where I find out that being yelled at was a ploy because I asked their mutual coworker what happened in a playing dumb manner.  He had no idea what I was talking about (he's a close friend as well so it's not like he would lie)  and I outright explained the situation and asked if it happened. He said no nothing like that ever happened. So I had the truth now. 

March 18th comes (our month-iversarry)  and we're still not talking until the evening rolls by.  She messages me and apologizes for the way she's acting as it's not true to our promise earlier.  She asks if I can come by and we can watch our shows that we watch together and just enjoy each other's company.  I verify that she won't bring up the mess earlier and she  confirms it.  I come over and not 5 minutes later does the conversation devolves to March 17th's. She eventually realizes what's happening when I told her I want out because this is ridiculous.  I explain to her  how hard I'm trying and that I'm doing exactly what we need to be happy. She agrees apologizes and asks me to stay.  Unfortunately I'm already hot headed at that point and already asked to break up.  She blocks the door and tries her best to hold on to me to get me to stop leaving..  I picked her up multiple times to move her from the door(she got bruises from this :/ I felt terrible and it hurts to actually type this out) this is after I politely ask for her to move for half an hour.  When she doesn't after this is when I get angry.  I scream things that I would never ever say in a million years. We broke up that night. We were both dealing with a lot of stress from school (I was completing my undergrad, and she was taking extra courses for her degree in the sciences) 

A week later and veronica messages me.  I'm still upset over the break up but I responded thinking we are broken up I should be able to do anything.  We have a short conversation as I'm not in the mood to talk at all. 

My gf and I eventually start talking again and I tell her the whole Tommy situation and the truth behind it.  She tells me yeah, I eventually realizes he was psycho and had a thing for me.  She asks me if I spoke to veronica.  I said yes but briefly. This is the straw that broke the camel's back and she decided she would move on from this point.. 

We start to hangout and study for exams together after this point as friends.. It's obvious we still cared about each other.. I was unsure whether or not I wanted to get back together because of the issues we were having.  I still loved her with all my heart but felt it was best to try to rekindle things after our exams.  So I wait, (until April 24th) and luckily win a pair of one Republic tickets from work. I invite her after we stopped talking because it was getting tough to deal with one another's company. We were still arguing about the same old thing.  Unluckily I also get into a car accident with her in it as I'm pulling out of her neighbourhood. (I can't help but think had we gone this would've been a turning point and we would be together).  I stress the importance of going to a doctor to get her checked out because she was telling me she was in a lot of pain.  She finally succumbs to my decision and we go the next day.  She gets an xray done and changes clothes. I was in charge of all her belongings including her phone.. I went through it.  It turns out she was starting and already in a potentially sexual relationship with my sister's ex bf from a couple years back (who I still was friends with because despite everything we were still what I thought was close to each other).... 

He's 30. Everything eventually comes out and she said she's not coming back to me because I spoke to veronica. Had I not this would be a different story. She's moving on, and I was devastated.  We try our best to maintain our roles of each other's best friends because we were prior to the relationship.  It eventually leads to the guy (bobby)  telling her he'd like it if she didn't talk to me.  I comply with it because I want her to be happy but she always messages me.  So I reply.  Eventually she gets caught talking to me and she lies about it saying she went through our convo and was reminiscing.  We moved our form of conversation to writing in google keep (this was a big part of our relationship as a way we left each other love letters).  Eventually she just stopped talking to me all together after I told her I started to talk to someone on tinder( I didn't see it going anywhere I just wanted to see her reaction).  She cried. Told me she knows it's selfish but she is jealous.  Our talks get slower on keep because I don't feel comfortable talking to her when her bf forbade it.  

She eventually starts to insult the tinder girl calling her a slut and what not.(her fb profile pictures are extremely revealing)  Telling me that this was a big upgrade from her (sarcasm) I have no idea where this came from. I wasnt defensive but I constantly asked where this was coming from.  I was hurt. 

That was in June.  Now if I ever message her she tells me she's uncomfortable talking to her and I should leave her alone.  I'm sad and lonely.  I miss her.  I lost my best friend, and was betrayed by a good friend.  



I'll admit I wasn't the best boyfriend as I constantly was juggling her, work and school.  I paid bills in my house and always spent my spare time working. We still saw each other almost everyday either to study or to play games at night.  I could tell she was getting bored of our routine because she wanted to go on vacations.  I always said no (I never told her this but I felt that  I didn't want to go because my parents barely get to enjoy life, why should i deserve a vacation?)  this also drove a wedge between us as I was just an extremely busy person.  Her new bf has a lot of disposable income and a lot of free time.. Sigh.  I never felt so inadequate in my life.

I don't know what to do anymore.  Mentally I'm stuck.  I finally got around to putting away our pictures and everything and bawled my eyes out.  I don't know what the next step is. I'm worried about their age gap. I'm worried about her. I still pay her phone bill and for her gym membership (I don't even know how to bring this up) But I think she's happy without me..

(also, I'm sorry if this is the wrong subreddit.)

During the entirety of our relationship, my boyfriend and I have been sexual together. Although, it's been thickly one-sided.

It started off as me giving him back rubs and tummy rubs. It was very peaceful and romantic. Then, one night, he gently guided my hand down his pants. It was only about a week after we started dating. It took about 2 months for me to work up the courage to try oral, and as time went on, I (with happy permission) tried things further down the sexual roster (full nude humping &gt; hotdogging &gt; prostate stimulation &gt; etc). However... 

I have always been the one to initiate. I cannot remember a single time when he did. Maybe that's not a big deal, but it makes me wonder if he finds me desirable.

He almost never touches me, outside of grabbing my breasts/nipples and occasionally pinching my butt. Rarely does he try to stimulate my nethers (as I call it). When he does touch me, it's always after I've finished him once or twice, and usually it's just a brief back rub (even though that feels great anyway). Occasionally he'll tease by grabbing my butt, but then he'll just stop and roll over, then finally fall asleep.

When he does go for my nethers, it is done hastily. He immediately starts energetically rubbing my clit and I have to squirm away or try to gently move his hand. He often doesn't budge his hand, and so I've had to tell him that it doesn't feel good. Then he just rolls over, pouts, and doesn't try again... and eventually falls asleep. 

I've tried to talk to him about it, but as much as he loves having it done to him, he doesn't like to talk about it. He can't say the word sex. He always says I don't want to say it or what we're talking about, or just refers to it as Meowing. I've told him all of this as gently as I can. I keep his dignity in mind. I've tried to give him tips, and I've told him (briefly) what I like and how I like it. But he always seems to forget by the time he actually goes for it. These conversations make him uncomfortable.

Furthermore, he doesn't want to have sex. I do. Badly.  But, I know I can't pressure him, and I haven't. I brought penetration up once after we'd been dating several months, and since hearing his thought, I have dropped it entirely. He wants to wait until marriage, and I can respect that.

But, I feel like that's easier for him to go through. I do ALL I can to him OTHER than penetration. He rarely touches me down there, and has not explored anything outside of my clit. He went down on me once, and briefly. I shower daily, I keep myself shaved and pleasant... I can barely stand the thought of remaining this frustrated for another few to several years.

He showered last night, which usually provokes me to go down on him. But, I didn't. I rolled over and waited to see if he'd initiate. He poked my buttcheek a few times, humped me for a few seconds, then rolled over and stopped despite my physical responses. 

I have no idea what to do - I'm at a loss. Please help me figure out what I'm doing wrong. :(

As a disclaimer; my boyfriend is not a bad guy. I don't want to paint a bad portrait of him. He's generous, kind, and always helpful to everyone, I promise. :P And he has done it *perfectly* once.

About a week ago I was introduced to a new group of friends through a mutual friend. They are all really nice, fun, and all around good guys. I have been hanging out with all of them almost every day since I met them. (I have always just gotten along better with guys than girls)
Out of the group there is one guy who has really stood out to me. He is a genuine good guy and has so many qualities and characteristics that draw my interest. He also has strong beard game that attracts me too. I think it is pretty clear that we are both into each other.

22866,Breakups,2qbdxk,"Hello all,


This is my first time posting. I hope I don't break any rules or anything but I can't live like this anymore.


Long story first the short version is at the bottom:
I have been dating this amazing guy for over a year now. I honestly thought we were happy and doing great. 


Lately I've been very emotional. I have troubles paying attention in college because the subjects don't intrest me. The class I am in doesn't really like me and ignores me for most of the time. My uncle got very sick, my mom has a drinking problem, I'm getting bullied at the place where I live.. It's too much for me.


Thing is: I'm lonely. I don't have many friends. The person I dated before this person was very abuse and after I had the guts to break up with him he made sure all my friends left too. I have been lonely ever since. 


2 years ago (2012) I stared a new education. I met my now ex there. I fell in the love the moment I met him. And to my luck: He liked me too. We started dating and we were doing fine. At least I thought we did.

 A week ago he started texting me after we had just met in person. It got emotional so I tried to call him. 'cause you know; you can read a text in so many wrong ways. At the end of the call he broke up with. Said he couldn't take it any longer.


This came as a shock to me. I knew I wasn't at my best for the past few weeks but I was getting better. I got therapy, moved out, I honestly did my best and that what hurst the most. Not only didn't I see it coming at all. I tried so hard...



I don't know what to do now. I took up extra hours at work to pay for his gift. I gave up my whole vacation to pay for the darn thing.  Everything I go there I'm reminded why I took up the job in the first place.


I can't sleep. I can barely eat. I feel miserable all the time. I want to talk to him but I know I shouldn't. It won't matter anyway. I feel miserable. Imagine: You with 2 broken legs and your crutches get kicked away from you. That's how I feel. 



I did try to talk to him the other day. 2 days after we've broken up. I tried to explain that I will get better but even though he says he loves me he can't be together with me anymore.


We go to the same school, we're in the same class even. I am not looking forward to going back. 


Tomorrow is Christmas and I feel awful. I just want to curl up in bed. My parents have been kind to me but I can feel they don't know how to deal with it any more. I don't know how to deal with anymore. I just want to feel happy again and go out and do things.

 

To add insult to injury: I'm lonely. As mentioned before I don't have many friends. I only meet people through the anime conventions that I visit and most of those friendships don't last. I don't go out to drink because I'm scared of meeting people and I'm scared my hobbies might put them off.



I also don't feel pretty anymore. He was the only person to ever call me pretty and I don't feel it anymore. I can't wear make up due to allergies so I can't do nothing about making me feel better about myself.

My biggest fear is being alone forever and never meeting people anymore. I will be graduating this school in 2 years and I don't plan on studying more. The job I will get is not one that allow me to meet guys. Or I think I won't anyway.



TL;DR: What is your advice for a person who just lost everything in her life and has no friends to turn to. What is your advice? Will I ever find somebody who I can love again? And how would I go about that. 


Even shorter version: I don't want to live anymore.","Me [22 F] will be spending the holidays alone after my boyfriend over a year [22,M] broke up with me.",0.0,False,3.0,9.0,1419459556.0,/r/relationships/comments/2qbdxk/me_22_f_will_be_spending_the_holidays_alone_after/,Romantic
22867,Breakups,253c58,"We dated for over a year, 13 months to be exact.  SHe told me that she had never loved someone this much, and that she had dreamed about a man like me on her flight out to the state where we met.  I flew across the country twice to meet her parents, relatives, grandmothers, college friends, everyone.  They all loved me, I was a part of the family.  She had told her whole family that I was the man she was going to marry.  They all approved.

I believed her.  At first, we were simply courting each other, but months down the line she would tell me that I was the man of her dreams, and that she wanted me to put a ring on her finger and start a family with her.  I should have seen the red flags, since this was only months into our relationship, but I was in love.  We were both in love.  I was her world, and she was mine.  I was the funniest guy she's ever met, and she was the funniest woman I've ever met.

Around late autumn and winter I became depressed.  A textbook quarter life crisis.  I was having an inner battle with myself about what to do with my worthless college degree.  I became disillusioned and uninterested in most things.  I thought moving would cure my depression.  After we broke up, she told me to move where ever I needed to and then come back and get her when I was ready.

She is a very, very social person.  She thrives on it.  Some might classify her as a type A personality:  she constantly needs stimulation, social encounters, outside activities, live shows, drugs, alcohol, anything and everything to make the most of the moment.  I can be the same way, just not as often.  I enjoy my time in front of the TV.  I am also an active outdoorsy type.  We live in Colorado so doing anything outdoors is easy.  But we rarely did that.  She works two jobs.  It was hard to make a mountain get away.  I don't enjoy live shows or large social interactions as much as she does.  I guess that's incompatibility item number one.

Anyway, she said she began to feel unfulfilled and bored.  This was about 2-3 months ago.  She said we never did anything fun.  My adamant opinion is because we don't get but a measly couple hours a day to see each other, and that's after the sun has set.

Things got worse, and we eventually took a break for a few days.  When we reconvened she said we needed to break up because we don't inspire each other anymore.  She felt like she had outgrown this relationship.  She said she still loved me and she wished so badly that things could be different, but she just needs to be single for awhile.  She feels that we both need to grow, and that we need to do it on our own.

I'm very conflicted.  I agree with some of what she says.  I try very hard not to, but I call bullshit.  I think she got bored.  She is a free spirited woman and I feel like a placeholder for that time and place in her life, and now I can be checked off the list.  I was her world for the better part of a year, and we had high hopes for our future.  We were going to live together.  We were going to establish some good jobs in Colorado and make a temporary life and then move to her home state to be with her family.  It all sounded so wonderful.  We had a plan.  Wrong, what we really had was a pipe dream.  

We work in the same institution, but different buildings.  I saw her today.  We began to bicker almost immediately about some purse she was wearing and a joke I made.  She gets frustrated and annoyed at the smallest things I say or do.  It makes me feel like a fucking moron because I can't keep up with her intellect.

Anyway, much like any fresh dumpee I ruminate over what I have lost.  I also ruminate over what I did wrong and if I only had the smarts to fix it before I lost her.  My insecurities, depression, and negative thoughts got in the way of a relationship with a woman who loved me very much.  But then again, my brain asks me, if she loves you very much, wouldn't she have tried harder to work through this rough patch with you?

So I'm led to believe that she isn't finished exploring her single life, or her single ambitions, or whatever her motive may be.  I felt like I was holding her back from being even more remarkable than she already is.  So I'm led to believe she got bored.  Or maybe I'm wrong.

22870,Breakups,2behmc,"I don't know what I'm looking for with this post. Maybe a chance to get this off my chest. Any feedback is welcome. 

For simplicity's sake, I'll call the guy in this situation Ben. I've been in love with Ben since I was 14. We were high school sweethearts, had a very intense but tumultuous relationship for 4.5 years before I left the state for college and he joined the military. We kept in frequent contact after our breakup for the next two years. Contact dropped off to once every couple of weeks or months in late 2012 when he started dating the girl he is currently seeing, Ashley. As far as I know, their relationship is good. 

A few weeks ago, Ben returned to town for a weekend to see famg and asked if I'd like to catch up one night while he was in town. We went to a bar and hung out and talked. It was like nothing had changed between us. I knew at that moment that I still had feelings for him. Instead of spending the weekend with friends and fam, he spent almost an entire 4 days with me, culminating in us holding hands and falling asleep together talking. It's also at this point that I realize that I'm a terrible person. 

He returns to his life out is state. Mid-week I receive a message from him saying he'll be back in town for the weekend and would like to hang out. We do. Holding hands and talking ensues. Later in the following week he goes on a trip with Ashley's family and his Facebook is plastered with pictures of them smiling together. 

The next week, same thing happens. We hang out Friday because he meets me at a house party I had been attending with friends. I am beyond coherently drunk, not that it makes a difference. We end up making out pretty extensively, but nothing further happens. We go to dinner the next night and I reject his attempts to kiss me. He tells me he's in love with me and always has been, but the situation with Ashley is complicated because she loves him a lot and he doesn't want to, in his words, destroy and devastate someone who doesn't deserve it. 

At this point I know I'm a horrible person. I text him after the weekend, we fucked up... He disagrees. We haven't spoken much this week until last night. I told him if he wants to be with me, he's home about this completely the wrong way, that he's essentially made me a side girl on the weekends while he returns to be her boyfriend during the week. Ben became very apologetic and distant after this, hopefully because he realizes how incredibly messed up this situation is at this point. He reassures me that everything he's told me about loving me is true, but that he's made a series of mistakes and handled everything very poorly. That's an understatement. 

I don't know what to believe. I feel terrible about this whole situation and now feel like I need to remove myself from it. Sure, I definitely want to be with him, but the way he's handled this is so wrong and shady. It's enough to make me very wary about him just being a cheater. On the other hand, we have a very long and complicated history. He seems convinced that it's a one-off thing. My head and my heart are at odds. 

I guess any insights or personal experiences would be appreciated.

She then said she doesnt think she can't be in a relationship right now. FYI this is long distance because of university. About 500 miles away. 

We had amazing chemistry and she even told me I was the only person she had ever been this comfortable around. She fantasized about our future and it had gone great. But after a week of short texts and little conversation and with that phone call she said that. 

I enquirer further and she stated that she had troubles with commiting to long term relationships and that she needs some time alone. I asked her if she was going to casually date guys anytime soon and she said no. We are still friends and talk quite frequently. She stated that she wanted that right now.

I dated a guy for about a year until we broke it off. I was 21 when we broke up. We didn't contact each other for about a year, then ended up chatting again. I no longer have feelings for him and was not interested in dating but we fooled around and had sex a bunch of times, until about a couple of months ago. 


I broke that off and removed him from social networking a month ago because I felt like things were getting messy. He did the same though he's requested to add me again on Steam.


Today I stumbled upon her Facebook while looking at another friend's page and her profile pic had him in it, so out of curiosity, I clicked it. There were pictures of the two of them going on trips together, on dates, and him playing with her niece and they were all dated through the entire five months we slept together.


I don't know her at all and don't really share any mutual friends with my ex anymore. So I feel like it'd be really out of the blue to message her and also he could play it off as me being a jealous ex. It's weighing on my conscience a bit, but would it be better if I just didn't tell her?

We've had sex a bunch in the last month, he's stayed over once, sometimes we watch movies and cuddle. I made it clear from the beginning I was looking for a casual thing, nothing serious, and he agreed.

The problem is, as these things often go, I have developed feelings for this guy. Which would be fine except I just got out of a long, shitty relationship and don't want a boyfriend for like at least a year, and I don't even know if the feelings are reciprocated.

The way I see it, the only thing to do is put the whole thing to a halt. Reasons being it's not fair to keep fucking someone you have feelings for in a FWB situation, and it's just opening myself up for getting hurt down the road.

My question for you guys is if I should tell him I'm peacing and give him my reasons or if I should just implement the slow fade. The former seems more like an adult thing to do, but opens up the floor for him to tell me about any feelings he might have, which would probably be bad for both of us. The latter option is just a dick move, IMO.

She's the only person whom I've ever really trusted and confided in. She knew that I was crushing on someone and this morning we were texting and I worked up the courage to tell her how I felt, she was shocked but overall reacted positively. She told me she didn't really know what to say at the moment (I guess I did drop a bit of a bomb on her) and that she kinda felt like it was a dream. She, still a little shocked, asked me how I had developed these feelings and I explained how she makes my days better, makes me laugh and feel all warm and fuzzy inside :). She said that she had a big smile and was shaking a little and I said that I was too.
I hadn't slept all night and she was heading to school so we kinda stopped talking for a few hours and when we started talking again she told me about her math test and we talked like usual and were laughing at all kinds of silly stuff. The only mention of the previous convo was when I said that I felt good having told her how I felt and she said that it was good that I shared my emotions.

Now here's my dilemma: I know that she still has some feelings for someone else and I've never been in this kind of situation before so my question is, what do I do?

I had only been dating her for four weeks, and she loved me? I was just waiting for her to send a letter, taking it back. I was in BCT for 77 days, and I received 71 letters from her. No, she never took it back. Then she flew across the country just to see me for a day, and return home the next. 

We were able to talk when I got to my individual job training (18 more weeks) and everyday we grew closer and closer. How could such an amazing girl give up so much for a bum in the army? I wasn't gone forever, since I'm in the Guard, I'll stay home after training. 

Deeply in love, I get home, only to find out that she is the only familiar face I see when I get back. I never had any family, and friends had moved.

Frequent reader, first time poster.

Basically, I used to go out with this girl called Evelynn, which was abbreviated to Eve frequently for obvious reasons. Her name is incredibly relevant to the story, otherwise I wouldn't even mention it.

We were best friends from high school and stayed in our home city for University. I was one of her few friends to stay in touch with her when she went on exchange to Germany in her second year, which probably bought us closer together and meant that we started going out in our 3rd year in University. For a variety of reasons but mostly having to do with us drifting apart and her imminent posting to an overseas post for her job, we (well, she) decided that we had to break up.

Now, I decided to do the whole No Contact thing which I read about in a few blogs when I googled for advice. Decided to block her facebook, twitter and unfollow her on instagram. Deleted her number from my phone and from my Gchat window as well as unfriending her on whatever the google social media thing is. The only thing I still have contact with her through is LinkedIn (which is a necessary professional courtesy)

But I'm finding it impossible to get over her because her name is literally EVErywhere. I see it wherEVEr I go. I EVEn (yes, I actually do see it like that when it's in a word) can't play what used to be my favourite game EVE online because it just triggered me so hard.

I didn't want to break up, I wanted to work through it, but she didn't want to... it sucked, but we live in different states and have had time apart and I've been good; working out, traveling, spending time with friends, getting good grades in my summer classes, etc. We talked on the phone twice since breaking up, and it was shortly after the fact. We were talking like we normally did in the beginning of the relationship (we started as best friends in College). Other than that we haven't really spoken other then 2-3 texts. Things between us seemed good, there was no hatred. However she mentioned that she gets sad about the fact that we ended. 

We started dating early in the school year last year, and she joined in with my group of friends, some of them whom happened to be from the same town she lived in.

Going into this school year, I have all my friends and she has no one. I feel bad because that sucks.  

Now, I know that she wants to still be friends, and when school starts back up, I'm pretty sure she's going to text me to hang out. I still get sad on occasion on how we ended, but I've overall been focusing on myself and have been able to accomplish a lot of things already this summer that I may not have been able to do if I was in this relationship.

My friends ask me about it, and I say that there is no hatred between her and I, and that we might be able to be friends after it all.

One of my friends, who lives in the same town as her, is certain that by the time school starts back up, that she's going to want to get back together, and that I need to steer clear of that.

Our relationship had been rocky to say the least. She is emotionally abusive and had cheated on me multiple times, usually finding some way to lay the blame on me. I stayed with her for so long because I honestly thought that she was a good person who had made mistakes. I have struggled with depression for many years and consequently have very low self esteem. It's so severe that I'm even on disability for Major Depression. I'm currently on a waiting list to see someone about getting on medication to help manage my depression. We're still living together for the time being, until I find a place of my own.

Communication has always been an issue for us. She's always had problems speaking up about sensitive topics. That, coupled with the fact that I was her first serious relationship, have lead to a lot of problems working together to resolve conflict. Now that our relationship has ended, we're at the point of figuring out how to co-parent effectively. My main concern is where the blame will fall when I'm gone. A person who's accustomed to having a scapegoat doesn't suddenly start to take personal responsibility just because they lose their outlet for blame.

Her immediate family is emotionally abusive as well in various ways. Her mother is even an enabler, going so far as to make excuses for her and minimizing her abusive behaviors. So there's a definite family history that I don't want perpetuated through our daughter. She bounces back and forth between apologizing and playing the guilty victim routine, and denying that she's abusive at all.

I've been going out with this guy lately, I like him a lot, I feel he gets me and is very honest and genuine, something I've not truly felt in past relationships.

However, I am now struggling with whether I want to commit to him and solidfy our relationship. Reason being he is shorter than I. I never envisioned myself living a life with a man that was shorter than myself, I grew up like society expects of a man and a woman, a real man, charming handsome dream guy. I'll be quite honest to say that I've always dated men taller than myself, and discounted the guys shorter than me... but it seems these guys keep disappointing. Height mattered to me when I was younger and dating, but as I've grown older, I feel it being of lesser importance now.

So I'm here hoping to find some other ladies out there that have committed and tied the knot with a shorter guy. I really want to feel it out and see how your relationships did/are going. Was it weird? Did it matter? In the long run? Are your children taller than the ''man of the house''?

I adore him and have done everything possible to help him with his depression. Clinics, doctors, meds, insurance, I take care of everything because he has not been able to hold down a job. We live alone in a city in Arizona, we are not from here and have no family here. 

He suffers from Major Depressive Disorder and is prone to anger (non violent) terrible sadness, and extreme social anxiety.  He seems to be turning really irrational as well, and I am at a loss for how to deal with it. 
A few months into our relationship he started smoking Dohka which from my understanding is Iranian tobacco, so much so that the last time I looked at the bank statement and added up how much he was buying it was over $600 in 30 days. It’s literally the only thing that keeps him calm so anytime he’s without it he will rage. 

 We’re on my income alone, I make decent money but with me paying for all of our bills, his medical expenses and taking care of my daughter…I end up having to ask the neighbors in our apt complex for food. This then upsets my boyfriend who says people think we are charity cases now and to keep our business between us. Everything I own of any value is in pawn and when I even try to get him to cut back he verbally attacks me, accuses me of only caring about money and goes on a pity party rampage until he gets what he wants.

It’s been so bad I had his family drive up from 2 states away to do an intervention and take him home with them for a while. He manipulated his way out of it and only 3 days later (this morning) threw an epic rage fit when I wouldn’t give him my last $7 because I needed gas. He started accusing me of cheating on him with my very gay hairstylist, called me all kinds of names and threw my keys where I could not find them when I needed to leave for work, then decided he was going to keep the car and drop me off. I’m at my wits end I know he needs to go but he has no one here and no money. 

I don’t know how to get out without him hurting himself or possibly me (even though he has never been violent before) I want to send him home on a bus but don’t have any money until the 20th so I just have to deal with it till then but I’m afraid of what could happen in the meanwhile. We have no $ left for his dohka at all so I know he’s just going to rage all week and I just cant deal with it anymore.

Before this particular summer, I was a straight A student in honors classes, with high moral standards and a clean reputation. I was honest, transparent, modest, and not afraid to be myself. Aside from the troubles that life brings to many people (parents' divorce, deaths in the family, breakups), you could say I had a blessed life. And blessed would have been the word I used, because I had faith in God at the time.

Gary was in advanced placement classes as well, but not for long. While extremely intelligent, he was absent at least once every week... sometimes for weeks at a time. He eventually dropped out and barely got his GED. This didn't faze me, however, because I was under the belief that love conquers all. You see, his shortcomings were manageable (I thought). He just needed the right motivation. I saw potential in him when no one else would.

So we started to date, and the arguments began. And so did college. I had aspirations of becoming a biomedical engineer. I had the scholarships, I got accepted into a wonderful school. But Gary wasn't satisfied. I lived too far away. I wasn't allowed to have a car on campus, so he had to make all the efforts to see me. Eventually, he would take me back home every weekend so that we could spend all day in bed... doing nothing. We lied to our best friends and family members so that we didn't have to see anyone but each other.

It felt like true love, because no one else has been able to get me that well. He felt like a male version of myself. We would finish each others thoughts. But... I noticed that those thoughts began to be extremely negative. I was a sickeningly positive person, but now I was being short, impatient, and impulsive. I was giving into every whim, living in the moment, and shirking all responsibility.

I dropped out of school.

I wanted to hold onto my dreams, and told him that maybe I could go back to school and become a brain surgeon. I loved and was really good at biology and illustration, so I figured I could combine my dextrous and intellectual abilities. He shot it down immediately, telling me that my dreams were too ambitious. I had never even considered that. To me, nothing was beyond my reach as long as I kept trying. Unfortunately, I applied that logic to love and relationships as well. I knew I could help him realize his own ambitions if I gave him the proper support and encouragement.

Things got tense, though. I went back to school anyway, and while he was supportive, he still blamed me for many shortcomings in our relationship. He was mad? Well, it must've been my fault for provoking him. He never hit me, but I do remember one particular threat. Get away from me, or else I might just hit you. He told me of past relationships, when he actually threw a dish at one girlfriend.

I broke up with him, and he convinced me that we should get back together. This happened many times. He always came crawling back with believable apologies and promises to change. He never changed.

But I did.

I could go on and on about how things got worse. How he took advantage of my father, still owes him over $800, and completely wrecked my childhood bedroom. He not only smoked (many things) in it, but had a threesome with a minor and a married woman. He didn't clean up after himself. He kept his abused cat locked up in that room. When the house was foreclosed, my last memories of where I spent almost my entire life was of the pig sty he had made it to be.

It's so obvious now. It's so very clear that he's a terrible person. Many people warned me of this back in 2008. But I wanted to be the one that was different. I wanted to believe in him. I lost almost all of my friends because of this. The ones that stuck around did so because they were being manipulated by him too. And to this day, they have chosen him over me. They still decide to live and hang out with him, as if he has done nothing.

This invalidates my feelings. This makes me feel as if it is all my fault. Like I'm the bitch with all these emotional issues, and just took him too seriously. Were they really my friends? Are they now? No. Almost no one is anymore.

Now I am a shell of my former self. I have dealt with clinical depression before. My mother and grandmother have had it since they were adolescent. But I always had my confidence. Even if I was sad, I had a path to be on.

But I did so many horrible things with Gary. I hate myself. He would say, We're soul mates, we're meant to be together whether we want it or not. When I ended it for good, he said, Yeah, I know I'm a snake. He knows. HE KNOWS. And I still feel like it's all my fault. I know I'm not supposed to.

Today, I'm attending graduate school. I'm no longer in the sciences, but in liberal arts. I feel like I've wasted these past 6 years. I'm nowhere near where I wanted to be, and all I have to show for it is a shitty degree, a load of debt, a lack of friends, and an emptiness that I fill with substances, food, and media.

I should add that I am currently in a very loving relationship. This man is the exact opposite. He respects me, himself, and our goals. But I just don't feel like I deserve it. I lose myself in fantasies every morning and night. I'm still shirking my responsibilities. 

Before, I had will. I had drive. I had passion. But Gary took all of that away. Where there's a will, there's a way, right? But without will... I just give up at every fork in the road. I take the path of least resistance. I'm weak.

All I want to do is be my old self again. I want that confidence. I make a fool out of myself every day at work and in my classes, because I can't focus. I'm socially awkward when I wasn't before. I know exactly how it feels to know who you are, where you're going, and what to do. But now I'm lost.

It's been two years since I've even seen him. I've been wallowing in these feelings for even longer than that. Why can't I get over it? Why do I keep reliving this in my head? I took full responsibility for all of the bad things that I did while with Gary, and it isn't enough. I don't know how to forgive myself and move on. I try every single day to have a new perspective, and a positive outlook. And while sometimes it works... I always fall again.

Where am I...?

My now ex-girlfriend and I were together for just shy of 4 years; we started going out when she was 17 and I was 19. We have always had a wonderful relationship, she has always been a loving, mature, exciting, warm and friendly person. I was her first kiss and boyfriend. She was my second real girlfriend (but to date my most serious and longest relationship). 

During the course of our time together we went through some pretty heavy shit together, stuff that I don't expect many girls her age would have stuck around for. For example, she dealt with some conflicts with my very borderline personality mother, she literally saw my grandfather die (a big deal for someone who had never seen someone so sick let alone a person take their last breath), she stuck by me with my anxiety issues and most importantly she was instrumental in helping me reconnect with my father who I hadn't seen for 15 years. 

Likewise, I pushed her to get out of the job she was hating, helped her with some serious friend problems and encouraged her to persue her dream of getting into modelling. I took her to New York and Dubai and we got to experience some amazing times together.

We were set to go to England with my dad and step mum and her 21st was coming up after that. 1.5 weeks before we were set to leave, she very abruptly broke up with me. She said she had developed a crush on a guy we both know and she felt really guilty about it. She had also developed doubts about our relationship: she was worried we would drift apart and she also felt that she had grown so much as a person while we were together and she wants to know who she is and that she can stand on her own two feet. She also worried that her modelling would take her out of our city and she didn't want that to impact me (despite me never putting any boundaries on her).

Admittedly I have felt that we had met each other too early - our relationship was so wonderful for people so young. She has said that she still wants me in her life.

My issue is that 2 months after she has broken up with me, I have been unable to stop thinking about her. I miss her so much and I still love her. All I want to do is tell her how much I love and miss her, but at the same time I need to respect her decision and not try to change her mind - I don't want someone to be with me unless they want to be with me.

My current husband was a rebound... a good looking rebound that I quickly moved in with and married the first time he asked me. 

I had every intention of being with him forever, but, I was young, and so much stuff has changed. We have differences we'd never even considered before getting married (do we want kids, house, where should we live, major stuff) and I feel like I'm sacrificing my goals and what I want just to stay with him. 

I also cannot forgive him for saying certain things to me. He is admittedly verbally abusive. For this, I do have resent and anger. 

Lastly, only recently have I discovered how turned on I am by someone who is intellectual. People always tell me I'm smart but I never listen. Now I'm finding that when I have intellectually stimulating conversations with other men, I feel guilty and wished I was getting that from my husband. 

I have told him all of this. All of it. 
Now, one of his friends who has a history of dating married women, has just moved back into town. We really get along. He has a Master's and has so much cool stuff to share and teach me. I have not crossed any lines with him but i know I want to and that makes me sad.

We were very happy, everything seemed just working out perfectly, it started naturally and everything felt just right. We both are in professional school and despite the stress we somehow made it work. I knew at the beginning that he was supposed to leave for 10 months after graduation and we agreed to wait and see if we are going to do long distance once time comes.

However, recently I noticed he was acting distant and cold, and kind of annoyed with me. Anyway, yesterday he barely kissed me good night and was very cold (I have pretty sarcastic side but he seemed to like it, however yesterday he was annoyed and offended by my jokes, but I was just joking) so I talked to him today. He is going to be away for 4 days and I asked whether he needs some space so I won't text him. He said that he has been stressed lately and needs space for the weekend. 

I told him that he can take his time and I am there for him if he needs me, I was just worried for him. He thanked me and that was it.

I am so hurt and confused. I don't know if this is a pre-breakup step and that uncertainty is killing me. I am going no contact and I guess my question is what does wanting space implies? Have you guys ever done that without having a break up in mind? Should I consider our relationship over?

22927,Dating,1pvewo,"I am currently studying abroad in Japan and have been making a lot of new friends. I've never had a girlfriend, but thought I would finally begin taking some bold new steps in that direction while I am here. However, after successfully asking a girl out and getting a yes, I'm having doubts.

The issue is that I'm not sure if the doubts are legitimate or not, so I'm not sure if I should actually back out. To explain in more detail, I'm only going to be here for a year, and there's no way any relationship could survive when I move back home. Thus, any relationship I start here is doomed to fail. In addition, if I get a girlfriend while I'm here, I'll lose a lot of freedom to roam and instead be spending most of my time focused on one person. That seems like a waste of this opportunity.

The problem is that I also know that there will always be a reason NOT to do something, so I'm not sure if this is just me trying to avoid something new and awkward. I've done it hundreds of times before in my life, and I'm trying to get over it.

I have a date of sorts set for tomorrow afternoon and I'm not sure what I should do. I'm considering playing it off as not being a date and asking the girl if we should invite some other people. Alternatively, I could go on the date without intending to make any real moves, enjoy the practice, and then friendzone myself so that I can enjoy my time here more freely.

I realize that there is no right answer to this problem, but I would really appreciate some opinions.

We kissed on the third date but that's as far as we've gotten. I do know we both stopped using CMB, but we haven't talked about exclusiveness apart from that and we aren't officially anything more than dating.

We both have busy schedules and I travel for work, so we only see each other once a week at most, but we chat often thought texts/FB. Lately she took a trip abroad after finals, so we didn't meet up for the last 3 weeks. The casual coffee date we had before that, she kissed me goodbye.

We've been talking on FB while she's been abroad and up to yesterday we were both excited for a date I had set up. I spent a lot of time making reservations, preparing her flowers, and making sure I could take the night off work (there were special work activities that night) to make myself available.

That morning she texted me she wasn't feeling well and we should reschedule to 12/26 night. I agreed amicably, since that was okay, and we video conferenced later that night.

But then when we talked I found out she felt better after a nap before our date, got dinner with a friend, then decided to work on project work. And instead of Next Fri night, it sounds like she just wants lunch, and has been signaling more she'll have to check her schedule if we wanting spend more time than that together (she's done this before though, and has made time to see me). I know she's busy but I'm at the point where I feel like I'm not willing to invest more into us since I feel like she isn't either.

22931,Breakups,22fomm,"We were together for 2 years. I was happy, she was happy, we had a really great relationship. We had one cloud over our head and its that I wanted to live in city A while she wanted to live in city B. I broke it off with her thinking I could never be happy in city B. That was the main reason. I still loved her, she still loved me. We just had this location problem that was making our relationship hard.

Its now been a little over a year since we had a very nasty breakup (we were living together, she wanted me to pay my half of the lease, I didnt want to, it was messy). Over the last year I have realized she was the best thing to ever happen to me. And that she was right, I needed to put her first and make a home with her, and not in the city I wanted to live in. I also realized I actually liked city B, I was just immature and let that affect our relationship instead of working to better it. 

So here I am a year later, living in city A, shes still in B. We have had absolutely no contact in the last 12 months (I did have to send her an email (tax related) and she did not even acknowledge receiving it). I dont know what she has been doing or what her status is. Im pretty sure she hates my guts. Its a shot in the dark, but I figure if she is at least open to talking about it, then why not try? Am I being nuts? Is this embarrassing? Is this too desperate? Will this just open up old wounds that I caused her? I have moved on (well at least initially) but I cant help but think about how happy we were, how perfect we were (outside of this one difference), and that if Im willing to be the person she wanted me to be, then why not see if she wants to talk about it?

Email that I have written:

*Im sure your reaction to seeing an email from me is why the hell is this asshole trying to involve me in his life. But if there is even a small chance that you are willing to read, then please do. Its a wall of text, and I don’t mean to upset you, but I just felt why not give it a shot.* 

*You don’t owe me anything, and I don’t expect you to give me anything. Not even a response. And I know you told me to never ever try to communicate with you, but I just felt like I should reach out to you. I figured why not, the worst you could do is not respond, have a good laugh, and be embarrassed for me. What I did to you was evil. I realized that shortly after I had ended it. It was driven by anger, sadness, and desperation. You never did anything that was deserving of that. I was the one that burnt the bridge. I’m sorry. I know that words can’t make up the wounds that I may have caused. But it was all my fault. You deserve only the best in a man, and I hope that you do find true happiness.*

*Since then, I have realized that at our best, I was the happiest I had ever been. ever. You were my best friend. Better than any other friend I ever had. I realized that when we weren’t in a relationship with an ultimatum hanging over us, things were awesome. And that I was happy. I now truly understand what you meant when you said you thought I would always put my family before you. That when I matured as a man, I would put you first. That home is wherever you make it. At the time, I didn’t understand the concept. Be it immaturity, selfishness and/or stubbornness, I thought that I was putting you first. I wasn’t. But I now understand what you wanted me to do. So that brings me to the point of this email. If you are willing to talk about trying again, just talk, then I am too. This time with no ultimatums. We would do city B and only B. Or C. Or D. Or E (with a couple years heads up). No A (unless you wanted to). Wherever is best for us, not me. No ultimatum, just us. I finally understand what you were telling me all along: home is where you make it. I know this isn’t the only thing you would want, but its a serious start.*

*I realize that this is probably a year late and a dollar short. And that chances are you are in a happier and committed relationship. We were in a two year relationship and we have already been apart more than half of that. So why now? Well, I realized a few things. You were right. About everything. You knew what I have learned over the last year. You were great and I was happy. And after facing these truths for more than a few months I decided to give it a shot. To try to resurrect something great. Like I said, Im really not expecting anything, but this is a you never know unless you try type thing. Kind of like when we first met, and I told you I wanted to kiss you, to which you asked me to leave your apartment. Only to tell me the next day that if I wanted something, I should go for it. If you say thanks but no thanks, Ill go on tomorrow, just as I have, living with my mistake. If you say OK, lets have a discussion, well then, an unexpected step one on a long road. It would be a challenge, theres no doubt about that. Maybe you’re like me, thinking that if there is a chance, no matter how slim, why not give it just a little consideration. It could result in wasted thoughts or maybe something bigger.*

*It is also about timing. The deadline for the city B state licensing exam is coming up, and I would need to sign up. I will also be in B this weekend for a charity event. If you wanted to gauge how serious I am then we could meet for coffee. I know what happened last time I said we should meet for coffee and Im fully expecting a similar response. But I figure why not try.*

*I know any response from you could range anywhere from “is this idiot joking, does he actually think I would ever talk to him again” to “ill listen to what he has to say”. Probably the former, but maybe the latter. Of course, even if you do respond, it would be just to talk. I wouldn’t expect anything else of you. And Im sure there would be a lot of convincing. Why would you trust me again? Why would you forgive me? How is it going to be different this time? Men are a dime a dozen, but maybe our fates are intertwined. Or maybe not. Maybe we’re too far gone. Maybe you didn’t find me that great to begin with. Maybe you found someone better. Maybe its impossible for you to forgive me. Im not looking for your pity. No need to tell me to get over it and move on. This is really an honest inquiry. It is really more out of excitement about what was and what possibly could be, than desperation. I have made a lot of mistakes and I know that they are my mistakes and i have to live with them. But, I figure if there is a chance to fix it, then why not try.*

*I guess all I can hope for is that I have piqued your interest, and you are just thinking “why not?” It could be a yes, a no, or a fine, make your case and ill consider considering it. I only want to start a conversation if you want to.*

Since both are typically highly extroverted and extremely verbose people, I was a bit put-off.

About a month ago my Long Distance SO of about 2.5 years and I broke up. I've been in love with her since...I can't remember. We met through her brother while we were in High School and hit it off really well. She went off to college out of state, I stayed in State but we didn't talk much. we did, however, have extreme crushes on each other that never went out. She came home after not doing so well in school and we decided to try dating and it was incredible.

Unfortunately, She was sort of conscripted to go to school overseas, in...a very large, populous sub-continent. We decided to stay together, and try and make it work. And work it did for two years, until recently. Her situation there is rough, no room to relax, extremely strict overseers, no personal independence (Something she cherishes) and an extremely long, slogging school schedule. Pair that with seeming lack of support from her parents here and there is no wonder that girl hasn't succumbed to some form of extreme drug abuse. 

Anyways, we'd have fights occasionally but nothing that would break us. Unfortunately, I let my own insecurities take over and, in July, began to get a bit paranoid as she became more and more distant. A few fights came up and, before long, we decided to take a break..then end it. 

Now, to the present. It's been two weeks since we last talked. We went over a number of things and apologized and it went really well. We both agree that we still have feelings for each other and that we want to see each other when she comes home. What gets tricky, for me to see, is that she still wants to talk and chat, text and hang out...but wants it to be okay for us to see other people. She was originally promised to come home AT LEAST twice a year for a period of a few weeks at a time. In the past 2.5 she's been home twice. She doesn't graduate until 2017. 

I don't really know how to handle this. I've, essentially, cut all contact with her. Removed her from facebook/skype etc. She isn't actively dating anyone, or even looking (Her school/life schedule doesn't really permit any form of fun) but It would hurt me too much to see her dating someone else. She, on the other hand, still really wants us to be friends and maintain a relationship and, when she comes home, try again. I'm all for that...but I can't really just move on in a pragmatic nature as she has. She knows that maintaining LD is just too hard. She doesn't want any animosity ruining our future, because of a dumb situation now. THat's really cool! I am bullheaded and can't just...separate myself away from my feelings. 

It would kill me to see her with someone else. Even worse, when I told her as such she said she felt, Obligated not to date anyone or go have fun because it would risk losing me in her life. I don't know how to respond to that as I'm just being honest. I'm not over her and I can't just say, Okay, let's date other people but still be besties. when I know we can be so much more and I know how well we work together as a couple and I know my feelings. Also, more so, what's to say that she DOES start talking to someone and she has to describe the nature of our relationship to her new , hypothetical boyfriend. Yes, I love him, I think he's sexually attractive, I would go out of my way to see him etc. It would hurt exponentially more to hear, My boyfriend doesn't feel comfortable with us talking. Sorry.

I don't really know how to handle the situation. I haven't spoken to her in two weeks and don't know what to do. I miss her in incredible amounts and just want her to be happy. I understand her reasoning but I know that I can't see her as 'just a friend', she'll always be something more to me.

tl;dr LDSO and I broke it off after 2.5 years. We cleaned up our feelings and I've gone NC but she wants us to remain friends, talk and chat but 'live our lives' until she comes home wherein we may be able to start dating again.

I am so serious about her and committed to delivering her the best rest of her life.

However, in this instance, I'm intimidated to ask her out on a date. She's younger than me, I'm shorter than her, and I'm also not the out-of-GQmagazine-type-of-attractive-male...plus, she's caucasian and I'm a white-washed asian. I can't help but worry she will instantly reject me without even looking deeper simply based of this fact that we might outwardly look like a bad match. I can't help but be concerned that she will not even be proud to take me home to her parents even if it worked out between me and her.

What would you ladies say if you were asked out by a shorter guy who isn't as attractive (appearance, but hot body)? Would you even go out on 1 date and give it an honest chance to work?

I practically have no time to spend with my bros, and that's something I really miss doing. She's also quite overprotective, and I practically can't get close to any girl without being grilled. I can barely even hang with my best female friends from high school whom I have no feelings for, without getting words from her. We disagree on a lot more things nowadays and I just realize how different we really are, in the short run I could see myself and herself adjusting to this, but in the long run I don't know if she could mold into my family. Sometimes I just feel held back from not being able to do the things I want to with my friends while I'm still young and not in the working world.

Contrarily, she is really nice and kind when she's not on a frenzy and cares about me and this relationship a lot. She feels that I would mold into her family easily and really doesn't want to lose me. She's sacrificed a lot for me, but I've sacrificed a whole lot on my part as well.

Most of my relationships have always been very non-romanced sexual based relations ( I also would like to say that they are over rated after you've done it so many times.) but hopefully this is the girl that I can have my first serious relation ship with.


I very briefly knew this girl but we were very young at about 5 or 6 when we met. Basic preschool boy girl type of thing ( girls have cuties as we all know:/)and I never paid attention to her and often took a little rascal approach to women at the time. Well about 11 years later we have crossed paths in one of our classes.
After talking to her I'll admit that I've fallen for her in a very basic way. Never would I want to waste my time with a shy girl that was also a virgin. Before if a women wasn't putting out and was never highly social I would always shove them aside.
However, this girl has brought out a softer side in me. I don't exhibit hyper sexuality around her and I'm very warm towards her. This is the first time a girl has been able to calm the beast within so to speak without the use of sex but instead from a heart of gold.


We sometimes cuddle when we are outside our school which consist of us hugging for a long period of time with her head laying against my chest and I think it's the most adorable thing ever.


What concerns me is that she doesn't exhibit this cute cuddly nature some days and instead acts like there is nothing between us. Even when we do get close she refuses to take a step back and look in my eyes.


I also hate to admit that I know very little about her which I'm sure can be fixed and is most likely a result in me doing something wrong. I'm not sure what kind of advice I'm looking for. I guess the question is somewhere along the lines of How do I get this girl to open up to me and do these mixed signals mean that shes using me for attention or does she genuinely like me?

His excuse for this was that he had no other close friends at school (we go to college in different states) and he was extremely depressed.

Me and my boyfriend met online 5 years ago, we were okay friends but didn't start dating until about a year ago. We live in different countries but have met each other on 4 occasions, twice before we started dating and then a total of 5 weeks on three separate visits.


For awhile now we have talked about moving in together,  my dream has been to move to England for a long time now and this is a great opportunity since I‘m planning on going to Uni there next year but would like to have lived there and worked a bit beforehand.  
We started seriously talking about this and decided on a town we want to live in close to his best friend and his girlfriend. 
I work part time so I don‘t make a lot of money but I've been putting aside and x amount of money each month to save up for a deposit, a few months in rent until I get a job and some basic stuff we‘d need and I asked him to do the same. 


He had what seemed like a solid job for awhile and I‘d update him on how much money I managed to put into the account and stuff because I thought of that money as ours, it was our investment in a future we would have. When I went to visit him last time, he got made redundant at his job and his landlord turned into a raging psycho bitch (but that's a different story).
 I  told him that until he‘d get another job he could dip into his part of the savings to get by, this is where he dropped a little bomb on me...he hasn't been saving up!!  His idea of „savings“ was the deposit he had on his current place which he would get back when moving out...a total of 350 pounds which is not nearly enough! 


He gets paid a lot more than me, hasn't been paying that much rent each month and or food and when asked he can‘t even tell me where the rest of the money went too! I would understand if it was important. I got really mad/upset because he failed to mention he wasn't putting away money like I was struggling too, I was barely scraping by on money each month because of my low pay but still managed to save up about a thousand pounds in 4 or 5 months.  I was stressing because we had a certain month we were planning on moving out and his money wasn't even enough for half the deposit on a new place in the budget we were looking.


After this I got home and got really stressed, I got paid little the month I got home because I took time off to go visit him and we had agreed that he would pay the deposit on the new place because I had to send a lot of my stuff via ship to the UK which was going to cost a lot and then after that the rent would be split evenly. Now he can‘t even do that and he just recently got a new job but isn't getting nearly enough hours to get any money to save up.


This is stressing me out a lot and I've noticed that I get really short with him. I know its not really his fault and he feels bad but I just don‘t get how he didn't realise that we‘d need a lot of money to start out! There's a lot of basic stuff to buy for the kitchen and other things because neither of us has much of anything to bring with us except our computers, a bed and a tv. Also I can‘t start looking for a job there until I get a NI number which I can‘t apply for until I actually move to the UK so I might not get a job right away although I will look everywhere and take what I can get so I will have to have my part of the rent saved up for at least a few months just in case.


I just feel like I've been putting all the work into this and he hasn't and it‘s making me seriously doubt our decision. It breaks my heart because I want to move out so badly but I don‘t know if it works.  What‘s even worse is that when we Skype now, all he does just gets on my nerves! I‘m noticing things he does that just irritate me and frustrate me so we've been fighting a bit recently but when we‘re together I‘m head over heels in love with him but it‘s different visiting for a few weeks and living together, sharing a space together. He can get a bit clingy and I really need my space sometimes and just be able to be left alone for a bit. 


I just don‘t know what to do, am I making a mistake or should I just suck it up and see how it goes?

I made her laugh, she made me laugh. The sex was fantastic. i got to know the way her legs would twitch when she was falling asleep. She could tell my farts from hers. Sometimes I let her down; sometimes she talked over me. I'd procrastinate, she'd get frustrated with me. We'd fight; we'd make up. I was her best friend and she was mine.

She's the one who helped push me to find this new job. I'm going nowhere in her town and slipping further and further into debt. The new job pays well, is in a new and interesting field for me, and is a great opportunity with lots of room to advance. She'd cuss me out if I didn't take it.

22979,Breakups,1puaef,"I had been in a relationship with a girl for five years. I met her in one of my classes in the first year of university and it just went from there. It was my first out-of-highschool relationship with someone, I was excited because she seemed to be into me. She was into literature, film and television and liked listening to the same kind of music that I play live (Heavy Metal)- at least initially that is how she presented herself. 


A year had passed and within that year she had come over to meet my parents a few times, had come to get togethers I had with my friends and we had gone to a few concerts. We tried to see each other every weekend or before and after our classes together. We tried to meet as regularly as we could. Closing in on our one year, I had joined a band as a guitar player where the lead singer had been a girl. I had been struggling to get a band together that year and was in a musical rut, so this full lineup forged a new spark of creativity in me. Regardless, the girlfriend was not happy. 


Upon telling her the news that I had finally joined a band and who was in it she scowled and told me that she didn't like the fact that I was in a band with a girl. The said girl in question was in fact a lesbian, which I assured her of. I was not interested in other women and take my relationship with the one I'm with very seriously. She was still pissed, apparently I missed the point. She said that she didn't like the fact that I was friends with a girl that could do things that she couldn't: play music. 


I reassured her she had nothing to worry about and that I don't mind that she can't play music or doesn't know as much about it as I do. We had other things in common, such as our love of comic books, art, our love of animals, our wild imaginations, and so on. This went on for a few weeks where she would out of the blue be difficult this way and bring it up again. Then one day I snapped. She was giving me shit about having to have band practice twice in one week because of an upcoming gig and was saying that it was because I just wanted to hang out with the singer, which again, she knew was a lesbian and that I was in no way interested in. 


I brought up the aspects of our relationship that bothered me: 


First: the fact that not once had I been invited over to her house to meet her parents, even though she had said they were in the process of moving for the year, my mother is a real estate agent. It doesn't take that long and the house wouldn't be in that much disarray to prevent an invitation of a person. 


Second: the fact that she was jealous about my lesbo lead singer showed she didn't trust me. 


Third: I had not once been invited to meet up with her friends whenever she went out with them. I had invited her to events that I was going to with my friends plenty of times, she couldn't be bothered.


Fourth: Getting her to do anything was like pulling teeth. She was literally terrified of everything: taking the bus, trying new food that she hadn't eaten before (she was quite sheltered... she had never had a hamburger, pasta, any form of steak, ribs, chicken wings- I'm Italian! I love my veal and pasta!), coming over, asking someone in my house other than myself for a glass of water, going out at night (in the suburbs!), basically anything that required effort outside of the most minimal interaction with me.


I told her all this and that I anytime I brought any of that up in the year I was with her- politely I might add, she'd quickly snap at me or start crying and nothing would get resolved. Nothing would change, things would just remain the same. She'd be terrified of doing normal things that everyone is capable of doing without fear and she'd prevent herself from seeing me if she had to do something that scared her. I'm not talking going bungee jumping or white water rafting- I'm a bit of a wimp for the extreme stuff too, I'm talking like going out for dinner at a resteraunt in another nearby city, or going to a music store with me to help me pick out a new guitar. Mundane things that nobody in their right mind should be afraid of. 


With that I left her. We had tickets to go see a show in a few weeks so I promised that I'd go to that with her because it was something that I said I'd do with her. Needless to say she was quite upset, but happy that I was willing to remain friends with her. We go to the show and I start to feel bad. I couldn't tell if what I did was the right thing... was I giving up to soon? Should I try harder? Long story short, we start going back out again. 


The next four years were filled with changes for me. I changed my program and go to another school, a college this time, but I don't need to move. I get more into my music and actually get a job as a recording engineer at a recording studio for a bit. Then that tanks and I'm out of a job so I decide to go back to school for something else. I'm in a few other bands during this, I play some bigger venues, meet some industry people and I eventually land a job at a boutique Musical Instrument Store as the Pro Audio guy and Vocal Teacher. All the while going to school with the hopes of getting into Teacher's College or just getting a crappy desk job that I know I'll hate my whole life just so that I can move on with my life with my girlfriend.


Within these four years of changes this is where we stood in our relationship:


1. I still hadn't been invited over to her house, but I had met her parents a few times. We went out to dinner and had gone to movies. They were immigrants from Ukraine and the UAE when they came to Canada. I had somewhat of an idea about that from what my girlfriend had told me, but she mad them seem far less Canadianized than they were. I still hadn't been invited over, her reasons were initially because they were in the process of moving from one apartment to another, then eventually she stopped giving me that excuse and would start crying whenever the few times I had brought it up. She would say that it didn't matter and that I should just be happy with HER. Her parents on the other hand were invited over to my parents place for dinner one night and when my mother pressed them about this, just out of curiousity, they evaded the question themselves saying that they were having issues with their landlord and that they were moving at some point but it fell through. Something involving lawyers and a potential scam. So, I never got invited over and saw her parents very rarely.


2. My parents enjoyed her company so much, or at least I thought they did, that they said that she could crash at our place on the weekends. This was okay since I didn't initially work on the weekends (the studio I was at was stupidly closed on the weekends), but then when I got the job at the Music Store, I had to work Saturdays open to close. 


She would still stay over, but my brothers and parents tell me that she wouldn't do anything while here. She wouldn't leave my room. She wouldn't go downstairs and interact with anyone, wouldn't go get food or a drink. She wouldn't even bother looking at my pet hedgehog which she loved playing with whenever I was in the house. She would apparently just stay in my room and go on the computer and turn my parents and brothers down when they asked her if she wanted some lunch or if she wanted to go out somewhere. 


3. She came to every family function WE had. Birthdays, Christmas, New Years, Easter, Weddings - you name it. Her family was Orthodox Ukrainian and the only family she had was her parents and her grandparents- but her grandparents were in Ukraine. They apparently didn't do anything for their Orthodox holidays so I was never invited to these things. 


4. She never invited me to go meet her friends. There was one instance three years in where I was supposed to meet up with her and a friend but on my way there she calls me and says that her friend doesn't want to meet up with me and is nervous about meeting someone new. 


This friend was supposedly her little asian girly friend that she had known since she was in highschool. Needless to say, no matter what I said it wouldn't change her mind on it, so I wasn't too happy and I didn't meet up with them. I never got invited again. Regardless I invited her to my functions still.


5. She was a lot more comortable with me and was actually quite kind and caring towards me and tried to make an effort to do things, albeit they were little things. She had become a little less scared of things every year but it was still like pulling teeth whenever a new element was introduced, such as going to my cousin's wedding, or going to the breeder to pick out a hedgehog, etc. 


She never learned how to drive so I drove her everywhere. In certain regular cases where she had to take the bus to get somewhere she never bothered to learn how to take a bus from the bus terminal to said locations- even to my house (about a half hour bus drive) if I was at work or couldn't get to her. She would just wait at the bus terminal or go the strip mall nearby and wait hours for me instead of just going to take a bus to my house, where she would be allowed in no problem. 


Not only that, but she had my brothers' and cousins' phone numbers. She wouldn't even bother calling them for a ride! She wouldn't do anything herself. When I got a new car the door was a little bit heavier than my old one, she would get fed up if she couldn't open the door properly and just wait for me to get out of my car and open it for her.


6. She would do these mean things that I occaisonally would call her out on. I'm an amateur baker and am always experimenting with dessert recipies. I learned how to make a dessert she had had in Sweden called a Vaccuum Cleaner or Dammsugare. It's pretty tough to make but I made a ton of them for her on our fourth year anniversary. A few months later she learned how to make them too and instead of saving one for me, she just sends me a picture and then tells me that they are all gone. 


Even when she talked to my friends she wouldn't filter her thoughts. After playing a gig I went to her and some friends at the bar to get our drinks and this guy totally passed out at the bar. One of my friends jokingly said: Damn, I wish I could be as carefree as that guy! and my girlfriend snaps at him and says: Well maybe you should try?. 


Furthermore, we go to one of my work Christmas parties. The only girls that show up are her and one of the other employee's wifes. The owner jokingly says: We should seat the girls together because they'll get bored of us talking about guitars and stuff! Everyone laughs and then in a moment of silence the girlfriend coldly says: I don't like girls. I never did. They piss me off. right infront of everyone, including the employee's wife. I would never get mad at her or embarass her in front of people when she did this, but I would talk to her about it after and she'd just say whatever. There were times where she did this to me and I had snapped back at her but left it at that.


7. We got into a few fights here and there, but by the end of the day I'd make sure that we didn't go to bed mad at each other. A friend of mine made a beautiful speech at my cousin's wedding and that last things he said made me have an epiphany about relationships and fighting. 


He said: It's never worth ending the day mad at each other. What's important is that you love each other and that you can shove your pride, anger, or whatever emotion it is aside and realize that. Do not awake the next day with these negative feelings. End them before the start of the next day and remember your love. Needless to say I was the only one that adhered to that. She would never make an effort to make things better.  


8. The things that we shared in common were strengthened... but then started to slowly wane I think. The love of discussion on interpretation of the arts became one sided. Her opinions were the only ones that were right, mine were not. She no longer wanted to listen to the music I was playing, nor did she want to watch the movies that we both had an interest in. 


It was strong, but the last year things started to weaken. She had a full time job and she hated every moment of it. She was constantly harassed by the people she worked with and felt like an outsider. 


Yet nothing I could say or do would calm her. She would rather be upset and mad at what they said and did to her than realize that it doesn't matter, they aren't her friends and they don't care about her like do. So what they have to say means nothing in the end. 


Furthermore, whenever I asked her what she wanted to do, she would always say I dunno. I could give her a dozen choices and it would always be I dunno. I always had to choose something to do, but she never had any idea of where she wanted to go, what she wanted to do.


That is the summary of the last four years. Now comes the breakup.


About two months ago we get into an argument. I had to work on a presentation for a recording engineering seminar I was doing at the shop for a small group of customers that were interested in pro audio and I was just wrapping up the document. She had gone to the washroom, and whenever she goes to the washroom she would take no word of a lie, an hour. 


No matter where we were. It didn't bother me, but it always pissed off my parents because she would go right when we had to be somewhere important. Anyways, she had gone into the washroom so I saw it as an opportunity to wrap up the document. 


Forty five minutes pass and she comes out and starts talking to me about something. I'm on a roll, and I need to finish down writing my train of thought before I forget so I tell her to just hold on one second and let me finish this before I forget. She keeps talking anyways and I try to listen as I wrap up the presentation. I catch some of what she says, but I didn't absorb it all. I ask her to tell me again because I didn't catch anything and she blows up at me. 


She starts yelling at me and puts on her coat and waits for me downstairs. We were supposed to go to dinner but I honestly didn't feel up to it after that. So I tried talking to her about why she was mad and for her to tell me what was up and she said no and refused to talk to me. After driving for about 20 minutes I tell her I'm just going to drive her home if she is going to be this way because I didn't do anything wrong and I'm trying to figure out what is happening. We make up and go out to dinner.


A week passes and I'm supposed to pick her up at the bus terminal after work as usual. She's been texting me about how shitty a day she is having at work. She then texts me that she can't come today and that she is feeling sick. So I go home. I try calling her but she won't pick up so I figure she must be in the washroom or something. She then texts me back that she wants us to break up because we fight too much, which isn't true. 


We rarely fought. I call her out on it and say that I've put up with her for five years and have tried to make all of the bad things from her end work. I didn't think it would be fair for us to break up for a reason that wasn't true and one that we could work out. She started crying saying that she realized that she was throwing so much away if she ended it and that I was right. I felt like shit though, there was no lead up to this! 


So the next two weeks things are kind of back to normal. She stays over, we go to a movie, we see friends and do our regular stuff. Our one year is coming up after Thanksgiving so I was planning on giving her something special for our five years. She was terrible at making decisions, but I knew she loved farm animals so I was going to take her to this local farm that does weekend events. Stuff like horse back riding, feeding baby goats and selling homemade baked goods. 


I wasn't really sure what I was going to get her, but I thought something like a promise ring would have been great. She was always talking to me about where we were going to live, how many kids we were going to have and liked the idea of getting married to me once I was done school. It was her idea that I went back to school actually, and she assured me that she would wait for me til I was finished. 


Anyways, it's Canadian Thanksgiving weekend and she comes over. For some reason she is in a pissy mood. She comes over and just wants to nap. The next day she wants to watch a movie, but refuses to sit near me, saying that it was uncomfortable. In bed she won't even sleep near me, she instead just puts her back to me. We go to my aunts house for thanksgiving and she sees all my family. 


She's happier there but there is still something off. I ask her calmly in private if everything is okay becauase she seemed kind of upset this weekend about something and she instantly loses her cool and tells me that I'm being paranoid. Later that night I take her home, tell her goodnight and call her when I get home to let her know that I got hom alright. She doesn't really want to talk because she is tired but says that she loves me and goodnight. 


The next day I get an email from her saying that she wants our relationship to end because I'm too paranoid and that I have been and will always be that way. She says that she is a different person now and that she doesn't want to be with me. She doesn't hate me, she just doesn't give a shit about me. She won't respond to my calls or texts. Eventually at 1 in the morning she calls me.


She doesn't talk on the phone just stays quiet. I ask her why she wants it to end, what I did wrong. She says nothing. I ask her does she not want to wait for me to finish school? She says she was fine with waiting. I ask her if she cheated on me, or fell in love with someone else? She says no, she wants to be alone. I ask if I pissed her off, if she thinks we fight too much, and she says no. I ask her if she really thinks I'm paranoid and that I only was checking on her on the weekend because she had been acting funny. 


She says no, she doesn't think so. I ask her why I never met her parents or her friends and she says it's because I didn't really want to meet them and that it was only required for a regular relationship that I did, which was total bullshit. She says all this very monotone and calmly. She has no emotion in her voice and doesn't want to talk. I ask her if she wants to go on a break, she says no. She doesn't want to be friends with me and it has nothing to do with me doing anything wrong, she says she wants to be alone and that I deserve better than her. She says she doesn't want to be my friend either. It ends that way I don't sleep.


A day passes and I don't hear from her in the first time in five years. I send her a text the following day asking her what is going on and she never responds. My birthday passes, and she sends no text message, no email, and doesn't call me. 


Almost a month has past since we broke up and I still don't know why we broke up or what happened. I've been a mess. I've realized that maybe I was too patient with her and that yeah, maybe I should have left her. But I took the good with the bad. My family recently told me that they didn't really like her that much, but that they loved her because I was in love with her. I don't want her back, at least I don't think I do. I can't tell if I hate her or if I still love her. 


I still think about her, hell I have dreams about her. She has done hands down the meanest thing anyone has ever done to me. My circle of friends has dwindled over the years because of her. People she was too scared to meet with or that she offended don't really hang out with me anymore. Every friend that I had that was a girl is no longer my friend because of her insecurities and because of my foolish doting on her. How do you make five years go away over the course of one night in an email? How can you look at yourself in the mirror? 


My mother was able to find out that her family name isn't listed anywhere in the apartment that I've been dropping her off at the past five years. More questions....


I wonder if there was something I did wrong, scenarios run through my head a lot. I try not to think about it but sometimes a memory will pop in and I'll be down. Lately I think I've been better but I've had a few meltdowns and I think it will be a few months before I'm fully okay. I needed to get this off my chest and am looking for advice or counsel.

**tl;dr**: I was in a serious relationship with a girl for five years. She was very difficult at times but I took the good with the bad. She had hurt me many times emotionally in our relationship but things would get better quickly. She left me after five years by sending an email without telling me why and does not want to be my friends. I don't know how to feel or what to think.

22980,Breakups,2h3wo6,"This may be a bit tricky for /r/relationships, since I think 90% of the posts here are from younger couples, and we're a bit older than that. But I hope I'll benefit from the collective wisdom of reddit.
 
We've had a comfortable marriage, with no major fights, and I suppose we've survived our share of life's challenges. Our friends would say we're happily married. We are mostly affectionate, our sex life is OK but not great, and neither has had sex outside the marriage (although neither would mind, anyway). We spend most of our free time together around the house although don’t have a lot of common interests or hobbies. We both work long hours at demanding jobs and have done with occasional breaks for most of our married life.  
 
So far so good, but recently we've had a few incidents that have caused me to think twice about the health of our relationship and communication, and I realize that I can't think of even one time when we've resolved a significant conflict, or set a goal and worked hard to achieve it, or had a dream of something that we both want, maybe differently, negotiated the details, and gone out to make it happen. This applies to parenting (we have quite different ideas here), budgeting, investment, property, employment, relocation, you name it.  I honestly can't think of one case in more than two decades. We've done some of these things, but not together, or it's always been one person's idea that the other has gone along with. We're comfortable, but not well-off, and have been lucky that I've made reasonably good money working my ass off over the last few decades (with some breaks. She has also worked, this is not one-sided at all). 
 
We disagree reasonably often, but often just don't engage at all or one or the other will just disengage from the discussion when it gets tough (then it's typically not spoken about again), so either we'll just not make a decision or we'll take the default option. I am shamed to admit that even though this bugs me, my standard response has been to throw myself into work rather than fight the issue, and she's done something equivalent for whatever reason.  But we never end up changing anything, and I've often felt frustrated and like I can never get any improvement made to the kids or household, or our lives. Although I'm usually the one agitating for change, and can often see issues developing early and try to fix them before they become more pressing, if I'm honest I have had a bad success rate doing this. I usually end up having to bite my tongue when things go wrong later rather than say I told you so, or muttering under my breath about how much better it would have been if we'd done what I suggested.  I can't remember how long it’s been like this, but it's a long time. 

We don’t tend to do many new and exciting things together because we pretty much don’t have any common interests. We'll be empty-nesters within a few years and I find myself wondering what is actually left once the kids are gone. If I'm honest in retrospect this hasn't been great fun even during the past years, it's just been easier to ignore it than fight about things each time, I've just been too tired. However, for various reasons now it feels to me like it's all getting to be too much. It's really bugging me, in fact, and I feel horrible about it. I hate the situation but I also hate myself for contributing to it. I hate the failure we've become. I'm not sleeping well, I'm depressed, angry, confused, you name it.
 
I have recently raised this topic with her, along with the prospect of separating. This has caused a bunch of stress, maybe not surprisingly. Up until now, she has been quite happy in the relationship, and has not had any issues. We've talked it through a few times since but haven't come to any conclusions yet. I still want to understand what it causing this before I commit to a fix it/fuck it decision. She I think just wants a return to normal, but I think that would be dishonest and would just blow up badly if we pretended for a year or so, then lapsed back to apathy. So, fake it until you make it may turn into fake it until you get bored with it, then turn ugly. 
 
I know there is a lot we could do to reinvigorate the relationship and I'm giving that serious consideration, however much I'm honestly too depressed to be all romantic at the moment. It's a battle to be affectionate and communicative. I don't know what I want, but I find myself wondering if we're not just driven by such different things, that maybe a separation is best. The kids are old enough to handle it, separating finances and property would be a mess, but nothing there is a reason not to do it. I don't fancy being the lonely man living in an inner-city bedsit, but maybe a break would give us a chance to develop as individuals again. Maybe we could start again then, maybe we wouldn't. But I think we're suffocating each other in apathy the way we're living now, and it's not healthy. 
 
What say you, reddit? Am I a horrible person for wanting to separate from my wife of 20+ years for reasons of sustained mutual neglect, or should I man up and lie in the bed that I have also partly made?

22983,Infidelity,2ml0xj,"Over the course of this year, I had been talking to a friend who eventually became my girlfriend. She lives across the country and I recently flew out to see her. When I was there everything felt perfect, and real. Even though we had been committed for longer than that, the relationship did not feel real until I was there. I knew I had to change when I got back, and have already made several decisions to change myself and how I treat others, especially those who care about me.

Before I visited her, I made the dumbest mistake of seeing other girls. I had physical contact with a few, and some were just girls I hung out with. My now ex girlfriend had recently discovered a message by accessing my Facebook, between me and another girl, as well as other suspicious messages. She was furious, but was still willing to work things out possibly, and wanted me to visit this December so we could talk things out. Last night, I admitted that I had gone beyond just that message with that girl and was with several other girls. Whom I now I have no contact with or desire to contact. She told me we'd never work out, which was expected. I couldn't live knowing I was always hiding something from her. She told me how sick I was, how violated she felt, and then talked about how happy she'll eventually be with someone else. I know I've made my bed, and now I must lay in it. I'm still seeing my therapist. She doesn't want to talk, but I hope she can one day forgive me.

Now I just have no motivation. She was my motivation, and even though I had a really shitty way of showing it, I did care about her. I just didn't feel the realness of the relationship until I was there with her. I know that doesn't make what I did right, and seems like an excuse. I just wasn't ready for what a LDR entailed, until I was able to see her in person. When I got back home I was motivated and ready to make things work, but I was still living with my secret. I know I deserve to feel this way, but I can't even bring myself to go to my high stress job. I'm not sure where to go from here.

22986,Dating,2fw03s,"We met around two months ago, began hooking up a month ago. When we first began talking, he told me he was 23. Fast forward to now, I was talking to a mutual friend (who has no idea we are FWB, and we intend to keep it that way) and in passing she asked if he had ever shown me pictures of his two kids. I told her I had no idea he even had kids, and she told me that he's actually 27, meaning he initially lied about his age.

Later in the conversation, this mutual friend mentioned that only one of the kids is biologically his, while the other one isn't. Which leads me to wonder if he's actually married. After this conversation I did talk to the FWB, and he swore up and down that he's no longer with the mother's of either of the children. However, I don't know if I should believe him since this wouldn't be the first time he's lied to me.

I'm 30.  I'm a guy.  I'm from the US.  I've had relationships, one or two even on the serious side.  I have a really good job.  I'm a web developer, and I get to travel around a lot.  Australia, China, Hong Kong most recently.  I dig it.

She works where I'm currently working.  I'm only here a month.  We first started talking about work things.  Then we started moving into other areas.  Last night I asked her to dinner and she accepted.  Some of the other workers tried to tag along but she politely rebuffed him.  It made me feel really good.  I tried not to read into things, but I did anyway.

At dinner she mentioned that she lives with her boyfriend of 5 years.  5 years.  *5 years*.  She wasn't sure where it was going.  We kept hanging out anyway.  We finished dinner.  I asked her out for a drink.  She suggested we walk a bit first.  We did.  Then we had a drink.  We had so much in common.  We stayed until it closed.  It wasn't affectionate, it was friendly.  I didn't want to make things uncomfortable.  We left and I walked her to her car.  She left.

So a few days ago my older brother [17 M] had a couple of his girlfriend's friends/his friends over to hangout on Friday night. When I entered the house, my brother was sarcastically going off on this girl because she took a cone off my cat (The ones that prevent the cat from licking their surgical wounds so they won't get infected) when i became aware of what she did, I called her an idiot and told her she almost killed my cat. (I was joking too, that cat was one day away from getting that cone off anyway) 

About 30 seconds later, I left because my brother offered me and my friend free Panda Express if we drove out and got it from him. About an hour later, I dropped my friend off at his house so he could take his car over to my house, and I got back to my house before him. When I got back only his girlfriend was awake, and everyone had left except my bro and his friend. Anyway, I talked to her about unimportant shit until she brought up that the one girl i joking lectured thought I was hot, and wanted my number.

I was thrilled when I heard this, because SHE WAS LIKE, THE HOTTEST GIRL EVER. So anyway, I text her that night and the next day on and off...

While we were texting she asked me if I was going to my brother's girlfriend's party that saturday night. I had no intention of going, and didn't even know that there even was a party going on that night. I had never even been to like, an actually cliched High school party before. I was nervous to say the least, but tempted my brother into taking me with him to the party.

Since my brother worked that evening we were late by about 3 hours, and I was kinda uptight and stressed, I hadn't even had an actual conversation with this girl yet... But, like every cliche high school party, I was given some alcohol and marijuana. After I was intoxicated, I finally got to talk to [17 F] for a bit, and I hit it off pretty well. (She was completely sober btw) Anyway, after a while she took my brother, his gf, and I home after the party (she was STILL completely sober) On the way back, I kind of pestered her while she was driving, but when I repeatedly apologized, she said it was fine, and actually, she thought it was cute (how?) Anyway, Once I got back home she almost immediately had to leave, so I hugged her and was actually able to kiss her before she left.

That night, I had promised to take her on a date, and she accepted, but since then, I've been extremely nervous. Now while I consider myself somewhat attractive, THIS CHICK IS LIKE REALLY HOT, hotter than anyone I had ever dated. And while she is pretty small for her age, and I am pretty big for my age, I feel like this chick is way out of my league. I kinda feel like when I take her out on this date, that it was all a big prank and ill be an embarrassment to society. She also stated that she wasn't a virgin, and once i told her i was, she thought that was cute too...  So reddit, what should I do? Im not nervous about the date at all, (Im actually experienced/confident about that) I am nervous that she will realize that im just some kid, and not as cool as she thinks i am..

Let's call her Olivia. We met fall of 2012, both attending the same college, and hit it off immediately. In the span of 26 months we traveled abroad together more than once, each of us have met the other's family (my family loves her and vice-versa), and we'd talked about having a future together. Not that we didn't have our share of problems, but I can honestly say I have never loved anyone like I loved/love her and I couldn't/can't imagine sharing my life with anyone else.

&amp;nbsp;

Unfortunately, she graduated this past May and I am currently in my final year of school. We'd made a plan that she would work in the major city about 2 hours from where I go to school until I graduated and then we would live together/be married while I served 6 years in the military (starting a month after graduating from college.) I realize writing it down that this sounds one-sided but it was mutually agreed upon and we were both very excited to start this chapter of our lives together. She was fully onboard with this plan we'd made and I never would've agreed to it if she hadn't been. 

&amp;nbsp;

After she graduated in May she had a hard time finding work. The job market is extremely tough and although she had a wealth of experience and excellent grades, the job offers were minimal. After a few months things weren't looking great but we were still keeping our hopes up and she was applying to everything in the tristate area. One day she got finally got a call, for her dream job no less, and immediately accepted the offer. The downside was that it was literally on the other side of the country and she'd accepted without discussing it with me. I told her how proud of her I was but eventually asked her not to take it as it would put us so far apart from each other for an entire year. She said she had to accept because there wasn't any other work and she couldn't pass up this opportunity. However, she agreed to quit upon my graduation from college so that we could continue with the original. We promised to see each other during school breaks/holidays and so she moved and took the job. 

&amp;nbsp;

She started the new job and I started school the same week. We were both extremely busy and due to the 3 hour time difference and her 9-7 work schedule we hardly ever had the opportunity to talk. Skpying every day was cut to maybe twice a week--communication was limited to mainly texting, an occasional phone call. We started fighting. A lot. Mostly about her job and why had she taken it, etc. I really resented her (and her job, the new city, etc.) for putting us in the situation of being apart for so long and she was angry with me for not understanding why she had to be there. We both felt extremely lonely where we were but didn't take much solace in communicating either since all we did was fight. After three months, and multiple plans to see each other falling through on her part, I told her I couldn't do long distance anymore and asked her to quit at the end of the calendar year and move in with me. She told me she couldn't and asked me instead to transfer schools. I told her I wouldn't do that, as I had responsibilities here, and she said the same. After many conversations going this way, we broke up. She didn't want to break up (wanted to make the distance work) but I couldn't do it anymore. 

&amp;nbsp;

We've been broken up for a month and in that time have spoken once, I made a last ditch effort and told her I would visit for Thanksgiving. All she had to do was tell me by X date and I would drop school and work for a week (plus a week long break) to be with her. We could work things out and she would potentially move in with me. After that conversation I didn't hear from her, and thus assumed the answer was no. Since, I've taken all the normal break up steps and we blocked each other on social media, etc. I've been doing a lot of thinking though and I can't shake the feeling that she's really the one for me. I love her and I want to spend my life with her. I had picked out a ring planned on proposing before I graduated because that's how sure I was about things. The happiest moments of my life have been the mornings I've woken up next to her and gotten to make her coffee. It seems so mundane but honestly I feel like I could face anything if I got to do that every day. 

&amp;nbsp;

Finally, and I apologize for how long this is, I'm wondering if I should go to her and repair this. I have a three-week break coming up after finals and am considering flying cross-country to see her and get her back. In my head the distance doesn't seem as unmanageable now since I only have one semester left of school, but I need some outside perspective on if this is a really stupid idea. Should I go or move on?

22999,Dating,1mx7z9,"I have had a crush on a girl almost since junior year, high school, started a few weeks ago.
We were getting along really well. We went out to lunch together, and had great conversations, so I asked her out.
We planned to see a movie together. I had a long distance relationship which I planned to end before the date.
She came over to my house a couple hours before we left for the movie, which we spent on my couch together. I had my arm around her, and
when the time came to leave for the movie showing, she gave me 'the look', which is when I should have kissed her.
Instead, I awkwardly got up and we went to the movie, having a great time. I didn't kiss her because at the time
I was technically still in a long term relationship left over from summer (fbo) that I hadn't ended out of fear
of the breakup talk. I thought that it would be better to wait on making a move on this new girl until I grew a pair
and broke up with the long distance girlfriend, which I later did over video call (we live far away). That breakup, which
took place a few days later, went really smoothly. My now ex said she felt the same way too, which is when I started
beating myself up for not doing it earlier and not kissing my crush.

A combination of fear and not having time alone with my crush prevented me from telling her why I didn't kiss her, and
that I really liked her. Over the next week, during school, we were still very friendly to one another, and we would
smile when we saw each other and got to hang out.

The weekend after I saw the movie with my crush was our school's first dance. This dance is usually characterized by
lots of people dancing and hooking up. I asked and she agreed to meet up prior to the dance (bringing her best
friend) at my house so we could drive to it together. It is worth noting that I almost never went to the dances at
my school, and had almost no experience dancing with girls. Also, dancing in this context is grinding.

Once at the dance we hung out a bit, formed a little circle with some of our mutual friends and we began dancing.
I was awkward as hell, not knowing what to do with my hands, and after about a minute, she went back to being part
of our circle. A little while later, a sophomore (one year bellow both of us) whispers something in her ear,
which leads her to dance and then hook up with him for about the next half hour. This hurt a lot, and I spent the
remainder of the dance hanging out with a guy friend of mine waiting for the dance to end. Probably the worst part
was that I couldn't leave because my crush, who was making out with someone else, was my ride home.

That was friday, two days ago. I would like your advice/interpretation of this situation. I am currently planning
on getting her alone and telling her that I like her, and accepting whatever she says. I have been hurting a lot
and worrying the past two days. I really like her and would love to date her, but I also don't want to destroy
what could be an amazing friendship if she clearly doesn't like me.

And again she insists that we hang out. I knew that she was having a very small get together at her house- the types of things I am never invited to because I don't like them. Still, she demands that I come. Of course, this type of thing always seems like a red flag and a sign of trouble but she just did not want to relent and I didn't want things to get awkward.

I attempt to lie to myself about the things I am feeling for her- and fail miserably.

23013,Breakups,36sel3,"We are seniors in college and graduate in 4 weeks. We dated 6 months. We started out really happy though he was worried because it's senior year, he had 2 relationships in college that didn't work out. He was worried because he has anxiety and depression and has this thing where he wants to make people happy to his own detriment, or that's what he claimed.

We were happy through our spring break trip together, though he is pretty critical - he's a neat freak and would call me dirty or disgusting sometimes even though I'm pretty organized. He also locked me out of his room one time because he didn't like something I said. However, he was also really caring, wouldn't have sex with me once when he thought I was too drunk, told me how much he cared about me and wanted me to be happy and be able to tell him everything I was upset about, planned stuff to do together, etc.

At the beginning of APril, he told me he doesn't see this being long term and that when he goes out he looks at other girls and feels like he's single but still dating someone but doesn't want an open relationship because those hurt people. I agreed in the sense that I'm religious and he's not and he was annoying me during our trip because I noticed at this point that he spends all his free time watching tv (including while at school) and we weren't having the deep conversations I wanted to have.

HE later apologized for hurting my feelings and that it made things weird between us and spent two weeks telling me how much I meant to him and how much he cared about me, wanted to spend time with me, was happy being with me, etc.

But then he got sick with a cold/fever for like 2 weeks and kept complaining about being sick, wanting me to take care of him, asking me to bring stuff over, being depressed, refused o go to the doctor, skipped classes, etc. I was studying for the MCAT and felt really burdened and like I didn't really even have a boyfriend anymore. He kept apologizing for his issues, for being sick, thanking me for taking care of him. I remember him saying I like you more because you take care of me, which was obviously a bad reason and I fel like he wanted a mother.

HE got better, but he snapped at me for not understanding something he said right away on the Monday when he started feeling better since he had misexplained something and said God, it's so hard tp explain things to you! He later apologized for projecting his feelings onto me. We were hapy for another couple of days. Then we went to his friend's birthday party. He drank too much and spent a lot of time with me but also kept touching another girl's back. He said she was cute when we left, and when we were going home (he was kind of drunk and zig zagging), he blamed me for not looking out for him, for letting him drink too much, said I was bad at taking care of people, told me to shut up.

He didn't really apologize other than thanking me for not slapping him for being rude, and when I tried to talk to him about it the next day he apologized but then blamed me for it, saying he was upset because I had supposedly encouraged him to drink to compensate for my not drinking. That wasn't true at all, ane he was blaming me for his actions. He also interrogated me about how i got back from my friend's house that night, where I stopped on the way, why, etc.

I was gone the whole weekend (this happened a Friday night) so we didn't get to spend any time together. I had a bad week the following week because I had my period, midterms, lots of work, was worried about recommendation letters, etc. So I was coming over to his place pretty late (11:30) to sleep. I kind of joked around and laughed with him before bed just to get some relief from the stress.

I didn't let him know i was stressed because he had said before things like We can't both be sad, or told me it upset him that I was worried about getting into med school when I do so much volunteering and he doesn't do as much. He has a low GPA and he's worried about finding jobs, still doesn't have one. He also started making fun for me for not knowing a medical abbreviation and stuff like that during this week. But he was also rolling oer in the night and really tenderly touching me and I was confused.

On Thursday he wanted to get dinner but I couldn't make it since he asked at like 5. Thursday night we were laying in bed and he asked to get dinner Friday. When we got dinner Friday, he told me he didn't think he could be in this relationship anymore, we weren't growing together, the religion thing (I'm religious and he doesn't really think deeply about it), this relationship was stressing him out a lot (he had been saying he wasn't doing well that week, bit his nails way down... actually he usually said he wasn't doing well througout our relationship because he has a bunch of issues IMO) and that was it. He told me to let him know if I wanted to talk.

I haven't reached out to talk, I've noticed from his online activity he's online kind of randomly throughout the night. What Im curious about too is he used to rarely post snap stories but he's posted two since we've broken up that I haven't clicked on/ viewed but I could tell was him taking a walk around campus and another was a video game. Is he maybe reaching out for my attention? (or attention in general, he doesn't have many friends here). He also has issues trusting people but told me he trusts me.

I'm still struggling to make sense of this. On one hand, I agree with him that we're not long term compatible. On the other, I'm realizing how poorly he was treating me and how he seemed like he wanted other girls, and I don't know what to make of that or whether to label him as abusive or whether he was just frustrated with me and taking his frustrations out because he didn't want to be with me. I always thought he end of our relationship would be a discussion and instead he just did this. I'm not sure if it has to do with his control issues or him being kinda depressed and erratic or what. It's also sad that HE broke up with ME after he was being kind of mean and I didn't stand up for myself and I took care of him for a while when he was sick and clingy and whiny.

I keep feeling like I could have been more honest about my feelings or done something differently. I also keep wondering what he's doing, whether he feels freed, wants to enjoy the single life, stuff like that. I know we weren't compatible but we didn't even talk about it and he made a snap decision when we were both stressed (which I guess was easier to cut it off then and he felt in control). Can someone please just help me understand and process this better?

23021,Breakups,2y9zw4,"(Throwaway for obvious reasons)
I (18F) told my SO (20sM) that I have symptoms of genital herpes yesterday. For the past week, I had a lesion on my labia that I thought was just a cut until I broke out in a few bumps and showed all the textbook symptoms of HSV-2 (backache, sharp labial pain, fever, etc.). About a month ago, before my SO and I were exclusive with each other, I hooked up with another guy. He fingered me and went down on me for less than a minute before I felt guilty and told him to stop. 

The morning after, I told my SO about hooking up with the other guy and he was very upset. We had been having unprotected sex exclusively for eight months, but had never established feelings. We still care about each other deeply and he is the closest person to me. I truly regretted it deeply and felt so disgusting about it. 

A month or so after this event, boom. Herpes. In retrospect, I had shown mild symptoms of it a few months ago (a cut that wouldn't heal on my labia) but didn't think anything of it. The lesion was my only symptom. I still don't know if my SO gave it to me or if the guy who went down on me gave it to me. However, considering men can be asymptomatic, I have a suspicion my SO contracted it without knowing before we started having sex.

Yesterday, when I told him, I explained my symptoms via text and asked if we could talk in person. His only reply was god fucking dammit. I really wish I could have told him in person, but I could not wait. My anxiety got the best of me. I thought I would give him some space until this morning. 

This morning, I asked if we could talk in person. He immediately told me that he's suffering the worst possible consequences (an STD) of me hooking up with that guy. He had developed a cold sore on his lip, presumably from going down on me a few days ago before I realized my symptoms. He told me that we could never be friends again once this is figured out and that I should go fuck myself. He told me he was tired of my bullshit and that it's MY fault that we had unprotected sex. I am so heartbroken... I just really need someone to talk about. I feel disgusting and subhuman. I am on the verge of a breakdown. I feel like my world is ending. 

**TL;DR: I contracted genital herpes and my SO is blaming it on a guy that I hooked up with before we exclusively started dating. I was likely infected by my SO who is asymptomatic, considering it is less likely that I contracted it from thirty seconds of oral sex. I'm rather devastated that he is not taking responsibility for this situation and acted out of anger. I just really need someone to talk to, I feel subhuman.**

She's either smiling or making a funny face in all of her pictures, has what looks like a prom dress, and generally looks pretty. Talking to her through text I would have no idea either. She writes like anyone else, and her major is Creative Writing. Personality-wise, and ~75% appearance-wise, she's a normal girl.

But I think she might also have some other form of physical impairment. She doesn't flail her arm or make super loud noises. But her arms are locked straight, and seem to constantly sway around her, like the wacky wavy inflatable arm tube things slowed down. Seeing her in person, her head is always very far down or very far back with her mouth agape. I guess she can pose for pictures but just relaxes around campus? She's a very happy person and laughs a lot, but her laugh is more of a sucking, unable to breathe noise. 

She has a wonderful personality, and if all we ever did was talk to each other over text, everything would be great. But I want a relationship at this point in my life, which means spending time together in public. I would feel *embarrassed* to be with her in public. And that makes me feel awful. I feel like I'm putting myself above her has a human simply because I'm normal. And I don't like that. I don't like that I feel like I'm such a shitty person. But it's true. If we were around campus together or in the mall or something, and she laughed or made a noise or her arms started moving, I would want to leave. I would want to get far away from her so as to be disassociated with her. 

&gt;Well gee OP, how about you get off your high horse and stop being such a fucking shithole?

I had no idea I even felt this way. I want to, but I don't know if I could live like that. I've always tried to live under the radar. My face gets flush, I start sweating profusely, my heart rate skyrockets, and I start to speak really fast when any public attention is brought to me. What if I bring her to a work party? What if my coworkers just look at us and make faces? I can't not care. That's how I work.

23025,Dating,2lle93,"This guy[26/M] and I, we'll call him D, have been friends since elementary school. He was my first real big crush that lasted from elementary all the way to the end of high school when I realized that we just weren't ever going to get together.

A couple of years ago, D ended up meeting a girl in college, getting married, and having a kid. Throughout this process we would talk maybe once every year as just a catch up message or when we'd see each other when he was home from out of state.

A couple of days ago I received a message from D asking me why we never ended up getting together during our childhood years. I thought it was an odd question so I just ignored it. He kept up the conversation asking me general How are you questions but every once in a while would throw in something about our past or how he still has a crush on me.

After digging and interrogation I found out that D separated from his wife 3 months ago. He says he misses her and wants to make it work but for the past two days he's been asking me to come visit him out of state. Saying that he'll pay for the flight and hotel. But I just don't think it's a good idea. I still have my girlish crush on him but I just got out of bad relationship and don't really feel like being used by a guy who's mourning his marriage. I know if I go I will try my hardest to keep it just as a friendship trip, which he says it will be, but I know if he tries something more I'll end up caving in and going for it.

But then again, he keeps telling me that I've been the only person to try and talk him through this process and because of that kindness he really wants to see me and reconnect. And though I know I'm being used I really would enjoy a vacation. Is that selfish of me? Is it wrong of me to be talking to a, technically still, married man? Should I continue to tell him to work on his marriage and if it ends up failing **THEN** we'll hang out? Or should I just go and have a good time?

However, what he said next shocked me, he said that it was my ex-boyfriend he'd been socialising with. Me and Jason live together, have done since September last year.

He admitted they get on *really* well, have a bit of ho-yay together, bro time, and said they're great friends. However, they spend so much time together, that I get ignored, and he often leaves plans to dp things with me until last minute, and it's caused conflict in our relationship. Chores even get left out so he can be with Steve.

Don't want to sound like the paranoid girlfriend here, but how often do you think they'd be comparing notes on me, e.g. who was better in bed etc., what were my bitchiest moments, when did she PMS etc.? Although, saying that, I did see an email on my computer to Steve asking him for his worst moments with me involving me PMS'ing like Katy Perry, bitchy like Katy.

Kinda ironic, 'coz I look like a thinner Meghan Trainor, not Katy Perry.

Me and Steve broke up 4 years ago, not due to cheating or anything sinister, but because he wanted to travel in South America and the Caribbean, which I couldn't afford - he returned from his travels around late 2012. Steve said he loved me, but more of a friendzone way than a girlfriend.

I'm finding the whole thing a little bit weird. I mean, if I spent loads of time with one of Jason's ex-girlfriends, and we compared notes on his dick, who he was better in bed with etc., wouldn't he hit the roof?

Looking for advice on this here, was he good to be open and honest about it, or is this odd?

23032,Dating,1nfaqx,"So, my ex-girlfriend of about four years broke it off with me this past May.  It took a while to get over her but I eventually started going out with other girls around the beginning of July.  I was attracted to these girls but I never felt the connection I had with my ex.  I suppose I may have been expecting too much for only knowing the girls for a couple weeks.  Regardless, I soon lost interest in the few girls I hung out with over the course of summer break. Then this semester of College started.


---


This is the first year of living off campus in this type of Student-Only type of community.  It is about twenty houses or so of four roommates to a house.  We started heading out a week or so into living at our new house and I met this girl who lives across the street.  I was instantly attracted to her; I didn't even remember the names of any of her roommates after she introduced herself.  Normally, (and not to be a big cocky asshole) I am not that nervous around girls.  It has never happened to me, but this girl seems something special to me and I felt the feeling I had with my ex, which is why I am working so hard for it to happen...


----


So we started hanging out with our houses together.  She lives with two other girls and a guy, while my house is all guys.  They came over the night we met them to drink a little and hangout.  I guess you could say I tried to get to know her better but I was incredibly nervous for some reason....it was just irregular for me.  About a week or so after getting to know her, we went over her house and she gave the most amazing back massage to me that I have ever gotten.  I don't really need to go into detail, but I took that as a sign that she was interested.  We were pong partners that night, and we really got to know each other that night.  I ended up staying up until 7am with her just to talk and get to know each other.  She gave me this two minute hug before I left, even keeping me in as I tried to push away and I figured that was the best sign to get if I ever were to get one, so I asked her out to dinner.  She said ,Now is not a good time..  And that just confused the hell out of me, and in my head that was her saying no politely.  This was the first week of September.

----

Move forward a few weeks and we still hangout a lot.  I hangout with her guy roommate a lot, so I see her almost every day.  Because I see her roommate so often, I have learned a little about her.  Apparently she has had a few (for a lack of a better term) fuck-buddies and she has become attached to her most recent one.  Now I assumed this was the reason why now isn't a good time for her, obviously she is already interested in someone else.  I was a little pushed back, but I mean that doesn't mean I don't have a chance.  When we do hangout, I'll have homework to do and she will try to keep me over, like push me back down on the couch if I try to get up, or she'll put her legs up, just overall flirty things like that.  My roommates will be there too sometimes, but she doesn't do those same things with them.  Just the other night she sat on my lap for the first time as well, and tonight we were playing a card game and she began tickling me, tapping me, pushing me, that type of deal. So, this is where you come in my fellow Redditors.

23037,Dating,1yugxz,"Hello,
I have been stressing out about this for a good 2 weeks now over various things. Lately, and the one I am actually stuck on is this:

I have started dating(we aren't dating, but we are not exactly friends either, we have been seeing each other for approximately 2 months) a Chinese lady who is living in Canada for schooling with plans to immigrate here. She currently lives in a rooming house with a couple, a single lady, and a male room-mate(gay). My feelings for this lady are really strong for her (I am in love with her).

Last night me, her and the male room-mate went out to a party and returned. The Chinese lady was fairly drunk while we were mostly sober. Me and the room-mate talked and I don't know how we got onto it, but we talked about what she wanted, etc, etc, etc.

He brought up that she was most likely in conflict because: 1) As a girl, her heart is telling her to find true love, her prince charming 2) As a traditional chinese lady, her mind is telling her to find someone who is able to support her and her daughter.

His comment to me was You don't have a house for her and her daughter to live in, you live with your sister. Honestly, I am not in the best circumstance right now because I am still paying rent at a place I had with my ex. I am full-time employed making double minimum wage where I live and I am working on developing a side business as well(programming), so I am not a bum. We aren't even at the point to discuss something like living together (she wants me to meet her daughter first it seems before anything happens. I hope my daughter likes you, and she has even gone so far as suggest that I help pick a English name for her. She seems to have changed her original plans from her daughter coming in September to coming in April if she can, I am not sure if that is so I can meet her earlier or if she just misses her daughter terribly, or a combination of both).

The other side of it is, I know her previous marriage was based on love, not money (she went back to China to marry her first love) and even though she is traditional Chinese, I am not sure if the monetary issue is as huge of a issue as the room-mate is making it out to be.

I am feeling a little lost because of the feelings I have for her versus her culture. I am also conflicted in that while I love her, and I know I will love her daughter, it might not be what is best for her &amp; her daughter.

I am kind of lost and done know what to do at all with this whole situation.

23045,Infidelity,2owpe4,"So basically i know im going to get alot of hate from this post but whatever i don't care. I just wanna get something off my chest and i would also like to get some advise.

So basically this was a girl i was going out with for my junior, senior years and halfway through the first year of college. She went to college after we graduated in 2012 . I found out the beginning of my senior year she was going to Arizona and i started cheating on her out of my own stupidity and immaturity . Call it whatever. I think the actual number was around 19 girls total (that i had sex with).
Multiple times with a lot of them and a couple one night stand type of stuff.

So anyways basically i hated myself for it the whole time i was doing it but i couldn't stop doing it. I couldn't bring myself to tell her either. Some girls didn't care i had a girlfriend and some did and would tell her but i would convince her otherwise that nothing was going on numerous times. 

So what troubles me now is that i cannot get her out of my head and its been 2 years later. i have a new girlfriend that im totally loyal too and absolutely nuts about (dating for 1 year) but i cannot freakin get my ex out of my head. I still have like some emotions as i have not seen her since we broke up. we broke up in april about two years ago but i have only seen her once in june (same year) when she got back from college in arizona and that was so she could give me all my shit back. 


Basically what im saying is. i know i loved her. I should be over her by now or at least not have random memories when im with said new girlfriend but they do come up and it bugs me, Because i love my new girl. I don't know what to do and im sure ill get alot of hate from this post but i just want to know what to do. I was a horrible person and when we broke up it did really kill me, (i tried to commit suicide 2x) and especially since i know she really didn't expect anything like that and the last thing i wanted was to hurt her. I still have the need to like facebook stalk her and see how she is. and i cant stop. it really bugs me. 

Sometimes i think about her and all the good times we had. She still doesn't know that ive had sex with about 20 girls. she only knows of like 2 or 1 i think. she won't talk to me in person and obviously wants nothing to do with me (i dont blame her).

but for the sake of my new relationship i really like this girl and i dont want to fuck things up by having stupid thoughts or emotions i dont need. Especially from the past. ive completely changed the person i am and honestly her dumping me realize what kind of destructive path and shitty person i was. So i take that as a positive from all this but i still don't know why i feel this way or why i have this need. I just want to get her out of my head and move on. I have only told my best friends about how many girls i fucked when i was with her.
No one else knows. Not even my new girlfriend. She knows i cheated on her but i told her it was like 3 girls.


Sometimes i sit in my room and just think about everything that happened and what could have made it easier on both of us.

23047,Dating,2m54so,"Background: I'm a junior in high school, and I've been dating a boy, Lucas, for the past year or so now. We aren't very physical and our only intimacy includes quick pecks, occasional making out. I really liked him for his personality, but I think now we really are like close friends more than anything.

Before I started dating Lucas, I always thought this other guy (Mark) liked me (or maybe was just physically attracted?). He never said anything, but I kind of felt that vibe. Sometimes when I was talking to him, I would see him looking between my eyes and my breasts/legs. I never really said anything because it would be weird to bring up, and he could've just been zoning out.

When I started dating Lucas, Mark seemed kind of upset. I never asked him about it, though since I just thought it would be weird. Recently though I've been spending more time with Mark because I am in the school marching band and he plays football, so I'd always have to go to his games and we would carpool home together.
Current situation: I mean, I've obviously been horny before because of hormones, but I've never had a guy do something in particular that would cause these emotions. Usually it would just be at home because of explicit scenes in movies or at school randomly, but never because a guy did something in particular.

Mark touches me a lot in a friendly way. He's a pretty charismatic guy so he's always teasing me by playing with my hair/tickling me. Maybe it's because I'm a teenager and no other guy touches me really, but I've found I get incredibly turned on by his random touching. For example, today he started playing with the stitching on my jeans while we were talking and suddenly I was just so horny. It's starting to actually bother me because I feel like all the horniness is just building up and each time I get more and more affected by him. mixed in with the guilt of feeling this way, it's not really a nice combination to be experiencing. 

I'm not really sure what to do because I'm still dating Lucas, but we're never intimate, and I'm obviously physically attracted to Mark, but I don't think I would be interested in pursuing a romantic relationship with him so I don't think I would find it worth it to toss my relationship with Lucas away for something with Mark. I'm not even sure Mark is interested in me.

Yet at the same time I've never really felt this attraction to Lucas before. I'm kind of inexperienced in this department since Lucas was my first real romantic encounter with boys (other than one in 7th grade for 2 weeks, which doesn't count) so any advice is appreciated! I guess I'm wondering

1) is Lucas's non-intimacy odd?

2) does Mark seem interested? if so, would it be worth pursuing?

3) how can I bring it up with Lucas without damaging our relationship?

A few days ago however we went to the cinema together because we had to wait for her boyfriend who wouldn't get there for the next 4 hours. During the movie we started making out. And prior to this I already had the idea that she might be interested. But during the movie she clearly told me that she liked me but was confused on what to do.

Fast forwarding to yesterday. We decided to go out, go to the city and just have some fun. And again this resulted in making out on a regular basis. I found out that her boyfriend had been treating her unfairly, always cranky and just a bit annoying towards her, making her feel unwanted. Whereas I made her feel loved. This kind of made me happy cus I felt like I had a chance with her. However, when I dropped her off at her place she told me she wanted to give her boyfriend another try. And she still wants to be friends. I'd be lying if I said that it didn't hurt my feelings, but I know I can't force her into anything, nor do I want to.

We're going out today again, and I really doubt it'll be the last time. I'm unsure on what to do though, since I know I'm in love with her, and I know she's interested.

I met my partner online in late August. I got vibes that he was on the prowl and expected nothing serious to come of our fling. Things ended up escalating quickly, and by late October, we chose to be exclusive.  


He was traveling abroad for work over the holidays, and so, to avoid having nearly an entire month away from each other, he suggested we plan a vacation together. We booked an exciting trip across multiple countries, and were both nervous and excited at the prospect of traveling together and learning more about each other.  


In December, he left for his work obligations. I left to spend Christmas with some family abroad, and about two weeks later, we reunited in Spain. We spent ten days together, meeting friends, eating, and exploring. We had a few tiffs and discovered a few personality differences along the way, but the trip brought us closer, and we both seemed to fall very much in love. (Note: He had already told me he loved me before he left. I took a bit longer to warm up, but felt the same.)  


When we got home, things continued going really well. He introduced me to more close friends, he met mine. My birthday was coming up, so he suggested we spend the weekend visiting my parents. Things were moving rather quickly, but I was happy to be swept along with this special person. One weekend, a couple of weeks after our vacation, he had left to run errands for an hour in the morning. I opened up his iPad to use the internet, since I had left my computer at my apartment. I typed in the security code that he had given me, and began puttering around. I opened photobooth to take a photo of myself (haha), and then went into the photo album. I saw that the photos were synced to his phone, so there were some from our vacation. Then I saw a kind of professional porny photo, which I didn't mind. He actually doesn't look at porn very much, apparently - I'm way more permissive when it comes to porn than he thinks I should be. Then I froze. There was a topless selfie of a woman and another cell phone photo of her underwear-clad body. They were from mid-December while he was away, but before we had reunited.  


My animal brain took over, and I opened his email. I went into trash and found an exchange that happened over two days between my boyfriend and this woman. He was soliciting sex, giving her the same lines he had given me in the beginning (you dudes are so obvious, really). He had also sent her a video of himself jerking off. Obviously, I was pretty devastated. Shaking. I felt ill. Sent an angry text. Etc.  


When he got home, I confronted him with what I'd found, and he came clean immediately. He had no justification for his actions. He was lonely and horny. Craving attention. He had created another account on the site we had used to meet and started an exchange with this woman. He said that it lasted only those 2 or 3 days, and he had intended to bury it and move on. He said that they hadn't met up, that in truth he hadn't really wanted it to move into reality. The only reason I believe this is because, although our initial exchanges had been very sexually charged when we first met, when it came to sleeping together, he needed more of an emotional connection than even I did before he could really get down. Once we had a bit more intimacy and had gotten to know each other, the sex got really good and has only continued to get better as we have grown together.


As much as I hated doing this, I asked for full access to his phone. He understood and immediately gave me the passwords without resentment. I scoured his email, facebook, texts, and other accounts. He came out clean. He had couple of bordering-on-flirtatious exchanges with exes over facebook, but nothing I'd have looked at twice in a normal context. I actually found an exchange where he told a woman he was seeing me and so would not be meeting up with her abroad as they had planned to do before we'd met. I also saw emails where he told friends about our relationship, that things were going well and he was serious about me. I brought up the flirtatious messages, and he said that he would cut off almost any relationship I deemed superfluous (unless it was something ridiculous like his ex-wife or a long-time friend from years and years ago). He did so. He said he would go to therapy (eye-roll, but still important) in order to examine why, when he valued our relationship so much, he would act in such a way. He did and is doing so. He said he would come clean to my parents and ask for their forgiveness (I told him that was unnecessary).  


As I rollercoastered through emotions, he was always open and patient. He answered questions multiple times. At one point, when I thought I couldn't take the emotional turmoil anymore, he rushed out of work and came to see me at my office in a snow storm. I've met his parents. He is always available for me. Always includes me in plans. He doesn't cling to his phone or log out of his computer every time he leaves the room. I hate to admit this, but he didn't change his phone password, and there were a few times that I could not control my anxiety-induced impulse to snoop again. He came out clean each time.  


So things have moved along with ups and downs. I love him, but was having trouble with insecurity and anxiety. I have shared this story with my therapist, best friend, and even my parents. All parties felt that I'd be justified in leaving, but that I wasn't an idiot for staying. Despite doubts, the reality of the situation is that I love this man. He is a supportive and caring partner. He loves me unconditionally. Since being with him, I have grown as a person.  


It's April, and we have been discussing moving in together since March. A couple of weeks ago, my doubt and anxiety cycles hit a peak, and I felt that leaving was the solution, so I broke up with him. I am diagnosed with anxiety and am currently not on any meds. When I split with my boyfriend, the relief I expected to feel did not happen. He wrote me very heartfelt letters stating that he wanted this relationship to work and that he believes in us, but that he only wanted me to stay if I was happy and that he'd love and respect me either way. I decided to give it another shot, to really truly trust him again, and to love with abandon. He is a good person and his actions display his love for me.  


We are moving in together at the end of the month, and I am thrilled, but sometimes, I get scared again. I suppose I'm writing to gather your thoughts and opinions. My track record isn't squeeky clean, but I believe I'm a good person worthy of forgiveness. I also don't believe, as many do, that infidelity is the worst of offenses, punishable by death. It's pretty bad, but not the worst. Anyway... am I a fool?

Here's the situation:

I have recently met a girl. We're both working as summer interns at some company not worth mentioning, and over these past 2 weeks we've become nicely acquainted.

Now, I don't normally communicate very well. I'm more of a shut-in. (There's a running joke among the other interns that I'm an Old Scrooge that hates everyone.) But, this girl has really taken initiative to get to know me. At first, it was rather uncomfortable; but over time, she really has grown on me. I've found out that I really enjoy her company, her personality, and we share quite a few hobbies and interests. She's pretty awesome.

She and a friend of hers came up to me last week and asked if I had any plans this weekend. I said no, then asked if they had any. They both said they weren't up to snuff, so I insisted we hang out. They were cool with that and we all exchanged numbers.

On Saturday, we met up to watch a movie. All went well. We had the typical movie theater experience and walked out at the end of the credits. The girl I liked decided we should do something else, so I recommended we head to the beach. They thought it was a fun idea.

Now, this is where I get confused...

We made it to the beach at 11:30pm. We built a nice little fire, cracked a couple beers, and began to chill out. We're all sitting around chitchatting and whatnot, and there's, what I think, some flirting going on. It's then I start getting the courage to make a move. *Thanks, beer.*

I, lamely, ask her if I may kiss her.

I must've caught her pretty off guard, because she just laughed. Not menacingly, I don't think. Then says, Uhhhhhhh. That was really straight straightforward. I don't know.

It falls quiet for a bit. It stung. But, I ask, So, is that a 'no' then? And she replies with another laugh and says, I don't know.

At this point, I'm just wishing she'd say no, because I'm flustered a bit. So, I pipe in, A maybe, then? And she replies, Yeah. Maybe later.

I'm thinking I completely fucked it all up, and I think I got shot down. But, her friend that was with us, later said, You weren't shut down, you were just delayed.

We stayed until sunrise, drove home, and after a quick Thanks, it was fun we separated and haven't spoken for the rest of today. 

I feel uneasy because I really do like this girl. I'm clueless. I don't know if there's still a chance, or if I potentially ruined a friendship with awkwardness.

I'm seeing her tomorrow at work, and I have no idea how I'm to interact...

So, guys, please talk to me. Haha

He and I met for breakfast this morning, during which he gleefully admitted to sleeping with another woman behind his fiance's back some two weeks after his proposal to her. The situation he placed himself in was entirely preventable. He has no remorse, no intention of telling his fiance about what happened, and is boastful as to the likelihood of doing it again should the opportunity arise.

In a very real way, I feel as though I've lost my only real friend. I have strong trust issues, myself, from having witnessed my mother cheat on my father as a child. Now, I see him as a disingenuous and conniving scoundrel whom I can't trust--especially if he's willing to betray the person he regards as closest to himself.

Eventually I asked her out saying Hey I think you're cute, let's hang out sometime. She said No thanks, I'm not looking for anything at the moment. And that was that.

Fast forward two months later and she's suddenly down to hang out with me and get coffee or play games. We finally met up and met at the Dining Commons on campus to have dinner. It was nice and I got to know her better. She seemed a little nervous to talk to me and kept asking me questions.

And then days later I asked her to the dining commons again to grab lunch and we had another nice outing of mostly talking and learning about each other. I told her she looked nice today when we met and she said the same back to me.

I'm getting kind of into her but I'm not sure how she views this. I'm afraid that she thinks we're just friends and that she thinks it's great to have a friend to hang out with(I don't think she has many friends). 

I'm thinking of straight up asking her out on a date, but she told me she isn't the type to go on 'dates'. Then again I feel I have to express interest somehow. I was thinking about asking her to get thai food with me for dinner since she said she loves thai.

Any advice on how to turn this relationship from just hanging out to dating would be great. Thanks.

Every time we had sex, it was great. We both expressed how much we enjoyed it, and it was definitely respectful, fun, and very satisfying.

Although the sex was awesome, there was a connection missing between us. It wasn't easy for us to open up to each other. This was something I was pretty anxious about from the beginning, we knew each other as colleagues at first and then suddenly we noticed this strong attraction to each other. What concerned me from the beginning was that I hadn't really felt that companionate or best friend factor but things happened quickly, and we both developed feelings for each other regardless. But we both felt the disconnect and eventually he became more and more distant, and I became more and more anxious. 

Amid exams and work, we finally got the chance to sit down and talk about things, after 1.5 months of feeling the anxiety between us. We acknowledged this missing relationship component and came to a mutual decision to stop seeing each other. We both really care, respect and admire each other, so things ended much better than I imagined.

It's been a day and I feel mostly relieved. I know I will have sad moments, but I'm focusing on embracing solitude and developing myself. This wasn't even an official relationship and it exhausted me! 

Now my question is, what kind of attachments can develop when having sex with your first? I know many friends who have become SUPER attached with the obsessive phone calls and texts, and the one word or rejecting messages back. That is definitely not me, or ... I hope so. Perhaps it's at different degrees, and I'm still figuring out where I lie, but I'm just curious to know what have other people's experiences been like with losing their virginity and breaking up? Does sex complicate things emotionally after your relationship ends? Does it make it harder to get over someone? Or does it really matter? Does it have to matter? What are the different views about sex and attachment? 

Thanks for the read, I'm simply looking to get some ideas and perspectives on how analyze my thoughts and emotions.  This is a very new process to me and I know there are no concrete answers and that it will take time to adjust. Thankssss :)

23096,Breakups,25948v,"This is going to be a long story because of some background details needed to understand the situation.  

My ex girlfriend's had a rough time growing up. Her mom and dad partied and drank a lot and she was most likely the result of this. Her mom who would disappear on her mother, my ex's grandmother, for days on end without telling ended up in jail at one point and my ex's dad cheated on her. When her mother got out, her mother blamed her father for a lot of what happened to her and took my ex as a small child away from him. Left in such an emotional state where he thought he had lost everything, he killed himself when my ex was 3. Her mother then moved on to her stepfather, I think it was, whom my ex used tell me that she would hide under the bed while she could hear her stepfather beating her mother. They are no longer together. As a result my ex developed has developed depression and PTSD over the years. 

Eventually her mother became a Jehovah's Witness and my ex became one too as a result. She and I met in elementary school and at the beginning of 7th grade, we both developed feelings for each other. Due to her religion and some of her issues, she disappeared after 7th grade and I never heard from her again. That is, until early last year. 

She messaged me on Facebook, wanting to reconnect and we immediately hit it off again to the point where I realized that I still after all these years had feelings for her. We met in person shortly afterwards and she would later tell me that she realized after this meeting that she had feelings for me too after near a decade of not seeing me. She, at the time, was dating a guy she met on the internet. She had made a lot of friends over the internet because she was very isolated because of her religion and pretty much forbidden to talk to anyone outside the Jehovah's Witnesses. A few weeks after we connected, her boyfriend ended things, she was devastated but we got together not too long afterwards on Valentine's Day of 2013. I had been in college during this time period so a lot of our relationship was over texting, phone calls, and Skype since I was 3 hours away but I still came home every other weekend to see her.

At this time, she revealed to me she was planning on leaving the Jehovah's Witnesses because she realized she was happier when not following their beliefs. This lead to her mother declaring that her religion was more important and that despite the fact that my ex lived in a house with her mother and grandmother, her mother said she could no longer live with her. I graduated and moved home and she was still struggling to find a place to live. Eventually, she told my mom and dad her story and my parents insisted that she move in with us. She did so last summer and she quickly became a part of my family. My mother and father treated her like the daughter they never had and she was with me at both of my grandmother's funerals (yes I lost both of my grandmothers in a single year) and when my childhood dog had to be put down to which she had become very attached. 

 I should also mention that a few months into our relationship, we decided to get intimate and I was her first sexual partner. She stated that she realized how sex could be amazing and that she never realized until then how love could play a role in one's sex life. Also over the summer, my mom and dad (one was a teacher and the other a professor) helped her to get into college. She wanted to be a psychologist or some sort of therapist to help others with drug problems and/or issues like depression. She started school that fall and said that she really loved learning and was enjoying school. Despite this, she was having trouble getting to know people and make friends. Part of this, she said was the fact that she was four years older than most of the other freshman but did make some friends. By semester's end she had made dean's list and even would mention that despite the stress of school, being there for her family (her aunt and cousin lived nearby and she still visited grandmother frequently) without her religion, my dad being the father she never had, my mom being the mother she never had, and me being her best friend, she stated that she felt like life had never felt so perfect. She would make me promise her before bed sometimes that we would alway be together. She also hated that her cousin who had just gotten out of rehab due to some sort of addiction was hanging out with pot heads and hated that her best girl friend also used weed to help her cope with her life on an almost regular basis.

I would notice sometimes that her depression would get the best of her sometimes because she would sleep for long periods of time and didn't always want to go out. Sometimes my anger would get the best of me and when I would yell, her PTSD because of her stepfather would bother her. I'm ashamed to say that I didn't always know how to handle these moments. Back during the final weeks of the semester, we got into an argument where she declared that I may not be the one for her and that I wasn't trying hard enough to get a job (I was struggling to get a job in my area) and that I wasn't independent enough. She went to stay with her aunt and later that night, I got a series of texts apologizing saying how she misses me, can't sleep without me, that her depression was getting the best of her, that the fact that it seemed like we were an old married couple freaked her out, and that she felt stupid for freaking out. We both agreed that maybe she should seek therapy and I would go with her if needs be to seek help for caused her outburst. 

Now my parents had retired last year and as such, would travel and left both of us in charge of the house for weeks on end. Last winter, they left for florida and left of us in charge of the house until they were to return in late March. Now my ex was starting her second semester and I noticed was getting stressed already by some of her classes. I tried to make her feel better like getting chocolates when she wasn't feeling well and she would say how she doesn't know what she did to deserve me. During the last week of january and first week of february, she went out on a friday night that she was going to her girlfriend's house for a couple hours and wouldn't be back late or drink because she had work in the morning. She wouldn't return until 2 in the morning and said she was drunk. She had received an iPad that christmas (her very first christmas since she was never allowed to celebrate it or any other major holiday including her birthday because of Jehovah's Witness practices) and said we could share it so we shared an iPad. She didn't realize that her texts from her phone and Facebook came through and i found out later that she was gone for so long because she was with this guy walking around town talking. I didn't confront her about it until a couple days later when I similar incident happened in which she promised she wouldn't be out later but was because she was with her girlfriend and this guy and this group of friends they are both apart of. I should mention that her girlfriend is about 6 years younger, this guy at least 3 years. That next tuesday she got home late from work as she usual did. That night was her long work night. She immediately wanted to go out and I went with her and it was with this group again that included this guy. This guy is a stoner pot head with the kind of voice that is literally just annoying and he clearly is ...just not smart to be honest. He had no job, was living in an apart that wasn't his with some other guys who were all part of a band that my ex's cousin was a part of. We got into a fight while we were hanging out and I stated that I didn't know why she was hanging out with these type of stoner people all of a sudden and it ended with me stating that I just wanted her to be honest since would rarely say she was hanging out with these guys when i asked. She stated how I was probably the most understanding guy she ever knew and how we'll be okay. I left the group because it was getting later and i wanted to sleep and i assumed she would be back soon. She didn't return home until the next morning. 

A similar thing happened the next day when she went to do a favor for one of the group's friends. She said she wouldn't be out long because of a hangover and after an hour, i asked where she was because she and I had made dinner plans at the house and she said she was hanging out with them and wanted to stay with them. She came home and made dinner and I confronted her about her behavior lately and she said that she's been very stressed with school and that hanging out with these guys and drinking and smoking are her methods of running away from her problems. We had a long talk that ended with us getting it all out in the open and me saying i just want her to be honest. It was very good for us or so I thought. She even stated that she would try to be home earlier and that it was like our relationship had been renewed. She then asked me if she could hang out with them again that night and I said while i was disappointed, I said yes if she would be home early. 

I got a text about midnight saying she was drunk and had broken her promise. I told her it was fine because things take time and i would come get her. I didn't hear from her again for hours until she texted me that she was sorry for worrying me, that she was a horrible person, and i should just go to sleep. I wasn't sure what that meant and stayed awake to make sure she got home because this was during the really bad snow storms this past winter and i was afraid something bad was going to happen to her. 

I'm about to go over the limit so I'll continue in the comments.

23097,Breakups,259i9o,"Ok guys so here goes. I went out with my ex for 2 1/2 years and in January she dumped me. Now she had all the reason to as I constantly lied to her and went behind her back. I cheated on her when we first started going out and lied to her about it numerous times throughout the course of the relationship. After finnally admitting this to her among other things she broke up with me. 

I cannot blame her as I treated someone witn an amazing heart so poorly. Throughout the past few months I have done a lot of self-reflecting with the help of a psychotherapist and have begun to realize my ways of thinking are almost entirely illogical. In a way by being hurt in the past, i thought my ex would hurt me thus i kept ties open with other women. Furthermore toward the end our relationship became boring and very routine. 

In terms of trying to contact my ex, I told her I wanted to fix things and didnt want to give up on her. I was certainly a bit of a texting terrorist and I did call her on two occasions. The last time I saw her a few months ago we were both drunk and had sex, however we had an AMAZING night full of laughs etcc.. Now when i tried to call her a few months back she was crying and yelling told me to leave her alone. She blocked my number and her father called me and told me to stop calling her. Although to be honest I really hadnt called her/texted her much at all. But i understand that her family sees her upset.Some of you may think I do not know how she is feeling but i have a pretty good idea that she was/ is?  still very upset about the situation. She put her all into me and I am so ashamed and hurt to know that I fucked with her and didnt give back what I couldve. I have said sorry countless times and tried to tell her what I was thinking at the time but it didnt seem to have much of an effect (no shit).

I think about her everyday, allday. I have been dumped before and felt bad but this is horrible.All my friends have told me to move on and not worry about it. Dating for me seems to be making the problem worse. Every night I dream of her, and i always wake up and realize an illusion is just an illusion, no matter how real.

Recently I have decided I cannot continue on like this. I am thinking of either sending her an email myself or getting my bestfriend to message her through facebook to try to initiate a form of conversation. I do not even hope to get her back although that would be a miracle. I think my goal as of now is to get her on the phone and tell her how sorry I am. If she responds with go fuck yourself then I understand and wont talk to her again.

This will be tough if not impossible as her friends/family are very against me. My shrink advised me to wait it out and he thinks she will come back (i disagree).

Basically guys.... What should I do to try to talk to her again.

P.S. Yes i know im a jerk/dick/asshole and she deserves better. Thanks.

Anyway, our first date was awesome, ended it with a little making out, etc. second date was also awesome, we spent a ton of time together just chatting, etc. she was really cuddly &amp; intimate with me during the second date, especially at the end. I think she likes me!

Things that confuse me: 

1) she said she doesn't know how intense she wants things to get [not sure what she meant, she referenced the fact that she moved here recently, etc]. after this she got mildly awkward, i said no problem I'm a laid back guy, and she was really happy (and was more intimate than before actually) 

2) at the same time, totally out of the blue the very next morning after our 2nd date, she texted me saying she had a great time. so like, that's a little bit confusing to me - in my experience, unless a girl is quite interested she is not the one to reach out so quickly after a date (she texted me &lt;10 hours after our date. she's very pretty, and I can tell she's quite conservative ... so I can't imagine her being the one who reaches out to the guy).

23113,Dating,1pirsj,"Hey guys! At the beginning of the school year I took a liking to my lab partner and we began to hit it off almost instantly. I got her number and she would text me to initiate conversation and I would do the same. We would walk from class, had inside, jokes, constantly playfully touched in lab (pretty much our legs were always in contact. I invited her for some food after class and we went and had a great time. Than she invited me for smoothies and we went and had another great time. Honestly things could not be going any better. Textbook boy likes girl and the other way around. Than she changed out of nowhere. She would not respond to my texts and she just seemed like she didn't want to talk to me as much as before. Stopped responding to texts one in a while, never initiated converstations via text, and when we were in lab she just never seemed interested in the conversation and pretty much did a complete 360. I shrugged it off and thought she found someone else and proceeded to start meeting other people. However, it started to go back to its old ways of us talking, but not over text, only in person. what i mean is that she still never initiated conversation and seldomly responded and if she did it was a short response. In class we were the same as before but outside of it we were still in the complete 360. I stopped talking to her for about a week since we didnt have lab and I never texted her. After that week we have a test coming up and I go to extra lab hours to study. People leave as time goes on, but I notice how it was just me and her at the end and we started talking again. It turned into the deepest conversation I ever had with the girl. She talked about how pretty much she wasnt over her ex, wasn't confident in her looks, and felt that she was depressed. I recently was depressed and gave m experience and it cheered her up a bit, but I told her to go seek advice. She proceeded to tell me that only her best friend and I new about this which made me feel good because she had confidence that I could keep a secret. I got the vibe that she said these things because she wanted to go further with me but was just in a bad spot at the time. However, I asked her if she was going to this Halloween party and she said she was. She asked if I was and looked pretty excited when I told her I was. We proceeded to walk together away from lab and when it was time to go our separate ways she kept talking, but her body language made it seem as if she didn't want to leave. She kept asking me questions and tried to keep the conversation going. Finally we went our seperate ways and I shot her a text 15 minutes later saying if she ever needed anything I was there for her and she said she was thankful . So my question is should I persue a relationship with this girl or does she see me as a good friend?

23117,Breakups,2wzpas,"My girlfriend of 1.5 years broke up with me two days ago. We had some small issues that had been resolved in the past but we seemed to be doing really well. She was in another long term relationship before me and her reasoning was she wanted to be single for a change. She is also a college athlete and we are both busy in school and I'm very involved in my fraternity and Greek life in general so we are both very busy. 

So her other reason was we both needed to focus on other things and make her own friends. To me though it just seems like she wasn't thinking about this very long. For Valentine's day she gave me a box with 150 things she liked about me and told me to open 1 a day and was excited that it would last most of summer since we cant be together. 5 days later she broke up with me. When she was breaking up with me she also said she still loved me very much and wanted to get back together in the future hopefully. 

She's been really busy and stressed lately and she was also on her period (I would never bring that up though) and I thought maybe that could influence the quick decision. This is really really hard for me so maybe her reasoning makes perfect sense but I cant see it. There isn't any bad blood and I would never want to be a crazy ex but I was thinking about texting her today and ask how she was doing. Or should I wait and hope she misses me and comes back? She was my support system and now she is gone.

Dear Kate,

I would like to share true story.

In 2005 I was courting a girl named Rene. At the time I met her cousin David. I grew to admire David cause he had the charming gift of wooing woman. I Recall I wanted to be just like him. Ultimately courting Rene was futile, however years later news filtered that Rene was lesbian and travels with a caged rabbit. Till this day I am still not sure if the fruitless courting makes me feel better or worse.

In 2008 David was diagnosed with cancer. He died after a short battle.
David's story and the fact I admired him so much gave the inspiration to quit smoking. I quit for 3 years before resuming the habit.

Recently I have again been inspired to quit smoking.

Perhaps a random unexpected act from a stranger whose kindness and willingness to share a small part of her life with mine, albeit brief, is a akin to a hurricane contingent on a distant butterfly flapping its wings many weeks earlier, better known as the 'butterfly affect'.

Just like the hurricane and the butterfly, this time the inspiration has come from you.

My friend feels that he is finally ready to start dating after getting himself debt-free, in a solid career, and out of school. He is interested in checking out some of the popular online dating sites but is nervous because he lives at home.

Fast forward to us moving in together. Everything is great for a few months, with the occasional fight that quickly gets dealt with and moved on. Then about 2 weeks ago we have a gigantic fight, and she leaves to go cool off. This is normal for her, and it allows me to cool off and think as well. She comes back and she starts talking about how every time we fight she feels like we're less and less compatible, and that maybe we shouldn't be together. Again we talked about the issues we were having and we moved on. Or so i thought.


Yesterday she comes home from work and I'm sitting on the couch zoning out when she very quietly says  I don't want to get get married anymore I ask why and she says that she had been thinking about breaking up ever since our last fight and that there were too many little things that were just too much. She decides to go for a drive. I sat on the couch completely dumbfounded. I took my ring off, and went and got an air mattress. I'm trying to figure out what to do because i know no ones here and have no family or support here. I moved out here to be with her specifically, and I am now completely stranded here with a new job i just started last week. I have no money in savings because of unexpected expenses, and we're stuck in this lease for a year. which we started in february.


She comes home, and at that time I'm lying on the air mattress trying to sleep. I get up and she says hi and all that. Then I sit down on the bed and she sits down on the floor and I ask her what the little things were. 


She goes on to tell me that she didn't like how uneven the employment situation was with us, she has two jobs and supported us until i got a job. she says that thats better now but she still was upset by it. She then goes on to tell me about how she doesn't like being silly in public. Now when she says silly, she means like dancing to the music in a store and stuff like that. which is something i can definitely something i can stop doing. Next she tells me that she doesn't feel like she can be herself around me anymore, and that she's limited in what she can do here. She likes to take 6+ hour naps, which i don't like that she does and I try not to get irritated when she does it but occasionally i do. I also told her that her smoking trees with her 15 y/o sister makes me uncomfortable, but i've already told her i don't care anymore. 


I told her that all of the things she listed were completely fixable, with communication and compromise. I had no idea that she felt like that for any of those things and if she would have just spoke to me about them when they happened i would have immediately done what i could to work on things and to compromise with her.

I found out he went out of town with some friends and it was just the final straw for me. I don't want to waste my time on shitty friends anymore but I still feel bad.

Background: I (27f) was raised by my mom (49f), who had me in her early 20s, and her parents.  When I was little I would occasionally ask who my dad is, and she would always say she'd tell me when I was older.

When I was about 20 she told me his name and the situation.  After something bad happened to her when she was 18, she said she spiraled out of control, drinking, drugs, etc.  She also had an affair with her brother's married friend, J.  When she found out she was pregnant, she told him but she claimed that she didn't know if it was his, or another man's.  She told me, in the retelling, that she was sure I was J's child, but she wanted him to leave his wife for her, not for his child.  He did not leave his wife, they broke up, and my mom intended to have an abortion.

She just kept putting it off until finally my grandfather asked if she was pregnant.  She said yes, and he asked what she was going to do.  She said she was going keep it (she hadn't had any prenatal care and so didn't know what she was having), and he said good.  I had a happy childhood with my grandparents, and when I was 16 my mom got married.  A few years later we moved out of state for my stepfather's job, and I'm happy living in this state with my boyfriend and our two small children.

I've known my father's name these past seven years, and would kind of halfheartedly google him once in a while, but I never did find him, so contacting him was a moot point. Not having a father never seemed like a big loss to me, because my grandfather was the coolest dude ever.  Now that he's gone, and now that I have two children of my own, I'm feeling more curious about that side of my family.

Yesterday I played with the spelling of J's last name, and there he was.  I also found J's son.  One of my first memories is playing with that kid on my mom's waterbed when they came to hang out with my uncle at our house.  Facebook profiles with pictures of J's daughter, too, and even a cell phone number for J.  I can't tell if J is still married to the woman he cheated on, because it's just listed as 'since 2008,' but maybe that's when he got a Facebook.  For what it's worth, it looks like we don't have a lot in common, politically, interests, careers, etc.

I'm not sure I want to contact these people and upset their lives, and I'm absolutely certain I don't want to upset my mom (or my stepfather, for that matter).  She's got depression and my younger sibling is autistic, which is stressful for her.  I'm very non-confrontational (I haven't brought up my father since she told me the story years ago) and would just feel like shit if I made someone feel shitty, especially my mom.  Normally this would be a decision I could put off until the holidays, when we go back to our home state to see family, but in the near future we're going home to see my cousin graduate.  So, if I did want to see these people, I could do it, but I have no idea how to get the ball rolling.  I would, and I'm sure they would want a DNA test, too.  I can't tell if wanting to talk to them is just morbid curiosity on my part, a curiosity that can go unsated, or if I'll really regret it if I never reach out to them.  I think I want them to meet my children, I think I want to know about my family, but I don't know.

21692,Non-Romantic,3cbslm,"Hi, /r/relationships. Firstly, it's currently 3am and I suspect this will turn out pretty confused and rambly, because I'm feeling a bit crazy, so I'm sorry in advance for that!

On Saturday night, I had a small party (20ish people, all friends with one another) at my house which started at 8pm. At 9pm, my close friend 'Joe' texted me saying that he wouldn't be able to come because the night before (ie. Friday night) his family had gone on a spontaneous trip (he blamed his parents' mid life crises) to a beachside town about an hour away which I will call Beachtown. He said we would catch up once he got back.

At the time I was mostly just bummed out because I really like Joe (okay, I *really* like Joe, and I was planning to tell him that that night, but that's another story), and though the thought of why did he not tell me until now? did cross my mind, Joe's pretty bad at using his phone, so whatever. The party went on.

Towards the end of the night we were texting back and forth a little (for the record, I wasn't just sitting on my phone at my own party! Just a couple of texts), and then he said that he was going to bed, and then Really wish I was at your party right now. I'm not sure how to explain why this is significant, but basically Joe's usually very sarcastic and non-emotional, and yet that text came across as very genuine, which was unexpected (but nice!). God, I must sound like an idiot. Basically, it seemed like he was truly sorry he couldn't be there and wished he was.

Party ended, couple of people passed out drunk on my couch, life goes on.

This evening (Monday) I texted Joe asking when he'd be back from Beachtown, and how was it, etc. He says he'll be back Tuesday night or Wednesday morning, and mentions a couple of things he's done there. Cool.

A while later I checked Snapchat, and one of Joe's close friends, 'Mark' (not invited to my party) had sent a funny picture of Joe's face while he and Joe and a group of their friends (not invited either) are having brunch this morning. Huh, I thought, they must all be down at Beachtown. But for some reason I felt a little suspicious, and I went on Mark's Instagram. There's a photo of his brunch (Mark is the kinda guy who takes photos of nice meals), and it's definitely the same place as was in the Snapchat photo (the times match up as well). But the place is not in Beachtown, it's here in our city. (In fact, it's 5 minutes from my house.)

And here we are - it's 4am, and I'm lying awake trying to work out why Joe would have lied about this. That is, *if* he lied. Here is a simple timeline:

* Friday: Joe 'goes to Beachtown'.

* Saturday: I have a party. Joe texts me that he can't come because he's in Beachtown.

* Monday: Joe is 100% not in Beachtown. Yet, Joe tells me that he'll be returning from Beachtown on Tues or Wed.

To me, it seems pretty clear that he is lying, but I cannot fathom why. Say he just didn't want to come to my party, that he was busy hanging out with the friends he was with in Mark's photo - there are much easier lies that 'being out of town', but alright. But then, why hide that he's back? He could have easily said he came back on the Sunday instead of lying twice, right? 

I have *tried* to put together the events in a way that means he's telling the truth. Maybe he WAS in Beachtown on Saturday night, then came back here and had brunch today and then went back to Beachtown. But that just seems like a strange thing to do. Also, I feel like he would have mentioned that when we chatted today. Furthermore, it's just weird that he didn't bother letting me know that he was there until an hour into the party.

Sorry, I just realised how long this is getting, I'll try to wrap up. I just don't understand what I should do now. These are the options I've come up with.

* Neglect asking him about Beachtown, continue as normal, pretend it didn't happen so he doesn't have to lie, accept that he must have had his reasons, but spend the rest of my life not knowing wtf that was.

* Ask him regular questions about his Beachtown trip and see if he mentions coming back here at any point - basically, find out whether or not he's lying. 

* Blunt did you lie to me?

To me, the last two options seem ... morally wrong. I'm sure he had a good reason to lie. I don't want to be interrogating him, trying to trip him up. But it's burning in my brain, I *need* to know.

As I mentioned before, I'm romantically interested in Joe. I get along with him better than anyone I've ever met. Several of his friends have promised me that he feels the same way. But he's had almost zero experience with girls so I've been trying to build up to things slowly (maybe too slowly, he seems really oblivious - hence I was planning on confessing feelings on Saturday night!). Now I just feel really weird about it all. Not sure what to do. I'm definitely less interested in him if he's needlessly deceitful. This is the first time I've ever noticed him doing anything 'negative', I'm usually thinking of him as the Best Person Ever blah blah blah. I dunno.

21696,Non-Romantic,33meb1,"Backstory: My uncle was a pretty terrible person. 25+ years ago, he had a daughter when he was in his mid-thirties with a 15-year-old. He was controlling and abusive, so she took the baby (my cousin, C) and ran away. I grew up knowing that my cousin C existed, but nothing else. My uncle had no contact with his ex or his daughter for years.

About 7 years ago when C was now an adult, she asked her mom for enough details to find her family and she located me online. We met and became quite close. She sought out her father/my uncle to see for herself if he was as terrible as her mother always said. By this time, his mental and physical health had deteriorated a lot and after a few phone conversations with him that didn't go well, she decided that she didn't want him in her life.

My aunts (his sisters) had disliked my cousin C from the start and this only fueled their hatred further. They harassed her about her decision to not have a relationship with her father and she decided to cut them out of her life too. At this point, I'm pretty much the only one with a relationship with C. This has seriously strained my relationship with my aunts because they want me to hate C and I don't. I support the choice she made regarding her father and love her very much.

Today, I got a text from another cousin (E) letting my know that my uncle/C's father had passed away. She asked me to call C and let her know since I'm the only one close with her. I did so. C was not particularly upset but thanked me for telling her. She asked me if I had any details about his death or a funeral or anything, and I didn't. When we hung up, I called my aunt P (E's mother) to ask.

Aunt P FLIPPED out at me and asked how dare I tell C about my uncle/her father. I told her that her daughter E had texted me and asked that I do so. I'd assumed she knew. Aunt P went on ranting and cursing at me, saying that she didn't want C to know and she had no right to know since she didn't want to be in his life when he was alive, etc. I told her that she was being ridiculous and of course C had a right to know. The woman went ballistic and said that if C dared to show up to a funeral, she'd kick her ass, blah blah.

So now I don't know what to do. Do I tell C that she's not welcome at the funeral and there will be trouble if she comes? C might be stubborn enough to come just to spite Aunt P. Do I stay out of it and not relay funeral information to C at all? Also, although I think this is mostly emotionally motivated, I can't help but wonder if there's a financial aspect to it as well since C is my uncle's next of kin and may be eligible for my uncle's social security or pension or something. Maybe that's why Aunt P didn't want her to find out he was dead.

Regardless, I'm pretty sure my relationship with Aunt P is over and I'm disgusted that she's behaving this way, but I'm not sure what I should do now, if anything.

21697,Non-Romantic,3gwwdy,"I never realized that my life was *abnormal* or that the way in which I was being treated by my mother was considered *abusive*.

Her fits, her anxiety, her story-telling...I thought that was just a thing that all women dealt with. I thought she was a normal mother.

She would fall asleep while driving on long car rides. She'd abuse her prescription pills and sleep like she was dead for hours and then at night she would stay up all night and tear the house apart and keep everybody awake. She moved us around nine times before I was even nine myself. She overreacted to every situation, dramaticized every single detail to the point where she was literally ruining our lives. She lied about my dad's identity being stolen because she spent too much on his credit card. She made herself believe it and **drove herself crazy**. She hired a private investigator to punish a man that didn't exist. She claimed he sent her e-mails about watching my younger sister (now 16) and I play in the yard. And she did all of this before I was a teenager.

By the time I was 15, I couldn't remember what she was like sober. Whether she was drugged up or drunk, she didn't know how to function without abusing some sort of substance. She'd make friends with the neighborhood sleeze-bags who would buy her prescription pills off of her once in a while. They'd come over at odd hours and stay all night. 

We used to be fairly wealthy because my dad would work so often (which is why her behavior went overlooked). We had a vacation home in the mountains. I could sense a separation was coming up. She started spending time with the 25 yr/old unemployed guy that worked on our roof at our vacation home. Eventually, he had practically moved in. They destroyed the house together, spray painted the ceilings with strange verses that looked like some sort of dark poetry. They knocked down walls and sold all of our belongings (bikes, books, computers, DVD players, TVs) for drugs while we (my sister, brother, and I) were at home going to school and living life without her.

One day, she made us a ham dinner and left and we didn't hear from her for weeks.

She's been back since after years of late night phone calls from strange men's cell phones and suicide threats when she had nobody to be with. 

She's been in and out of rehab. She has lived in multiple sober homes. Now, she is in a relationship with a 25 yr/old man from El Salvador who doesn't let her leave the house, causing her to drink even more. She will have crazy bouts, mostly on weekend evenings, where she calls all of us over and over again without really having much to say. She demands my brother (who is 11 now and was 5 when she walked out on us) come visit her most weekends but 9/10 times he calls home in the middle of night crying because he's afraid and she's going nuts.

With her gone, my dad has been dating. He is a very good electrician but a very unlucky one. He's suffered financially from multiple lay-offs in the past; sometimes, he waits years to be next on the list. He's forced to work side-jobs in the meantime. He doesn't have a schedule. Sometimes he's home and sometimes he isn't. But, when he is home, he's either in bed on his phone or in bed with his girlfriend. He is never on time for anything. He doesn't spend any time with me or my younger siblings. He isolates himself from a family that desperately needs the structure that a parent should provide. 

My mom provided that structure, even though it was through rage. My sister and I were taught respect and discipline because of her. My brother, who is almost ten years younger than me, lives an entirely different life than my sister and I had lived. I'm extremely scared for what his future will look like but it isn't my place or my responsibility to be his mother. I'm enrolled in a 4-year university and live away (physically) from these problems for 9 months a year; I'm trying to figure out how to kindle my own success independently.

She raised me to be strong-willed and have extremely high expectations for myself. She taught me how to respect even those that don't necessarily deserve it and to be polite to strangers and friends alike. My mother taught me how to earn what I get and be grateful for it.

But she didn't ever show me what love felt like. I don't know how parents treat their children. I don't know what it feels like for someone to be involved in my success. I don't have a mother to talk to about my relationships or friendships. I've never even had an appointment with a gynecologist, and was just recently informed that this was even necessary by a friend. Her craziness and anxiety reflect in me. I feel trapped and all I desperately want is to feel like I have a family at home that will be excited to see me when I return from school. 

I understand I'm healthy, happy and doing well for myself despite everything described in this post. I feel selfish and ungrateful complaining at all.  But what can I possibly do to fill this void? I see a therapist regularly, she simply attempts to relate each of my emotional issues to my damaged relationship with my parents. Acknowledgment of the issues is one thing, feeling good about them is another.

21698,Non-Romantic,3h4ato,"So, my parents have crippled my ability to adult pretty severely. Every time I think I'm making strides, something happens to completely obliterate my confidence. 

I'm not trying to blame them for it now, and I try not to be resentful, but it's a fact that there's really no getting around. We come from a very codependent family, and I just don't have the skills I need to be successful as an adult. None of us really do; we spend a lot of time alternating between inflicting ourselves on one another and relying on one another for help. There's a lot of addiction and inability to follow through. Even my parents, who run a decent business, can't keep staff and keep changing their minds about what they want to do. I don't think any of the inability to commit is such a bad thing, but hopefully it will help explain why I find their attitude toward me so perplexing and hurtful. 

Personally, I'm in therapy, and trying to be self-sufficient, but I keep making mistakes, and I have issues with depression and lack of motivation. The main issue right now, though, is that they're still trying to have too much control of my life, and I'm not sure how to break away from it. 

Some background: my parents divorced when I was 5. My mother got custody and my father had visitation rights. My father was not very involved in my childhood, and by the time I became a teenager he was a full-blown alcoholic. He died from that when I was 26. 

When I was young, my mother was an okay parent from what I can remember. But by the time I was 9 or 10 she started having some emotional problems, and from what I understand, a drug problem. She changed a lot and became very abusive and isolating. Eventually, she moved out to a rural area with my brother and I, and started homeschooling us. I had very little social interaction outside of the internet and my immediate family, and she would habitually cut me off from both as a form of punishment. I was raised taking care of a farm she had no idea how to run-- lots of animals died and were neglected, and my brother and I were heavily abused, both physically and emotionally. I won't bother with specific examples, but it was pretty bad. 

The physical abuse stopped when my stepfather entered the picture, but I was expected to continue working for them, which I did, both on the farm and at the aerospace company they started. When I got my first apartment, they paid for it, so I would be closer to their office. I was 'fired' multiple times over various arguments and offenses, both legit and conceived, and the right to have my rent paid withdrawn, so I'd scramble to look for a job, get one, work successfully for a few months… and then go back to them when they stopped being angry and asked me to return to work. I felt obligated, and comfortable/safe that I could do this one job right (except when my mother was angry and suddenly I was a huge fuck up; everyone else who worked for her told me otherwise and I *knew* otherwise). I realize now they were severely damaging my ability to feel secure in a relationship or an occupation.

It was the same with school. I never figured out what I might be interested in and was never forced to be accountable for anything but my mother's whim--meanwhile she would say things like I don't think this is going to make you happy or You're never going to make money this way and I would just lose steam. Even now, I find maintaining the inner-drive for education to be difficult. I've drifted from program to program but nothing's ever stuck. 

As I said, when I was 26, my father died. I was left with a large inheritance. I made some good decisions and some bad ones. I've run through a lot of the money trying to self-medicate and find a place where I belong. The relationship with my mother became even more fraught, with us going NC multiple times because she could no longer threaten me with the loss of a job or financial assistance. I moved to Denver and was doing pretty well, though I was directionless. 

I've tried a couple of different things (culinary school, cosmetology) with the idea that I could get a vocational career under my belt and then figure out where I wanted to go from there, but decided quickly in both cases that it wasn't something I was going to enjoy, and bowed out before a lot of money was spent. I decided I wanted a change of scenery and moved to Florida, where my brother lived, so that I would still have some family in the area but be on my own to learn some independence. I feel like this was the smart thing to do. 

I wasn't speaking to my parents during this time, but renewed contact with them after THEY moved out to Florida as well (no one asked them to do this, they literally followed my brother and I). I ended up right back in the same cycle with them. Working for them, acting as an emotional buffer for my mother, and feeling constant pressure to please them/be with them/act in a manner they find acceptable. The last time it got to be too much, NC happened… until I received a DUI. I called them for bail. It made me realize that no matter how hard I was trying to figure things out, it wasn't good enough because I was still acting on my grief and boredom. So I got myself into therapy and tried to focus on having a relationship with them that involved healthy boundaries, while trying to be proactive about dealing with the DUI. 

I was feeling very positive about all of it and I thought things were going well, but it turns out they were just being more careful about what they said to me. I felt secure enough to tell them what I really wanted to do-- which is pursue a criminal justice and then a funeral sciences degree. I said that might involve moving. The atmosphere shifted-- they'd been really supportive and we were all functioning well as a unit up until then; after, she picked back up her habit of doing things like calling to say she was going to move back to where she came from, and that I was making so many stupid choices in my life and she's sick of bailing me out. 

The thing is, she has a point. I know she has a point. But she uses those points as ammo, she uses her fear as a weapon and an excuse, and it's just so demoralizing. For me, a good day is being able to get out of bed. And I make a lot of excuses, too, and a lot of mistakes. But I'm trying. I start over as many times as I have to. I ask for help. I try to think of others. And I was so pleased with my progress over the past five months. But it's laughable to them, it's pathetic. Success to them isn't try, try again. It's getting it right the first time.

And when I called her out for being manipulative today, it all came pouring out from her and my stepdad both. They told me they think I *need* my hand held in this life and that unless I get married, I'll always need their help. They told me I accuse them of being horrible people and I just need to get over it. They told me they should be able to say anything they are feeling (even if I find it cruel) and that I need to develop a thicker skin. They told me I never finish anything and so they can't be expected to be emotionally supportive. They told me they're worried about me, but it felt so patronizing. They literally told me that they're afraid if I don't take their advice and their help, I'll end up dead. DEAD. I realize that getting a DUI absolutely could have killed me, but it's the first time I have ever been in trouble. I've made other mistakes, everyone does, but have generally been nothing but reliable my entire life. I can say that honestly. And I've been working really, really hard to make the DUI right, to the point where the judge commended me during my plea. 

Anyway, I explained that it's impossible for me to coexist with them and try to be successful when I feel like their love and support are subject to taking their advice and maintaining their idea of a status-quo. All I was looking for was some reassurance that they'd still care if I was a failure. But just kept saying that they 'won't ever bail me out again' if I strike out on my own and get into trouble again.

I don't expect them to! They could have told me when I got arrested that, hey, we love you and we'll be there for you while all this is happening, but we're not getting involved so you'll have to figure something else out. I wouldn't have held it against them-- the only reason I called at all was to ask them to bring my credit card to the station. Instead they went to the bail bonds and did everything, then tried to pretend like it never happened. I'm grateful, but I feel like it's not because they love me, so much as because they want to oversee my life. I don't want that. I want to be responsible for myself. I want to be a fully realized person. I just don't know how to do it, and still be involved with them. I don't know how to live life the way that feels right to me without completely alienating them. I don't know what to do with myself when I get the opportunity. 

Even my brother is telling me, You just need to pick something and do it. And they're right, I know they're right. But I mean… just because they're right, doesn't mean they aren't being assholes about it. I feel as though I've been set up to fail. The something I'm doing right now is trying to figure out why I *keep* failing, and stop it from happening again. 

Here's what I am doing: 
-In therapy every two weeks
-Incorporating healthy diet and exercise to help with my depression
-Trying to learn to differentiate my needs/desires from the need/desire to please my parents

21703,Non-Romantic,3cxfhx,"We've been friends since 15. 4 months ago she left her guy of 6 years as she was over it. They have a kid together. She's been leaving the kid with her ex 5x a week lately and doing loads of drugs (mainly weed, but pills/coke too) and drinking most days. At first she was smoking/drinking when the kid is gone, but now also while he's asleep in her room. She's been doing self destructive stuff like engaging in an affair, thinking about cutting again, and she's had to drop classes as she's started to fail uni.

She recently alluded to having to deal with 'heavy shit' that happened years ago. She always snapchats me while high and she sent me a snap tonight with a pic of her tumblr with the name half scribbled out. It was easy to guess, so I read her tumblr and found out:

* She was raped when she was 12, suppressed it and feelings have just resurfaced (I had an inkling about this)
* She's feeling out of control in her drug use and feels like a shitty mom (she's normally a great mom!)
* She's feeling suicidal and fighting the urge to cut and kill herself.

Do I approach her and mention tumblr? Do I talk to her sister or best friend? There's no use in saying 'hey if you wanna talk I'm here' because she **won't**. I know exactly what she's going through as I went through the same issue last year (break up, was a single mom and suicidal) and I never reached out to anyone as it was horribly embarrassing. She's a proud person, won't admit anything. She even said on her tumblr she knows she can talk to friends but is too stubborn too. I worry if I mention the tumblr I might look like I was invading her privacy, but at the same time, if she only half covered the name of her tumblr, was she secretly hoping I'd find it and look? Is it a cry for help/attention? I can't do nothing if she's suicidal.

21717,Non-Romantic,1o8wp5,"Hi everyone. I'm really frustrated right now and driving myself crazy because my family is so nutty. I'll save you the insanely long story but each one of them has pretty obvious mental issues and none of them will get help. Anyway. They're all older than me - oldest sister is 32, middle sister is 30, brother-in-law is 34, and brother (not really involved) is 29. I have a 5-year-old nephew and a 1-year-old niece as well. This trip was supposed to be for THEM and they are the only reason I agreed to go in the first place.

-----

Basically, my oldest sister (C) had to pay for everyone's tickets - except mine. She does okay in terms of money, but is constantly working in order to stay that way. My brother-in-law (B) of course helps out and also paid. The reason C paid for our sister (S) and my mother is because they both live with her. While my mother is capable, she is retired and waiting to get money from selling our house, so she couldn't pay just yet. That said, she's like my niece and nephew's unpaid nanny, so I feel perfectly fine with the fact that her ticket was paid for. But my sister S is completely dependent and unstable and I don't like that her ticket was paid for at ALL. That said it was C's decision. 

-----

S is crazy in the sense that she is most definitely borderline but refuses to ever get help. She can't do anything by herself, has no money, no job (for over 10 years!) and no motivation. She plans on having my mother pay for her first few months rent on an apartment when my mom gets money from selling the house. Obviously I doubt that'll happen just logic wise because S has the shittiest possible credit (she racked up about 50,000$ in debt six years ago) and hasn't worked in ages. It's just not happening. That's beside the point, though; trust me, I know my whole family enables her and each other and I really hate that fact. But I've said my piece so many times and it makes no difference. 

----

S explodes almost daily. She's been doing this for about 12 years or so. Anyway, now that she's living with C and B and my mom (who she has serious issues with) the explosions happen more and more often. I think it's partly because she's afraid because B wants her to be moved out by Nov 1 - won't happen, but you get the point. B and S butt heads because B doesn't like to stand for her shit, but unfortunately, S has decided that she now HATES B, and tells my sister C all the time. Pissed off about another stupid little thing, S recently started arguing with C about her husband and saying all these mean, awful things as usual. C, given the amount of stress she's under, flips out in return - etc. etc. etc. 

-----

So, after B tried to work things out with S (and failed) both of them went to C and argued with her a ton, both extremely mad. C is super irrational right now and I'm assuming didn't respond/handle the situation very well, because now B and S want to cancel the trip. S in particular says she's absolutely not going.

----

So anyway, my role in this - I agreed to go for my nephew and niece and thought it might be great to spend some time with them. However, for a reason I really don't know, I was asked to pay for myself. It's not as if I couldn't, but because I did that money has been ridiculously tight these past few weeks. And trust me, please, I'm really not trying to act like a brat about it, but I just didn't understand why I was expected to pay for myself while I'm in school full time and working a part-time job and have my own apartment with utilities and rent and etc. while S was completely paid for despite having none of that. Well, I guess it makes sense that way; she needed someone to pay for her and I didn't. Still, frustrating.

----

But now that S has thrown her hands up and is threatening not to go, C is saying that the trip is off entirely. This SUCKS and makes me so angry because I essentially wasted $350 which is a lot considering I'm trying to make ends meet, not buying groceries, and supposed to be saving for a trip in the summer with my BF. I know I can still make all those things happen, but it's just the fact of that money would've helped me out SO much. Ugh. I kind of want to ignore them for a while and if they reach out, just tell them that I'm really angry that they put me in that financial strain and don't seem to care at all, and that I can't take having to deal with their roller-coaster ways and behaviors especially when it goes from affecting me emotionally to affecting me financially. I know I put myself in this situation by buying the ticket, but I really did it with my nephew and niece in mind. I love those kids and wanted to see them happy and having fun. 


Is it immature of me to be angry about this? Is it okay for me to get some distance because I'm pissed at them? I just want to make them realize that it's incredibly selfish to do this to: me, my nephew and niece, and C, who paid for all of them! Course, they don't really speak logic, so I don't know if it's worth it. I'm just so mad. 


Any perspective/opinions would be so appreciated. I'm sure I just need to calm down and try to forget about it, but I would definitely like to know if my feelings are valid or not, and what the next step should be. 

Thank you!!

She used to a smart, funny person, but now all she tells me about is how fat she is and how she has no prospects for a relationship. She has been to a lot of therapists in the last few years. She's been on and off medication and at one point was diagnosed with bi-polar disorder, though there seems to be some question about whether this diagnosis was legitimate.  

I love this person, but she is exhausting to be around these days. She talks constantly about herself and her problems. I cannot get a word in edge-wise and we don't have anything that resembles an actual conversations--just her talking at me. I know she is having a hard time and I have no problem talking with my friends about their problems, but this is just a non-stop monologue about how awful her life is and it's been this way for the last five years or so. It's too much for me. 

I can't be the only person who it is alienating. How can I get her to stop talking about herself and focus on things that are more positive? How can I get her to actually have a conversation with me rather than just verbally vomiting at me for 3 days? I don't think I can speak about this problem with her directly.

21727,Non-Romantic,2u4ia2,"I am thinking of cutting out my family, since they have failed what I made my last straw with them. I will explain as briefly as possible.


My mother and my step-father are toxic, being around them sends me into depression and makes me so angry I can't think. My husband to be has had it with them. Our wedding is in 7 days. They are now in the province with us, and tried to stay in our little house (but they wont impose of course!) with only one bathroom. That's not happening. They're pissed off because they don't want to pay for a hotel, because neither of them have worked for over 5 years. Apparently work is just too stressful.


They were staying with my uncle, but he kicked them out because he couldn't take it. Now they are staying with my grandmother. They are making everything about her and my grandfather, which would be fine, if they had given a shit 2 years ago when everything went downhill. My grandfather has Alzheimers and was recently committed to a hospital because my grandmother couldn't handle him anymore. I've been here the whole time, dealing with it with my uncle, while my parents live in lalaland denying any problem. Now that they're here, everything is about them and how hard it is to deal with my grandparents. 7 days before my wedding. I'm doing my final dress fitting, and get told for the third time that day the story of my grandfather trying to kill himself last week. I get that things are really bad with my grandfather, but do I need to know every detail, at the bridal store? 


They aren't contributing a cent to the wedding, they aren't happy or excited, they're staying in my house on my wedding night so I had to get a hotel, they're pissed that that means they have to take all the decor and presents home with them at the end of the night so they can't drink excessively. They aren't helping me obtain decor, everything is worded as what do we have to do, not how can we help, and I made the gesture to my step-father that he could walk me down the aisle, and he said yes but has made it very visible that he doesn't want to.


This is the last straw for me, they emotionally and physically abused me as a child, left for days at a time when I was younger, moved away from me to the boonies where there was no school when I was 17, and left me to live with my sister, my mom has gotten drunk before and told me she never wanted children, she has gotten so drunk that's she showed me the scars from when she cut herself, the list goes on. I'm so angry that one week before their daughter's wedding it's still about them, and how bad it is that my grandparents are sick, when they havent bothered to visit or help or care except now. I'm angry because they make me feel like a criminal for being happy about getting married, and with them it's almost impossible to be happy.


After the wedding, I am debating letting my relationship with them fade because of their behaviour. Do I have enough reason to, or am I the wrong one here?

Throwaway because I feel like I need a place where I can get this off my chest and look at some solutions to the problem I'm having with my family.

I grew up an only child until I was 18 years old when my brother was born. I was living away from home at the time with my ex, a decision which my mother resented and we still have a somewhat rocky relationship because of this. Anyway my brother was born and everything seemed perfect, my mum (38) and step-dad (40) seemed really happy and my brother was adorable. Soon after, I left to begin university and over the course of the past 2 years it has become clear that my brother has special needs, which at the moment is looking like some type of autism. I keep in regularly contact with my family while I am away at university and know a lot about what is happening with my brother and how he is developing. 

Obviously I am not naive and recognise that this is a massive shock for my parents and something that they have to adjust to, and they have their own feelings about it. However, since I came home for the summer vacation I feel like I have taken on too much of the burden that comes with living and raising an autistic child.

My mother insists on waking me up at 8am most days while I am at home. I usually then spend the morning cleaning and tidying, sometimes babysitting. I often help make lunch for everyone and do things like changing my brother's nappy or entertaining him. In the afternoon my mum expects me to hang out with her doing lame things like watching tv or being on the internet. By the time my brother is in bed and we have our dinner, I don't get time to myself til about 9pm. Of course by then I'm pretty exhausted to really do anything I want to do, such as gaming or watching my shows. I had really been looking forward to having a relaxing summer because I assumed I would be working for a lot of it (didn't have any luck with finding a decent job in my home town) and I am going into my final year at university, which will be very stressful. I sometimes get an hour or two to myself in the day, but I feel like I have to ask permission. If I want a lie in, I have to ask and even then my mum still wakes me up early. If I want a day off from helping, no such thing seems to exist. I was quite poorly these past few days and while I was allowed to spend some time in bed recovering, I was still expected to do some chores and be at my mum's beck and call. 

I've noticed recently my mum doesn't seem to thank me for helping out and doing things, and often takes her negative emotions out on me regarding my brother. She also is quite controlling over how I spend my time. She isn't keen on my boyfriend so I have to ask permission to go and stay at his place, and usually I'm only allowed for about 4 or 5 days. She was angry that my boyfriend had let me borrow his xbox so I'd have some extra things to do in my free time, and has told me I'm not allowed to be on it for more than 2 hours a day. I feel like all this would be fine if I was a kid, but I'm 21 years old and have lived independently before. 

My mum also makes a point that she is letting me stay here for free while I am on summer vacation ( I have said a few times that if I could stay somewhere else then I probably word, not maliciously, just as upfront as I could say it). I never ask my parents for anything, I completely support myself at university and because of this attitude my mum has, I feel like if I was in any kind of trouble, I wouldn't be able to turn to them. 

Now onto my brother. I realise that much of his behaviour is not his fault, and that he IS a toddler after all so he's going to be mischievous. However he can be VERY violent towards me when I am looking after him. He bites, hits, scratches often for no reason. It's a shame because I would love to play and interact with him but he just won't let me do anything with him. Again, it can't be helped but trying to look after him when he won't let me touch him is incredibly difficult. He's also non-verbal, so it means he spends a lot of his time crying loudly because that is how he communicates. I just seem to have a permanent headache from being around him, and I can't imagine how my mum  must feel when she has to take care of him all by herself.

I have tried many times to explain to both my parents how I am feeling and how much the lack of time to myself is getting to me. Of course I am happy to help out around the house and babysit every now and then but it feels like that has just been my entire life for the past few months. I'm finding it more difficult to keep my emotions in check and find myself becoming more resentful of my family. I guess I want to know how unreasonable I'm being, although the couple of friends I have confided in and my own grandmother have all agreed it is too much. I struggle to communicate exactly how I'm feeling because I get upset very easily and lose the thread of what I am trying to say. This is all a bit of a word vomit so if you need any clarification of details or anything, just ask. But please help me Reddit, I don't want to hate my family for something out of their control and I don't want to cause a strain on any relationships. Am I really that awful for feeling how I feel? Sometimes I really do feel like the worst sister and daughter in the world.

My mom got married to K when I was 7 years old after dating K for about 6 months. She and my dad had me at a very young age and never married, and had been apart for ~6 years when K came into the picture. My dad was as present as he could be through the custody battles and his wife's constant moving between states with their children, but he was sadly limited by both the courts and mere time/distance.  

I remember very little from the time they married until I moved out at 14 into my grandma's house, but what I do remember is his alcoholism, and my mom's and my isolation. We never went out with friends or visited family (aside from court ordered visits with my dad), and the phone was only for K's use. My mom had one friend C who she could only visit on specific occasions, and is to this day one of her only friends. I remember my mom with black eyes, and holes in the wall from where K would punch into the drywall and leave his blood splattered there for months, forbidding us to wash it off despite his immaculate expectations we were to conform to for the house.   

When I moved out, it was because K and I had had a huge argument and I used my cell phone my stepmom got me, and called my grandma and told her I was scared and angry, and 15 minutes later my grandpa, uncle, and dad all showed up at the door and watched as I packed a night bag and left, with K sputtering and fuming in his recliner with a beer in his hand.  

I came back the next day with my mom while K was at work, so I could visit my mom and my cat, and she stalled me for so long that K came home from work and tried to force me into isolation again, using my young brother (~4yo) as ransom almost. I was 14 by then, and refused to obey his absurd rules (K had me on a workout routine where he'd watch me do 120 pushups a night and 60 crunches, in addition to a couple hours of chores and fetching him beers), and so I walked outside and waited until she came out to the car and drove me home with Say What You Need to Say playing on the radio as we stopped on the way to grandma's to pick up an 18 pack of beer for K. My mom said nothing during the encounter with K, she just watched K speak and then watched me leave before following after a couple minutes. My mom packed my things up the next day and brought them to me at my grandma's house, I never went back to mom's house again. Until now.  


**The present:**   
I'm a senior in college and I came home to work for the summer with my SO. My mom has a nice house, and with a downstairs that she needs to rent out to help pay the bills, and she offered to let me stay there if I'd help out with money. I agreed, and she assured me that K was alright with this (my SO and I residing together in her house). So far, my SO and I have been here about 2 weeks and in that time I've seen again how he speaks to her (degradingly, manipulatively) and how he considers himself the head of the household despite the fact that his name is nowhere on any papers but the marriage certificate, and he pays few bills (mostly he spends his cash on alcohol and cigarettes), leaving my mom to work 2 jobs and care for their son (now 11) and for the house.   

Yet with all my mom struggles to do, he degrades her and speaks to her like she is an idiot, and disregards all her efforts. K calls me Little, though I've asked him politely not to many times. I overheard them arguing today and K said that my SO and I were wastes of space and electricity and he never wanted us here, that my mom was such a fucking idiot for allowing us to stay here and that we are the cause of all their financial troubles.

21769,Non-Romantic,3agyi0,"A friend of mine (17F referred to as Jane) had her first boyfriend (17M in the title referred to as Sam). They dated from November to February. I only met Sam at a party that Jane was at in January as he goes to a different school than Jane and I. I was relayed their conversations frequently and Sam and I were both aware of each others presence without having met each other yet.


At the party, we became good friends very quickly. We messaged on Facebook and he quickly became my best friend. Our conversations were long and I really enjoyed them. It was nice as I have few friends that I message frequently as I moved countries two years ago, but I didn't have such widespread conversations as Sam and I did. Even messaging Jane, I was always given short answers and she never initiated conversations unless she wanted something.


Now in February, I family member of mine passed away in my home country so I had to quickly return back there for a week and I was quite fragile. I received a few messages of condolences from friends, but the only person who really put in an effort to see how I was feeling was Sam. He messaged me often and we had some of our usual conversations and it really lifted up my spirits. I only received one message from Jane after I had been gone for a few days- Sam had broken up with her. It was a shock and I tried to comfort her but it felt like she was only now messaging me to have her confidence boosted. 


After a few days of hearing both sides of the story (Sam broke up with her because she was too 'intense' for him) , Jane asked me to stop speaking to Sam. It would really mean a lot to me if you'd stop speaking to him. But it's up to you. I guess I did the wrong thing by keeping talking to him but I was not going to ignore messages from someone who was actually helping me to stay positive and felt genuine.


Back at school, the break up had definitely taken its toll on Jane as she was visibly very upset. She asked if I was still speaking to Sam and not wanting to lie to her, I told her the truth that I still was. She avoided me at school, which I guess I don't blame her for, and she began to look worse and worse. Eventually we talked it out and I promised to stop messaging him, not wanting to send her spiralling down. Sam and i messaged twice more, both times initiated by him and I gave short answers where i could to try end threads quickly. It has now been two months since we last spoke.


Our school year has ended and Jane is changing schools next year. We were friends but never much more then speaking to each other at school or hanging out every few months. Although I've known her longer, I still consider Sam to be the person I want to know in the long run and feel as though when we don't go to the same school, we won't stay friends. I want to start speaking to Sam again but I don't know how to go about doing it after I pretty much ignored him.


I also want to add that I was worried it might have been my fault that they broke up but I decided that that was just me being a bit egotistical by bringing myself into it. But I did feel like that's how Jane felt as I found out that I was the only one out of  the friends from our school that she had asked to stop speaking to him. We have intersecting friend groups so it is a bit likely that if we were to start speaking again Jane would find out and I don't want her to react badly to that, but now that I no longer have to face her everyday I feel as though it won't matter as much?

My parents divorced in 2004 when I was in fourth grade. My father had an ego trip and my mom was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia about three years later. They remarried in 2010, after my father manipulated my mother into doing lots of things. My mother relies on him a lot now. She's not a vegetable, but it takes her a while to understand things sometimes. She's really well-educated though, and she shines through some moments, it's really beautiful. 

**Conflict**
I butt heads with my dad a lot. I see through his bullshit and I call him out when he tries to con my mom. He has done very bad things to my family. 

Today, we went grocery shopping and I saw that my father swiped a card and it said EBT, FOOD STAMPS - $130. And then he swiped a credit card and it covered the rest of the balance.

I asked to view the receipt (I want to make sure we weren't charged twice for something) and saw that it said ONLINE FOOD STAMPS at the bottom of the receipt totaling to $130. I told my mom and she didn't believe me. She asked for the receipt and saw it too and asked my father and he said that the receipt was advertising the savings if we used food stamps.

Seriously? We live in one of the wealthiest counties in the United States - why would a major supermarket advertise welfare benefits at the bottom of a receipt? She won't believe me and now they are both ganging up on me, calling me stupid and uneducated.

21793,Non-Romantic,2uxlv4,"**PEOPLE BACKGROUND:** My brother (13) and I (24) have always been fairly close. Our dad is only vaguely in the picture; he hasn't lived with us for a couple years now and was seriously mentally unhinged when he was living there. He comes by on some weekends to take my brother to movies and stuff - little outings, that kind of thing. He's a flake and cannot be counted on for shit. Our mom works from home.

My brother is homeschooled through an online K to 12 school program. His house is kind of isolated, so there really aren't neighbors he sees. He pretty much only gets out for Boy Scouts once a week or so. His only social interaction is with assholes he's met through Steam. I go to school a couple hours away and come up for a few days at a time every month or so, plus all the long breaks. We talk through text and stuff occasionally, but lately just when he wants access to our Steam shared library.

**RELATIONSHIP BACKGROUND:** Our mom is great, but she's kind of...conservative. Very what I don't know won't hurt me. Our sister (21) goes to college much further away than I do. So, my brother and I have a kind of unique relationship. I gave him the basic sex talk when he was ten or eleven, for instance. Included in that was that he could ask me any kind of questions he has, and I won't make fun of him or tell our mom.

That went pretty well, and we had a great line of communication for a while. But now he's *thirteen,* and 13YO's are just...the worst. He communicates almost entirely in grunts. He literally flees conversation. He's gotten very wrapped up in his sense of pride and dignity - you know, going *mooooooooom!* at just about everything. He pretty much cannot be spoken to.

**CURRENT SITUATION:** I'm not stupid. I know he watches porn. His computer (which is his and his alone) is in the basement, our mom works on the top floor, there is an *entirely empty floor* between them. I watched porn in much more precarious situations. Couple that with how awful he is at internet safety (one time he came upstairs and told me he found out why it was so slow: this free tool he downloaded told him he had 93 viruses!! wow!!!), and I didn't have trouble putting two and two together when his last computer died way too early.

Also, I get called in to fix it, and on at least one occasion I've opened up Chrome and the most visited pages pop up. I am scarred forever. He got a new computer last fall and it's already been in the shop twice for mysterious viruses.

Also, he's the MOST TRANSPARENT about his masturbation habits. Kid, no one takes forty-minute showers in which they fail to shampoo their hair. Also, once (and only once, God, oh God, I can't unsee, I changed your diapers, why is this happening to me) I opened the door to his room because I suspected he snuck his DS into bed with him. He had not. Here's the kicker: his door was unlocked. It wasn't even *latched*.

Also...he's been throwing out his underwear rather than putting it for my mom to wash. My mom made some comment about his underwear disappearing, because she keeps having to buy more.

I love my brother, but he is a fucking *idiot*.

I have no problem with him watching porn, for the record. I have a problem with him chucking his college fund away purchasing bottomless new computers that he's nuked with skeevy porn site malware. And I feel like if he knew how very obvious he was being, he'd be mortified. Like, the only reason I don't look back on my own very similar teenaged habits and feel mortified and sure everyone knew what I was doing is because no one assumes girls masturbate or have any interest in porn. (HA. Joke's on you, and fanfiction.net is malware-free.) I would like to spare my brother that feeling of looking back and being crushed with retroactive cringe.

More importantly, I'm concerned about our mom figuring out what I did. It's not going to be the end of the world, but it'll sure as hell feel like it to a 13YO boy who fears embarrassment more than death. I know how our mom feels about porn. She would almost definitely see this as a problem that needs addressing. He will lose access to his computer, which is all he does all day. His every hobby is produced by Valve. It wouldn't be out of character for our mom to make an appointment with our church family therapist for my brother to go see and talk about his porn addiction. Yes, there is a family therapist at our church who specializes in tackling porn addiction, and he is friends with our mother.

**MY DILEMMA:** How the *hell* do I bring this up with the kid when he will actively flee any attempt I make at human contact, especially when he realizes what I'm talking about? I've seen parents and older brothers on Reddit talking about they left a note or something to their teenaged son/brother with lists of sites that won't melt your computer. That's within the realm of possibility, but I'm worried about overstepping. I'm not his parent, after all, and our mom would definitely flip *eleven shits* if she found out I'd sent him porn sites. Plus, I feel like it might actually be more embarrassing for him if it's sort of an unspoken secret than if we actually talk about it either face-to-face or text-to-text.

---   
**TL;DR**: My kid brother has destroyed one computer with porn, is working on a second, and is the most obvious masturbator in the world. It's only a matter of time before our mom realizes what's up, and she will be much less accepting of it than I am.

As time passed, we became good friends and were hanging out regularly, in groups or maybe just us 2 (walking around town, the mall, watching tv). All this time she was in a relationship with one guy in that group (good friend of mine), so nothing romantic going on between us.

After about 6 years of their relationship, those two break up. A few months after that, she gets in a relationship with another guy (who she met before her breakup). From there, I never did hang out with her again; whenever I'd ask her to hang out, she'd reply sure ill get back to you and nothing after that. She later replied to a message of mine on how she needed to cut ties with her old life or something; she unfriended a lot of people on FB (went from like 60+ mutual friends with her, to only 1)

About 2 years later (present day), I see her commenting on some old FB pics, then sending friend requests to some people including me. Going against my inner voice telling me to just not bother, I sent her a text asking what made her come back to her old life.

21812,Non-Romantic,3apg0s,"Hey guys, long-time lurker, first-time poster. Looking for thoughts or advice on this weird situation I'm in.

So about a week ago, I (M21) went to visit a friend for her birthday, and planned on staying at another good friend (F20) of mine's (we'll call her Rachel) house for the night. Surprisingly, the friend whose birthday it was didn't get super smashed, but Rachel got pretty drunk although not blackout. As I was helping her into bed and heading to the couch, she kept tugging at me and pulling me with her. So, I figured I'd just get in bed with her if that's what it took to get her to sleep. And before I knew it, she started kissing me, and we made out for a long time. She ended up not wanting to have sex and we just fell asleep eventually.

In the morning, things were a little awkward between us. We've been basically best friends for 3 years, but something like this has never happened before. Thankfully, we just got lunch and it wasn't too awkward, so I just sort of figured it was a one-time thing.

A few days later after non-awkwardness, she texts me about it. Apparently, she didn't remember some of the details of our hookup and that it bothered her. In her words, she felt like I had an upper hand because I remembered all of it, including what she looked like naked, and she didn't really. So after a few more awkward texts, we tentatively agreed to hook up again the following Thursday when there was another friend's birthday party (gotta love everyone's huge 21st birthday celebrations this time of year...).

This past Thursday rolls around, and it basically goes as expected. She doesn't get as drunk this time, neither do I, and we hook up. Pretty much the same as last time: lots of making out and groping, no sex. Same semi-awkward encounter in the morning, but everything else was basically the same in our friendship as before we hooked up.

Problem is, at this point, I'm starting to really enjoy this, and I kind of want to continue this with her. I've never really thought of her this way before, but now that it's happened twice, I want it to happen again just to see what it might become. The only thing is, she is literally the worst person ever at expressing her feelings, because I tried to ask her about it the morning after both times and she just avoided it. Seems like the only time she's open is when she's drunk.

A bunch of our friends are having a smaller party tonight, and I asked Rachel if I could stay at her place again, and she said maybe it'd be best if I crashed with the friends hosting the party. Based on that, I'm assuming she doesn't feel the same way I do.

In the simplest way I can put it: what should I do? Forget it ever happened (like she apparently has)? Tell her how I feel and see what happens? Wait until we both get drunk again? Honestly, I'm not super worried about our friendship because we've been through a lot together and I really don't think even something awkward like this would separate us.

This is my first retail job and when I first started working I was a total noob however, during the last few months the managers have taken a notice of my work and attitude and I have been promoted to be the store trainer; basically I will train new hires (duh) but I will also have supervisor duties such as managing my team, making sure people aren't screwing around, you guys know the drill. I start my official training in a few days but my managers have told me to show leadership and to learn to be more authoratative, which I admit is a bit hard since I'm pretty friendly with everyone and I'm pretty laid back.  I just ask people nicely to do their job and I always thank my coworkers for their work. 



On to my coworker, she started a few months before and she was a cashier. At the store, you pretty much do one thing; if you're a cashier you're a cashier and if you're a sales associate you're on the floor, very little cross trading happens. However, she had been having problems with discrepancies and attitude as a cashier, so she was moved to the floor, which she was not happy about. When I found out I was pretty excited as we were good work friends and she could work with me on the floor. That excitement was for naught. From day one, it was clear she did not want to be there and has not been a team player. She talks back a lot and doesn't listen, she interrupts people when they are telling her what to do. She likes to wander off from her section even though the store is very strict with who stays where. She pushes a lot of the work she needs to do on other coworkers. 



I told her I got promoted and she did not seem very happy. And there have been a few instances in which I nicely reminded her of certain things she need to do and she always talks back to me and then just walks away with her hands in the air, in a very dismissive way. 



For example I was just reminding her of our policies regarding potential shoplifters; pretty much you provide them great customer service to let them know that you're aware of them. She had been following some potentials around the store even though our security was keeping tabs on them, I simply asked her if she had greeted them and asked them if they needed help and she told me no that had not done that and that the other sales associates we were aware of them. I had asked her if she had done that because while she was following these people around there were other things that needed to be done, I would have been fine if she was actually interacting with them per procedure but she wasn't doing anything proactive. (I didn't tell her this, I kept these thoughts to myself) After this exchange she once again left me without saying anything. 



A few moments later she comes up to me, while I'm busy doing something, and tells me I understand that you're trying to show leadership or whatever but you don't need to tell me what to do, I know what I need to do, I just nodded and told her that's fine and she walked away. I was actually pretty angry and I had to leave the floor to cry thug tears in the bathroom. When I got back on the floor she acted like nothing had happened and started chatting about random things.

We're planning a holiday (for in December) and it's mostly the same: the accommodation, flights, etc. everything is split equally. However, when I was talking to my mother about our plans, she got upset at the fact that he was not covering the basic costs like our hotel. I questioned her about it and I'm guessing this thinking stems from outdated, traditional Asian thinking that the guy should pay more. She started making disparaging remarks about him and discouraging me from further dating him (she has always had neutral opinions on him). We got into an argument and I don't know what to do.

Has anyone had similar experiences or what can I say to make my mother come round and out of her outdated thinking?

21827,Non-Romantic,2np8g3,"A little backstory: I've been with my SO, Mark*, for this entire year. Which I know isn't much, but we've both had rocky histories with past relationships and found that we clicked due to knowing exactly what we wanted and finding it in each other. We differ majorly in political and religious views, but it's never once been an argument; ie, neither have gotten angry or had hurt feelings over the others' view. He's got 2 kids from a previous relationship, and I'm 3 months pregnant with my first, his third. The pregnancy was planned. We both have middle-class-paying jobs that are steady. Both families approve (except my mother--because we're not married--but she's mostly quiet about it).

So the issue: He has this long-time friend, Garrett*. Garrett bothered me right off the bat; not in a creepy way. He's overly protective of Mark. The first time I met him he said, Seriously, if you ever hurt him, I'll make your life hell. I know Garrett has some personal issues, such as struggling with depression and thinking he shouldn't have to change himself.

He takes the latter point to extremes. Like he won't even change his attitude to keep his job, because he shouldn't have to conform to everyone else. At the same time, he is utterly disrespectful of anyone else doing anything that doesn't conform to his wants/needs. Like, if we all play Cards Against Humanity, he moans and complains every time someone plays a depressing card. (Which always depends on context, but... he's aware of how the game works, too.)

The second time I ever hung out with Garrett, it was with Mark and Garrett's wife. Now, I have a mean-spirited sense of humor. Most people pick up on it quickly; it's not been much of an issue, even with Mark's parents (and his mother is, seriously, the sweetest woman alive). I'll playfully smack him in the chest for tickling me, or say something to the effect of, Sweetheart, knock it off before I beat your face in. I never follow through, it's always said with a smile, and Mark happens to think it's cute (he says it's like a kitten trying to sound like a lion).

I said something similar to Mark while the four of us were hanging out, and Garrett immediately jumped on me saying, No. Shut up. Don't you ever disrespect him again. At the time I just apologized and tried to move on, but Garrett was on me all night. Any time I made any vaguely disparaging remark, I was disrespecting Mark. Asking Mark about it later, I asked him if it really was bothering him, because Garrett has known him much longer and maybe I was missing something and actually hurting his feelings. Mark just shrugged and said, Garrett's just like that. He's overprotective.

And that's been the excuse any time Garrett has been rude to me. He's just like that.

Mark says I have to stand up to Garrett. And this is conflicting. I don't just roll over and take it, but I also know he has a violent temper (I don't think toward women, but I'm not willing to test it). He's a big dude, probably at least twice my size and weight. Also, the only times we've ever hung out with him, it's at my SO's house (I live here and pay rent, but on paper it's all his). so I try to play the polite host, but it seems like every time I see him he has something rude to say. Like the last time he came over, his wife said she wanted hard cider, which we didn't have any of. Before I can even do anything, Garrett says, Well, make wthmadness go to the store and get some. Oh, and garlic bread, too. I did my best to just smile and go along with it, and Mark *says* Garrett felt bad while I was gone for making me go, but I've never seen this personally.

Yesterday Garrett found out I'm pregnant. We told all our families over the week. I told my friends, Mark didn't say much to his. As a rule, he's pretty introverted, so even with his parents he only told them because I pointed out I was going to start showing within a few weeks and it would be better they were told rather than figuring it out. Well, his sister made an announcement on her FB, which apparently Garrett saw. So he called Mark and wanted to see him that night. Mark handed the phone to me, said Garrett wanted to talk, and Garrett said, Are you really ready to be a mom? and I told him, Well... as ready as I'll ever be, I guess. I know I'm in good, experienced hands. He got quiet and said, Put Mark back on.

It's hard to explain, but Garrett's tone was so off-putting. 100% of his concern is for Mark, and that's fine, but I've never given him *any* reason to think I'd do anything weird or sketchy. Mark's house is in his name, and if/when he buys a new one before we're married, it will *remain* in his name. Likewise, if we buy my parents' house from them, it will be in my name until we're married. I don't police his money, we split the bills and chores fairly, I get along with Mark's kids fantastically (I think--they say they love me every weekend they see me and they seem to like my attention).

Either way, Garrett and his wife came over, and from the get-go he was moping. Which is whatever; I told Mark I was going to play video games for a bit before bed, and I agreed to stay up a bit later so he and Garrett could socialize. Well, I'm still feeling some fatigue from the first trimester (not as much, yay!), so within a couple hours I excused myself and went to bed. Garrett and his wife stayed for another 2 1/2 hours. I was constantly waking up because Garrett is just naturally a loud dude. Again, I didn't come out of the room and say anything, because I'd said I didn't mind if they come over, and I know Garrett and Mark don't physically see each other very often. But it irritated me that I explicitly said I was tired, and the TV was blasting YouTube videos punctuated by Garrett's talking for the rest of their visit. I still need to talk to Mark about it, but I'm waiting until the kids go to bed tonight.

I guess I'm just wondering if there's anything I can do to ease this? Am I taking too much offense over some minor incidents? To be fair, we only see him once every 1-2 months, so it's not like he's a constant presence. But when he is around, the bear claws come out and I just honestly can't recall a single meeting with him where he was deliberately rude. And I'm pretty sure it's not mean-spirited, because he looks angry half the time he says these things to me.

So is this nothing? Should I even be pressing this issue? Should I write it off as just how my SO's close friend is? Am I being the typical overdramatic pregnant woman? I could use some outside perspective.

21869,Non-Romantic,2dkuzj,"Hello, I have know idea how long this will be, sorry in advance. Let me give you some background. Right now I have a girlfriend, things are good and I love her. I've told her about the issue with my ex and says she wouldn't mind if I sealed things, as long as it was non romantic of course.

On to the actual background of why I want to connect with my ex. When I first started dating her over 3 years ago, February of 2011, my Dad was very ill from cancer and losing the battle. He died in March of 2011. I had no hope of the relationship because it wasn't like my Dad was sick for very long, he didn't have much longer after diagnosis, so it was a lot to swallow in a few month span. I thought I was going to be a wreck and want nothing to do with a relationship, but it turned out to be a great relationship for over a year. Things were good with her and I and she really helped me move passed my father. I will honestly tell you that I don't know how I would have ended up with out her. 

A year after, we started to go our separate ways and want different things so I ended it and I feel it was mutual. We didn't hold much contact after breaking up and it wasn't the nicest breakup ever, but it wasn't horrific or abusive in any way. We broke up February of 2012. 
On my fathers 1 year death anniversary, she texted me telling me she is still so sorry that my father passed and wanted me to know that she's there and everything. I straight up told her to go fuck herself and didn't want anything to do with her. Since then, I've learned a hard lesson that nice people, and people being nice is a rarity and the fact that she was simply reaching out to me to let me know how sorry she was, and how I reacted, made me feel like shit. It still does, I know she's probably moved on from that day that I said that, but I've been thinking about it and that was one of the last times I've talked to her and I still feel bad. She did some not so nice things to me after that so I didn't feel so bad at the time but we are a little older than we were then and I just feel like an asshole still. 

I don't want her in a romantic way, I don't miss her in any way. I love my girlfriend and am happy with the way things are now. I just would simply explain myself and move on from it whether she would respond or not. This wouldn't be an attempt to be friends or anything. So, is this the right thing? Or should I just move on from it?

TL;DR: My father died when my ex and I first started dating, ended up dating a year beyond that before breaking up. After breaking up she reached out to say she was still sorry about my father passing and I told her to go fuck herself.

21870,Non-Romantic,34d6pe,"My father and I were never best friends, my parents split when I was 4 and I was shuttled between their houses every weekend my whole life. Eventually my dad married my step mom, a horrible woman I have never gotten along with, and moved 45 minutes away for them to raise her horses on a farm.
By the time I was 17, I knew to hide certain parts of my life from my dad, he was slightly conservative but after marrying my stepmom got far worse and much more judge mental. I couldn't tell him about my gay friends, any parties, or basically anything about my day to day life without upsetting him. Then one day I get wind of the fact that he found my myspace page, or what I suspect is more likely, his assistant found it and showed him. He saw and read some things he did not agree with and we got into a very, very nasty fight via email. We each said some regrettable things, a few below the belt punches, and stopped talking. My family pressured me to apologize and call him but I never could. It sounds stupid, starting from MySpace, but we said some really terrible things to each other. 
A few years pass, and I decide to try and work it out, I email an apology, and he emails a barrage of insults and back handed compliments wrapped in guilt. 
This happens two more times before I give up, that was at least 5 years ago. Today, my brother is working for our dad at my dads painting company, and for weeks we have been hearing how insufferable my dads been as a boss and what a jackass he's been. But tonight, I got a call from my brother informing me that the current job has bankrupt dad, he's in debt up to his eyeballs, the business is dead as of Friday and has mentioned to my brother suicidal thoughts. All of this on top of the fact that he's going through with a divorce from my stepmom.
My brother pressured me into calling him, saying I may regret it if he's gone soon or I will miss out on things. I'm not sure how I feel. On one hand, I made peace with never having a relationship with my dad years ago, but on the other I feel guilty and terrible for his problems and for not being there for him. I don't know what good, if any, a phone call from me would do. Yes I'm his daughter and I feel an obligation to him, but I also just keep thinking of the last time(s) I apologized. My father is not a kind man, my whole life he harped on me being overweight and nit picking anything he could think of about me. He is downright frightening when angry, and I really don't want to hear what choice words he would have over my tattoos.

21876,Non-Romantic,3g3wai,"Fair warning, this is a long story. There’s a lot of background that I feel needs to be included in order to understand the full scope of the story. I first became friends with Vince in one of my college semesters a couple of years ago, and he was a great guy. He’s always cracking jokes, being positive, and generally being an awesome dude to hang out with. Well, a couple months ago, my friends and I needed another person for our Werewolf (tabletop roleplaying game) campaign, so I suggested Vince! He was going through a rough time in his life, and I felt that he needed some friends to keep him company. He joined, and then we all started noticing that he had some strange habits. 

For one, he lies about almost everything. I’m not exaggerating when I say that. I was talking about how I really wanted to visit Germany one day, and suddenly, he had lived in Germany until he was fifteen, yet he told me prior to this that we went to the same middle school, which was in the United States. I mean, it was petty things that didn’t even make sense to lie about, and it just kept going and going. We worked out that if something got him attention, he would lie to gain attention (for example: one time we were commenting about how we really liked dogs and were having a discussion about the best doggies to have, and he suddenly had a kennel in his backyard where he cared for a bunch of different dogs, even though we’ve been to his house, and he doesn’t have a dog. He can’t because his parents are allergic. Another example: we were talking about different types of special brew beer, and suddenly he was a brew expert, even though prior to this he said he never touched alcohol). We all started questioning what was real and fake in this dude’s life. Then, we all started getting kind of annoyed, but I was concerned. I wanted to make sure he was okay. Was this a plea for attention? I didn’t know, but I was suddenly elected to speak with him about his lying. I guess because my friends think I’m good at words or something.

I talk to him, and I am as cautious as possible. I explain that I’m worried for him and ask him if he’s alright. He explains that he’s going through a rough time at his job, something about maybe being fired. I then ask him about the lying. I don’t exactly know how I phrased it, but I said something like, “Hey, I’ve kind of noticed that you’re telling little fibs here and there. Are you sure you’re alright? Like, I’m here for you, here to help with whatever you need. That’s what friends are for.” He gets kind of standoffish and says everything is fine and that he’s just going through a rough patch. I said that my house was always open to him, and if he ever needs someone to talk to, I’m more than happy to listen. Everything seems to end okay, and he even said thank you and that it was sweet of me.

The following week, he ignored me completely. Even when we were at the table playing this tabletop RPG, he ignored me. He didn’t say anything to my character, and he made sure to cut me off any time I tried to speak. I may have imagined it, but I feel like I didn’t. This pattern of ignoring me continued through the next two weeks, so for three weeks, he made sure to keep this up. Even when we were all playing games and talking on Vent (online talking program, like Skype), he made sure to talk over me and interrupt me. The fucked up part is none of my friends said anything! They pretended like it wasn’t happening. I was, and still am, a little hurt by that. I banned him from my vent server, and my friends thought that I had gone too far. I was hurt and angry, and I really didn’t want to be around him or talk to him because I didn’t want to make the situation worse by saying something stupid. He then turned that against me, complaining to everyone else and saying that I hated him and whatnot, which made my friends try to get me to allow him back in because they didn’t want to deal with him anymore.
He finally apologizes (only because one of the friends [21F] in the group basically told him that he needed to), and it was a half assed apology. He lumped me and my friends together in a group message on Facebook and said he was sorry and then listed reasons why his life was shitty. It essentially turned it into a pity party! It was ridiculous. I just accepted the apology because I wanted it to be done with since it was finals week, and I really already had too much stress. 

For the past month, I’ve been trying to be cordial to him and act like I don’t dislike him, but I really do. I haven’t called him names the whole time, and I’ve been as nice as I can be, but he’s always snippy with me. I can’t get over this feeling of hatred towards him because of how he treated me. I opened up to him and called him one of my close friends, something that I don’t do often because I am rather self-conscious. Then, barely a week ago, I’m in another Vent server (a mutual friend’s server), and he pops in. Suddenly, there’s loud feedback when he tries to speak, and he accuses me of sabotaging him. I told him that maybe he should check his settings because I had been in there fine and not causing loud noises. He then says, “Whatever” and tries to drag the mutual friend away from me to play a separate game without me (this mutual friend [23M] is finally back from a long vacation, and we were catching up). I just ended up leaving because Vince would just talk over me and ignore me when I spoke with the mutual friend. This has resurged this hatred and made me wish that I had never befriended him.

On top of this, he’s rooming with my friend David (22M), and he says that he’s tried to talk to Vince, but Vince won’t budge. He thinks that I’m in the wrong and that there’s no point to fixing the friendship because I dislike him.

Now… finally, to the end: Am I in the wrong? Did I deserve this? Am I overreacting? I feel that I might be because my friends are acting like nothing happened. They feel that we should just get along and that I should forgive him. I tried approaching him numerous times, but he ignored me every single time I tried to patch things up. On top of that, he’s done this before. I spoke with a few of his ex-friends, and after they told him something he didn’t want to hear, he stopped speaking with them. I have no idea how I should proceed with this because I don’t want to cause a problem with my other friends, and they seem to be perfectly fine with how things are, but I feel so strained because Vince keeps popping back in and acts like a passive aggressive puppy to me and those around me. There are so many little things that have built up that I have stressed myself out too badly, and if there are any questions, I will be more than happy to answer. Please help. What do I do?

TL;DR: I spoke to Vince about his constant lying, and he ignored me for weeks. Things finally came to a head when he apologized over Facebook by lumping me together with my friends in a group message and saying sorry while acting like he was the victim. He is also extremely passive aggressive and will try to garner attention and pity in any way he possibly can. My friends feel like I should get over this and patch things up (already tried, but he ignored me), and they think that both sides are being stupid, even though they will constantly say how annoyed they are with him. I feel like he’s the one acting like a child. He’s been known to act like this in the past. I want to drop him, but I don’t want to cause a bigger strain on my other friendships. Am I overreacting?

21890,Non-Romantic,2lmdy8,"Sorry if this is kind of long but I think a little bit of background is needed for this. My parents are ministers for a quite strict church, and have been for most of my life (they had some rules stopping my mum from working for them until I was about 7, and when they were repealed my parents both went into the ministry). As part of this, my older brother (22M), my younger sister and I have moved around a lot and were always dragged along to church functions to play nice with the other kids etc etc. 

As we got older, my brother and I both got part time jobs and lots of hobbies etc. which pulled us away from church activities. It also pulled us away from our parents - and it wasn't until this happened that I realised just how narrow and controlling their lifestyle was. The church my parents belong to don't drink, smoke, gamble (I'm talking we weren't allowed to buy raffle tickets at the school fete), or do anything that could be corrupting to the mind, body or soul. They have a strict dress code (including a uniform for sunday worship) and have their own huge number of extra-curricular activities that keep the kids busy with other kids of the same belief system. 

My brother and I now no longer go to church, but we have both left home (me for college; my brother has already graduated) and so our parents leave the fact we have lost our way well enough alone... but my sister is so scared of disappointing my parents that she is basically living her life to please them. Because she's the baby of the family, my mum is desparate to keep a hold of her and to keep her pure and good. My sister doesn't even actually believe in god... but still keeps going to church, helping at the creche, etc etc to keep my parents happy. 

So now we get to the crux of the matter. My sister is a senior in high school this year and has started looking at college applications. I've been helping her look at schools. The problem is two-fold; First, she really wants to study English Lit, but my parents want her to go into law. And she's really struggling to stand up to them and do what SHE wants, rather than what my dad thinks is a solid degree. He was a science major and see's english lit as a wishy washy subject (which I think is bullshit, but that's beyond the point.) Second, she's been so sheltered from so much of normal life that she is SCARED to go to college because she doesn't know how to handle herself socially; she ended up calling me last night to tell me that she is applying to study law at MY school because then she can live with me and avoid all the drunken party boys at dorms.

I'm really scared that my sister is going to end up picking a school she doesn't want and a course she doesn't want, and she's going to hate it and miss out on the college experience. Changing majors is hard at my school, and I don't want her to commit to something she won't enjoy. How can I help her tell my parents what she really wants to do? And how can I convince her to give dorms a chance so she doesn't miss out?

21892,Non-Romantic,2t0whb,"Hi all! First time poster so sorry if there are any mistakes. I took a snowboard lesson a few days ago and my instructor and I got along really well. We exchanged numbers at the end of the day and made plans to hang out. I could tell from the beginning he might have had ulterior motives because during the lesson he asked about my relationship status (just got out of a 5 year/abusive towards the end/not looking for anything for a while) he seemed to understand. He texted me a lot that night trying to make plans for things as big as road trips together. I felt uncomfortable with that and told him would just be happy going boarding together at the local resort. He was fine with that but also threw in a we will see what the future holds.
We hung out with his sister in law and I helped played with his nephew and it was only day two but I had a good time. Day three comes around and he get a little touchy. Hugging me whenever and leaning his head on me. I was pretty uncomfortable with this and later that day he texted me telling me he was very attracted to me and wanted to kiss me. I reminded him I wasn't looking for anything like that and was just happy being friends. Another well see what the future holds is thrown out.
A few more days go by running in to him around the resort. Tension seems to have worn off. We mention meeting again in a few days. I had been bumming rides off him to the mountain but I had come into possession of my own wheels for the time being. So then conversation occurred via text.

21929,Non-Romantic,2gu4xy,"Okay, so to start I feel I should make it known that I am 16 hours from home. I've also had very bad relationship experiences (I was volleyballed back and forth between groups of friends for 3 years followed by losing a best friend due to something her cousin said and losing a best friend to a boy which was then followed by transferring schools and deciding to be anti-social the next ~3 years). 


A month ago I moved away to college. During Orientation a month earlier, I made friends with two different girls (S and R). We swapped numbers and I texted with them both a few times afterwards. Flash forward to the first 10 days of school, they moved into the same dorm, I became close to their 3rd roommate because I spent a lot of time with them. 


Now, I'm an introvert- I adore my alone time and need it to recharge. So one weekend I kind of pulled away... and it's been downhill since then. It wasn't so bad at first, but lately it's gotten worse. We live in different dorms, so we don't exactly see each other very often unless we actively try to do so. 


Lately I've realized that I'm the one who initiates any contact unless we're in class/waiting for class together (R &amp; I have 1 class together, S &amp; I have classes that meet right next to each other so we normally see each other for 5 minutes before those classes start). They're busy, I get it. They both have recently gotten into fragile new relationships, so they need alone time with their SO. That's fine. 


Anyway, today threw me for a loop and got me very upset. I know I should talk to them, but I avoid confrontations at all costs and get severe anxiety when it comes to confronting someone about stuff like that. (Also: due to my previous friendships, I'm very... wary of new people. I'd even go so far as to say I get paranoid of people not liking me and just hanging out with me out of pity). 


So tonight- We were at a new club meeting and at the end as we're leaving, R [18] was talking about going to her gf's apartment to hang out/do shots. Okay cool. We get to their dorm and R &amp; I go inside and hang out in the lobby while S [19] and her GF C [21] along with another friend T [18] go around to the side (although I didn't know this is where they were at first) of the building to smoke. We're sitting there for ~7 minutes doing nothing (R was on her phone texting, I'm just sitting doing nothing) when R tells me that she's just going to go lay down and sleep. Okay. So we both get up, however instead of going upstairs she goes to the side door. I walk out the back door thinking maybe S, C and T were out back. They're not... as I walk to the side of the building towards my dorm I see all three race to get into S's car. I ask them what they're doing, they say they're smoking and there was a campus cop. It's a tobacco-free campus, so tickets and stuff for getting caught smoking are a thing. Okay. I stand there a second wondering if I should see if I can ride along and then (as if reading my mind) S says we're just going to ride, then come back and go to bed. Okay. I say goodbye/goodnight. They leave. 


I get back to my room and as I'm sitting on my bed waiting for the internet to connect, I realize that something seemed off about that. So, on a hunch, I walk back over to their dorm to see if their cars are there or not. Both R &amp; S's are gone. I understand S's, it's barely been 10 minutes. But R? She just told me she was going to bed. 


So on another hunch (and yes, this is a little weird/stalkerish), I drive over to R's gf's apartment. Both S and R's cars are there. 


And that's when I broke down. I had my phone, no one had texted/called to say hey we changed our minds, we're at J's (R's gf, 20), you can come if you want.  


I don't really know what to do now. After I got back, I posted on facebook (FB is my twitter, seriously... I document the majority of my life on it) After what I just kind of figured out/discovered, I'm done. I just want to go home. At least people actually like me there. as my status. 5 minutes later I get a text from R asking about it. I haven't responded. I don't know how I would. 


I know there could very well be a good explanation (R's been spending a lot of time at J's, so she could have left something she needed and went to get it, and S just decided to go too, or they're all having one big lesbian orgy), but from what I've gotten it doesn't seem that way. It honestly seems like they were just trying to get rid of me, which hurts so much. I don't really have any other friends, so losing the only ones... ugh.

I have a childhood friend, let's call her S, who lives in Peru who I had not seen for 7 years. I live very far so I cannot afford to go to Peru very often. I told her 4 months in advance that I was coming to see her and to take time off of work so I can spend time with her. She works in at her mother's restaurant (very small venue).

I was there for a week and she didn't have a single day off. She doesn't work normal hours either. She works from 8am to 4:00, has an hour off, then goes back to work from 5:00 to 12:00.

I offered to pay for everything but she was not able to do anything due to work. I would make plans to do something the next day, she would agree, then we went nowhere. She expected me to stay there at the restaurant for hours (while I watched spanish soaps).

Due to this, I was not able to spend too much time with her, since I wanted to explore Peru and do things. But I understood because I figured she needed the money.

So I guess this one is a bit atypical, as most are about romantic relationships, but I still want your advice and help.

So some backstory: I've been in two long-term relationships to date, while having a few short term ones as well. My first long-term was absolutely terrible. The guy was horribly abusive, angry, a bad person in general. My second is the one I'm currently in, and I couldn't be happier. The guy is extremely kind, sensitive, he listens to me and cares about me. He has a great future and we have talked about getting married eventually. This relationship has gone on for about two years. My mother thinks everything I do--except for one thing. She doesn't find him attractive and thinks he needs to lose weight.

Now I'm not going to lie, he does but *so do I*. This past summer he lived with my family and I, as he started grad school over the summer in order to get a head start. My family offered this to him free of charge, and he accepted. We (my boyfriend and I) had both planned on exercising and losing weight, and we worked out a few times but honestly not as much as we should. It's not like we're grossly overweight or anything--I need to lose maybe 30 lbs and he as well. We just both prefer calmer activities, but unfortunately my mum doesn't like that. She thought that we played too many video games, sat around and watched Netflix too much among other things. 

We *did* go out. Quite a few times too. It's just that when we *would* go out my dad would comment that we spend too much money which made us not *want* to go out. I mentioned this to my mom early in the summer but I think she forgot about it, because she said that we never went out. We did go out, it's just that we wither went out too much, or not enough. We couldn't find a happy medium to satisfy my parents. It was extremely frustrating after the fact. 

I should note that my mother only brought this up after I mentioned that I would probably be getting an internship in the city he is currently living in. I'm currently in a program which demands I be in an internship, and being that I'm trilingual there's a pretty good chance I'll be placed in the city. My mother then *demanded* I try to find an internship in the suburbs because her and my dad weren't happy with the relationship, especially because he hadn't lost weight/worked out over the summer. It's important to note that I hadn't either, and that her complaints were purely about his physical looks. When I pointed out that I hadn't really exercised either and that it didn't matter if she found him attractive, that *I* did, she said that this wasn't about me. She tried to say she was worried about my future happiness and I mentioned that I was currently happy, and that if I wasn't in the future I'm pretty sure I'd do something about it, as I did something about it with my past shitty relationships.

She seems to think that I don't have a lot of self-esteem in my looks because she kept saying, You're so beautiful you could get any guy you want etc. etc. Well I *have* the guy I want, and my self-esteem is perfectly fine because *he* built it up. She, again, didn't want to hear this. She actually threatened to break us up if I didn't break up with him. I'm 21 years old, and I'm finally in a relationship where I'm happy, and she threatens me with *that.*

At this point I was furious with her and started crying, telling her just how wrong she was, and how he helped me through so much (he really did), and I left the room. 

She tried to apologize twice for being too harsh but the fact that she has discussed this with my father and that they've pretty much been bad-mouthing his physical self (Despite loving everything else about him) has honestly hurt me so much. It makes me feel like they've been talking behind my back about my physical failings too, and blaming him as well. It's my own fault, my body, how it is, and I'm going to work to fix it; but they seem to think he's holding me back. He's not, I just really hate exercising. My mom just doesn't want to hear it.

Like I said, she's tried apologizing but if anything it feels hollow and I'm having a hard time forgiving her. I just want to get through to her that I'm happy, and that she really fucking hurt me and I'd prefer her to trust me to make good decisions. That, and not to judge anyone, especially him, on his physical looks. He's trying to lose weight, just as I am, and it's not easy. She's super skinny, and always has been (she was underweight when she was my age) so I really don't think she understands how difficult it is. I've tried explaining it in the past but she just doesn't seem to get it. 

I guess I'm asking how to confront her without seeming like an asswipe, but also how to forgive her. This happened last Friday and I haven't really talked to her since then.

I am running into a bit of an issue with our upstairs neighbors. Me [22/F] and my partner [23/F] of 2 years recently moved across the country so I could finish school. We found a great apartment that has everything we need. It's actually the downstairs of a large house. Our neighbor, we'll call her Janice, [40s/F, her three kids, and dog] have the whole upstairs. Everything is separate and we really only share the garage which has been split down the middle. 


When we looked around and did a walkthrough with our landlord, he casually mentioned that the folks upstairs have a dog and you can 'sometimes' hear it. He's the kind of guy who doesn't really care about his tenants unless they're destroying the house or not paying rent. Which is something I like, as it means I won't have my landlord up my ass about every little thing.


Now, about the dog. Don't get me wrong reddit, I am an animal lover and I always will be, but this damned dog. She is untrained and LOUD. I know most of this is not the dogs fault, she's never walked, spends the time she's not cooped up in the house, chained out front. 


When she is chained in the front, she will bark at anything that moves and run, muddy paws first, into our bedroom window. She leaves paw prints on the window. I'm waiting for the day that she goes through window. 


The other problem is that, when she is inside, she is constantly barking. My partner and I both work late and sleep in late. But the dog is up at 5:30 every morning barking and carrying on. It's disrupting our sleep. 


I've tried to talk to Janice about this and she kind of brushes it off like it's not a big deal. She'll say that the dog can't be trained and has come up with a number of other excuses. 


It has come to a head this week as Janice and her kids have gone out of town and left the dog at home (someone comes over to feed her and let her out) but that just means she is sitting at home all day and has made all the aforementioned problems much worse.  


So what should I do here reddit? I want every one to get along here and be happy with their respective living situation, but looking at this rationally is becoming increasingly more difficult as my sleep continues to suffer. Should I contact my landlord (who may very well brush the issue off), or attempt another conversation with Janice?

Long story short (TL;DR), my boyfriends (Adam) sister (Marie) is about to cause us to breakup and I don't know how to handle having a relationship with him knowing how much she and I hate each other. 

Adam and I have been together for a little over four months now. For the most part out relationship is perfect, but ever since his sister veered my life it's causing a huge strain on mine and Adams relationship. 

When I first started dating Adam, he told me that Marie was coming to visit from out of town, am to get ready to meet her. I asked him what he meant by that and he said Marie is a bitch. She is a mean, judgmental girl and won't give you the time of day. 
Now, I try to be a nice person. I try not to judge people and I always welcome someone new in to my life in the warmest way possible. Right when he described Marie like that, I told Adam that I don't want toxic people like that in my life, but I will meet her and be civil with her. 

When I met Marie, all she said was hi and shook my hand. I was okay with this, but about five minutes later she comes barging in to Adams room asking why he was screaming. He was telling her that he walked me to pluck his eyebrows and it was painful. Completely ignoring me In the room, she goes that's stupid. They look fine and go get a wax if you need them done that bad. And walks out. 
Later that night and the night after, she would call Adam to pick her up when she was drunk because she was irresponsible and didn't plan out a ride. I told him that we spend limited time together and to have it cut by his sister is kind of annoying. He took her side, which is expected. And anytime we were in his room she always felt the need to knock and barge in for literally no reason. I don't have siblings and I assumed this was a typical sibling move. But she never spoke one word to me and acted like I didn't exist. 

Marie left town, and she started telling Adam things about me that she didn't like, and the made a huge deal over the fact that I didn't add her on facebook. I accepted her request and then she called him and started dissecting my profile, everything about it. And this girl has no room to judge anyone herself. 

Up until Tuesday night, Marie had said she was staying home for thanksgiving. And then all of a sudden she decides to come down. She came in to town last night. I told Adam that I didn't want to see her or hang out with her, and he was really uneasy about that. When I got to his house, he sat me down and said we had to talk. Basically he told me that no one in his life has ever not liked his sister, and there is going to be a big problem if I don't get along with her. I said I would be civil but I didn't want a narcissistic, negative girl like that in my life. I said I would respect the fact that they are siblings and they are extremely close, but that's it. I also asked him to do one thing: if she is over, could he ask her to give us some privacy when our door is closed and not barge in and adam was EXTREMELY against this. Again, not having siblings I don't really get it, but I know that I would ask my parents to respect my privacy if he were at my house and the roles were reversed. 

After two hours of arguing this, he finally gave in. We were at his house and he texted Marie saying hey I'll talk to you in the morning if you come in. (Girlfriend) is over and she leaves on Saturday. His way of asking for some privacy. Well, she took this the wrong way, started screaming, deleted me on facebook, and went out and got drunk. 1:30 AM comes by, and she is calling their mother screaming about how she needs a ride and she can't call Adam cause I'm a whore and a bitch. So then, his mother starts screaming that I am a whore and we need to stop fucking and he needs to pick her up now. Once again, killing our night. And for the record, I was asleep sick in his bed. 

So now, Marie hates me for asking for privacy and is setting out to make my life hell, and now his mother dislikes me because naturally she agreed with her daughter. 

Like I said, he and his sister are extremely close, and I know she is going to do everything in her power to make sure he and I aren't together, and even after talking to Adam about his, he still sides with his sister. I'm supposed to go on a vacation with Both of them in a month and I am dreading that. All day today Adam has been very distant and cold towards me, and I am afraid that this is the beginning of the end. How should I confront both of them about this or mend this??

So I grew up as a Catholic. After I received my confirmation at around 15-16, I decided not to continue on with the faith. My mother and my sister are devout though which is cool, however my father started becoming an oddball. He was raised in the Mexican catholic church, and I'm assuming just to support the family values the church offered, he became supportive of attending, then stopped after my confirmation. It wasn't long after I went into college and graduate school, that he started acting strange. He would bring up topics of faith, but not God or the church. 

Then he started to get into the works of Abraham Hicks and the Laws of Attraction and started writing poems of faith and the spirits. He tries to break my mother and sister from believing in Catholicism, saying that the church was evil in forcing on the Mexican peoples a religion, which is true, yet ironic coming from his stance. Even with me, even though he KNOWS I'm not Catholic, he talks my ear off about spiritualism, and faith, and how we have to be positive because our inner spirits tells us to and whatever that damned book has to say. He bought me the book and the CD and go knows what else to jam those preachings in my head. Its annoying, and frustrating, and I'm losing my communication with him. 

I don't know HOW to talk to him on ANYTHING without him bringing up the subject on Abraham or spirits. I tried to tell him that Hey its cool that you believe in this, but let Mom and the sister be, and you know I'm not really a person of faith, so can we go back to talking about the Oscars? (I said something along those lines) He got all offended that I disregarded his faith and how couldn't I see the spirits that exist, and that I'm not being positive. And on and on. I can keep going but I hope you guys get the jist of it.

Now the parents will be visiting me for a couple weeks and they will meet the boyfriend and his family, but I'm not sure how I can communicate to my father to shut up about spiritualism and just enjoy the time he has with me and please please PLEASE don't bring it up to my boyfriend OR his family. Its definately a subject you NEVEr EVER talk about to people you just met. I've tried asking for advice from my friends but all they say is sucks to be you.

The whole situation is hurtful, upsetting, stressful... And I don't know what to do.


I tried talking to her about it. She acted like there was nothing to talk about, and then said she was too busy to talk with finals and thanksgiving coming up. It may be relevant to mention she was watching TV at the time of this attempted conversation.


I have no idea what I've done to illicit this kind of treatment, and I don't know what to do when she won't even talk to me.  Our lease ends in 8 months. I don't want to have to move out and find a subletter, but this living situation is really starting to take a toll on me.

She is in the grade below me, therefore there is not much that I can do to get closer to her in school. I'm good friends with one of her friends, but still, they are both in the grade below me. I myself am somewhat awkward around people I don't know too well, especially girls (I will randomly start to blush every now and then). She is also awkward, and both of us are very shy. I really like her and am sure that she likes me but I just never have the chance to talk to her since she's always with friends (not the one that I mentioned) and also isn't too outgoing herself. I would really like to make the best out of this dance and hopefully become really good friends with this girl or even more. It's just in the moment, I feel like if we continue to not talk to often (we only text every ~2 days and even when we do, it seems like a forced conversation and its not much) then the dance is going to be really awkward for both of us, and not fun, which means that afterwards we'll probably just lose contact with each other WHICH I DON'T WANT TO HAPPEN.

Last Sunday, in the middle of our church session, Mom takes out a church pamphlet she got from the entrance and begins making little doodles here and there on the poems. Not really caring about what the pastor is saying, I watch her do this for the rest of the session but still listen to what the guy is saying.

Dad watches her too, between brief glances and given his seriousness to God and what not, I know he takes this as disrespect but doesn't say anything until we get home.

Dad walks into the bedroom where Mom is, getting ready to change her clothes, and begins conversation with her. I'm not in the room when this happens, but close enough to hear that both are pissed. It quickly turns into a yelling argument. 

Mom leaves the room in the middle of the fight and goes to the kitchen, where Dad follows her. She doesn't respond to him anymore even though he insists on asking questions while she makes her lunch. She sits down, and answers,
You're not my father and I'm not 12 years old

Then Dad heads to the living room where I'm at, gets my 20yr old brother and tells us both that we only pay attention to the pastor and not my mom and whatever she's doing. All the while she eats silently in the other room.

When my Dad's not around, my Mom tells me that she can listen and do something else at the same time and it's honestly not that big of deal and that Dad was watching her too. And how he only pushes us to go to church because he wants to, not us.

22015,Non-Romantic,3gqrf6,"My brother and I are not very close to begin with. When we were younger, we'd play together all the time, but these past few years in high school, we have drifted off and we never do brother/sister things like we used to. We both have our own things now.


When I was younger, about 7 years old, I stole 20 dollars from his desk. At the time, I thought it would be funny to see his reaction missing his money. (I know, it's messed up). Instead, he went to my parents about it and I fessed up, resulting in me being disciplined severely for it. I never had the intention of actually keeping the money, but I know that what I did at the time, was extremely wrong. I have never done anything like that again. Anytime I want to even touch someone's possession, I ask for permission. 


So today, I needed to print something urgently, but my brother was at an appointment and I needed to use his computer. I, without his permission, logged into his account since I know his password, from him telling me a few years ago. Later, when he came back home I was planning on telling him that I used his computer to print out something, but he came home and saw his account logged on. He immediately freaked out, smacked me in the head hard and punched me in the arm a few times really hard too. It hurts still since every time he punches he deliberately tries to hit with his knuckle to cause more pain. I feel like I deserve it though since I did betray his trust by accessing his account. So I apologized, said I would never do it again, (and I intend to keep the promise). I admit, I have logged onto his account a few times ago in the past and I know I am 100% in the wrong for it. He knows that I have done it in the past.


So after he saw me using his account today, he punched and smacked me. Then proceeded to calling me a stupid b****, saying that this was the reason why I have no friends (not true, I have plenty of close friends) and calls me a lying thief and brings up the incident of me stealing his money when I was 7, which was 11 years ago. It's quite annoying since he hits me over the littlest things, which I think is uncalled for, and always brings up what happened 11 years ago. 

I'm pretty used him beating me on a daily basis and verbally abusing me. I don't really care since I'm used to it. I have tried to hit him back, but he is much stronger than me and will hit me back with 10 times the force, so I just take it. My parents don't do anything about it.

I love my brother dearly and I always try to help him out. But it feels like he never does the same for me. I know that I am not the best sister, but he isn't the best brother either. No matter what good I do for him, always the small bad things I do outweigh the good, and he brings up things from the past (11 years ago) all the time. 

I know that my parents have raised my brother and I really well. I know that I've become a pretty good person, but in my opinion, my brother isn't. At home, he wastes food all the time, expects everyone to do what he wants (one time I was in the washroom getting ready for work, he wakes up and urgently needs the washroom. I tell him I'll be out in two minutes and I rush to get everything done. He says he can't wait and doesn't want to go to the other washroom and goes to get the washroom key, opens and kicks me out of the washroom with force and locks me out when my things are still inside, then he calls me selfish for not getting out of the washroom when he needs it).

He is my younger brother, but my parents make excuses for him all the time, saying he's young and doesn't know better (even though he's already 17), and my parents enable him all the time. I really want to build my relationship with my brother, since I'll be knowing him for the rest of my life. He has a terrible view of me based on my past mistakes and no matter what I do to try and change it, he still thinks badly of me and thinks I'm less than him. How do I change this? I want my brother in my life, as my brother and future uncle to my children, since he's the only other immediate family I have other than my parents. I am willing to look past his negative aspects and fix what I am doing. Most importantly, he does not trust me at all, since I have accessed his account without his permission and stole from him 11 years ago. If you guys have ever been in a position like this, I would love it if you gave me some insight. Thank you.

My husband and I both like thrifting.  We like hand me downs.  We like used.  For us, cheap and unique is where it's at.

MIL also thrifts but also enjoys the finer things.  In her mind, if something is stained or imperfect, it is broken.  Fair enough.

My MIL inherited gaudy golden cutlery from her mother when she passed.  When my husband bought his house, she gave it to him, having never used it because she thought it was ugly.  He loved it.  I met him, and food became an important part of our relationship, and his gaudy golden cutlery became a simple, sweet thing that we enjoyed together.

Fast forward a few years and the cutlery is now worse for wear.  MIL thinks it is horrible and that we should replace it. My husband and I are indifferent - a fork is a fork, right? - but I thought maybe it would make a nice surprise Christmas gift to get him a new gaudy golden set (and make MIL happy when she eats here, which is infrequently).

I told MIL this and asked her to keep an eye at thrift stores for a gaudy gold set for me. (The only sets I could find cost hundreds of dollars - an amount I am not prepared to spend on something we don't need.)

I never found one. Neither did she.  No big deal.

At least, I thought it was no big deal.  Our anniversary was in November and she presented us with a gift! How generous!  It was a beautiful, understated silver cutlery set. Something I would definitely pick out for myself if I was going to buy myself a new, silver cutlery set.

My husband and I thanked her, and after she left, we agreed that the gift seemed a little underhanded and that we were still happy with our gold set and we would keep the new set until we were ready for a change.

MIL came to visit in January, noticed we were still using the gold set, and immediately asked me about it.  I directed her to my husband, who was also in the room, and he told what we had discussed.  She seemed unhappy with the explanation.

We saw her again just last week, and she took my husband aside and spoke to him about a number of issues (mostly about me). But the one that surprised me the most was this cutlery.

She thinks we're selfish and ungrateful.  She's hurt.  

I think she's being a little controlling.  I might be an asshole.

Is there a way to fix this? Do we just use the silver set from now on and make her happy? Do we go on with what we want and let her be hurt?

I knew that moving in with her, her girlfriend would be around frequently. We all get along fine so I thought it would be okay, but it's starting to get a little too extreme. 

My roommate works night shift, so she sleeps during the day. Even when she's asleep, her girlfriend is here.

This has happened way more than once… I've often come home to find her studying in our kitchen or folding laundry in the living room or watching Netflix on the couch. It's not that I don't trust her and we get along just fine… but something about it just rubs me the wrong way that she's not paying rent but basically lives here for free. Why does she need to be alone in our apartment when both of us are out?

22023,Non-Romantic,2eed4v,"I no longer live with my mother and have not for a few years. Before I changed my address on my license, I worked at several strip clubs, including one that is now being sued by a former dancer. When doing hiring paperwork, your tax information has to match the license on your state ID in most clubs in my city, so knowing that clubs send tax info with under a more neutral sounding name that does not suggest it is a club, I had no problem with it. However, a few months ago, I received a letter that had on the front of the envelope for the whole world to see: READ IMMEDIATELY FOR INFORMATION PERTAINING TO [STRIP CLUB NAME] EMPLOYEES! This letter was sent to the address the club had on file--my mother's. This club doesn't have a particularly obvious name; it actually sounds more like a sports bar or something. My mother put it in my stack of mail for when I visit--usually just store offers/magazines--and didn't comment much on it when I collected it. I called the lawyer's office at that time and asked to not be contacted any further. I would not put it past her to later google the club name to try to figure out what the letter was about.

A few days ago, my mother texted me a photo of an envelope with a
lawyer's name and office as the return address. I couldn't remember if it was the same main office as before, but I thanked her for letting me know I had mail and said I'd pick it up when I visited this weekend. There was no club name or message on the envelope. Today, I arrived there with my sister, and my mother handed me the envelope. It was open. She said that she was concerned I had an unpaid bill, so she decided to open it without asking or informing me. (FWIW, I believe this is a lie.) She gave me a really angry look and said that I was being asked to join a lawsuit, so she definitely read the whole thing. The letter names me as a dancer, notes that I worked at the club in question some time between the years of blah and blah, says another dancer who worked with me is suing, and lists my options to join her suit. I skimmed it, made no comment, put it next to my bag with other random mail, then started skimming a magazine I had received. My mother did not say anything directly to me, but I believe this is only because my sister was there, and my sister would go berserk if she heard.

I believe my mother already had suspicions that I was a dancer, but she never directly asked. I chose to keep that part of my life private from most people, and her in particular because she was very controlling, invasive, and used emotional blackmail often to get her way. She has gotten nicer since she was diagnosed with cancer almost two years ago, and since I moved out without notifying her before that. Despite her softening up a bit, I still do not always trust her. If you have ever seen The Sopranos, growing up, my mother was much like Livia, Tony's mother. I believe she has borderline personality disorder, but she has refused to see a therapist because she says she talked to one after my father's death and that s/he didn't do anything. I have already come to terms with the likelihood that this letter will be thrown in my face one day when she is mad at me over some perceived slight against her, and I am okay with that. I do not regret stripping and am not ashamed of it, nor do I think I ought to be made to feel bad about keeping details of my life private--my boyfriend knew, and he's the one whose opinion on stripping mattered to me. But I guess my question is: how would you handle this? Should I just pretend she never passively confronted me? Should I tell her not to read my mail in the future? She always goes on about how she respects people's privacy, but I've seen proof before this that if she thinks she has the moral right to invade, she will. She once tried to pull my robe off when she found out I had a tattoo she didn't know about when I was 21 or so. She screamed that she made my body and so she had a right to know what I had done to it, in addition to a lot of other particularly nasty shit. *Shrug.* My boyfriend doesn't have a very crazy family, so he doesn't know how to advise me, and I guess I'd just like some opinions on what my next move, if any, is.

I am moving out around the 15th of August, and today my grandmother had a 'discussion' with me about what furniture I will be taking with me. By discussion, I mean she told me I had to leave my $150 computer screen, my $300 flatscreen tv, my $500-600 art desk, and my $200 speakers for my laptop (this may seem cheap to you, but it is expensive to me and my family!).

Let me give you some info on my grandmother. She IS forgetful, but she does not have dementia or alzheimers. She is however, very *very* manipulative, and uses her illness as a crutch. In fact, in the last three years I've lived with her she has made up four different illnesses so she can get sympathy money to pay the bills, and then run off to Corpus Christi or Port Aransas to get drunk (and then never talk to those people again by ignoring them). 

She has the sweet old lady thing down, and my mother is in complete denial even when it is obvious. She has borrowed (lying about an illness or symptoms) thousands from my mom, and has even stolen hundreds of dollars from me and little sister (17). Here's a great example: My grandmother has some fake teeth, and in the last three years I've lived here she has asked my mom to loan her a couple *thousand* dollars so she can get them replaced in Mexico. Her reasoning is that the Mexican dentist keep giving her real teeth which then decay really quickly from drinking soda, so she needs to get them replaced with more fresh teeth. When in reality she picks up my aunt or her friends, and they go and spend a month in a resort in Mexico while blowing through the cash. She has bragged about this in front of my mom, and she still doesn't believe this! It is such bullshit.

So back to my problem, I am only worried about the speakers. My mother sided with me on everything else because she bought them for me herself. My grandmother denied everything, and lied saying they were gifts from other family members and friends. Uh no, my mom still had the reciept for some things and proved her wrong. My grnadmother, oh well you know my memory, haha, I'm just a silly old grandma!. That is her favorite thing to say, I'm just a silly old grandma! when her bullshit and lies catch up to her. Not to mention the death glares, and threats she gave me after my mom left, Don't come to me when you need a couch to sleep on when you flunk out of school! (Lady, I have a 3.2 gpa).

Now to the speakers! Long story short, two years ago my ex was spending time with me when my neighbor (rich as heck) asked him to set up her new computer software. She's super sweet, and said she would give him the speakers as a reward ($200 speakers with a fantastic bass). He loves computers, so he accepted, and he got the speakers. My grandmother was ENVIOUS of those damn speakers. After hearing them she came into my room and announced You know since she's MY neighbor I think she meant to give those to me. Of course this lead to a fight. I will leave the details out, but it was freaking ridiculous. After we broke up and he left to the Air Force, he gave them to me because he said he could just buy better or new ones. Well, she never dropped the subject. Since then the story has changed on how she ever owned the speakers, and she has been trying to get them from me since then..

So today, after everything with my mom, she brought my neighbor in. Let's call her Elle. She tried to get Elle to tell me how she gave those speakers to my grandmother. This is how it went:

Gran: Do you recognize these?

Elle: No?

Gran: Do you remember giving them to [EX] when he fixed your computer?

Elle: That was so long ago I forgot he even did that.. no, I don't remember.. it was a long time ago. Oh wait, yes, I remember he did not want cash just something else?

Gran: No, you gave him cash.

Elle: No, I remember he absolutely didn't want it.

Gran: No, you gave him cash.

Elle: Did I? I don't think so.. I gave him a gift I think??

Gran: No, no sweetie you gave him cash.

Now rinse and repeat this for a few minutes. This is my grandmother's favorite tactic. Just repeat the lie until they start to doubt themselves. It's very easy with old people especially my neighbor who has awful memory.

Me: No you did not give him cash. I remember that day, you offered him the speakers, he came home with them a few hours later, and [grandmother] started a fight.

Elle: You two are fighting over these? I don't remember these, I don't remember anything from that day.

Gran: She is lying Elle, she's a twentyone year old girl, that's what she does. Now I KNOW what happened, you gave him cash..

Aaaand the rest is pretty much the same, but Elle believed my grandmother because she just repeated it until she said Maybe I gave him cash. And now my grandmother is flaunting that I'm wrong, and rubbing it in my face. She manipulated her, and she knows it.

I don't know what to do. I know Reddit hates walls of text, but I need people to understand that just because she is old doesn't mean she's sweet or 'just forgetful'. She has been like this since her twenties (from what I've been told by practically everyone who grew up with her), and has always gotten her way. I love these speakers. I hate just giving them to her so I can move on without hearing about it from my mom (who my grandmother uses to take sides against me). At the same time, I would feel guilty if I took them. I don't know why. They belong to me, but I still feel like I am taking them from her. Or maybe that's part of her manipulation. Like I said, she has changed how she obtained these speakers multiple times so I know she is full of shit. Just.. what should I do? Should I take them and let her be mad at me? (She holds grudges forever by the way.. she has a grudge against my sister because she was carrying cinder blocks, and my grandmother kept giving her too many. She was in flip flops, and one fell and BROKE TWO OF MY SISTER'S TOES.. she hates my sister because she couldn't finish her stupid patio over a few broken bones, and that was a few years ago).

So yea.. take the speakers and stand my ground? Give in, and let her gloat for the rest of her years?? If I took them they would be going to my boyfriend's house in a different city, so she would never see them again. However, to my mom, stepdad, and whoever the hell my grandmother tells, I will always be the thief that stole from her sweet, sick grandma.

TLDR I live with my grandmother, but I'm moving out, and she is claiming my electronics as hers. Most importantly, a expensive set of speakers that were given to me, and she is manipulating my family making me look like a thief even though she has stolen thousands of dollars from my family.

For the past 4 to 5 years (since graduating college) I've come to realize my mother's behavior towards me (and others) is manipulative and destructive. The fog slowly started to lift and reveal how nasty of a person she is once I was no longer living under her roof and didn't have to rely on my parents for financial stability. In retrospect it was a very toxic environment.

Before I get into it, let me give some stats about me and my parents:

I’m a 25 year old male who holds a BA, got a job offer before even graduating college, started 2 companies since graduating and work for myself making more money than both of my parents. I’ve never had a problem with drugs, didn’t even start drinking until college, have never been arrested, etc.

They married out of high school. They never dated anyone else. They never moved farther than 2 towns over from where they grew up. They never went to college (my dad as of 2 years ago did get his bachelor’s degree). Needless to say, they aren’t very open-minded. My mom is VERY quick to judge, making sweeping statements about entire groups of people just because someone on Good Morning America said so. They have never explored their own beliefs, they’ve simply been followers. They believe in God but don’t go to church. They’ve never questioned it, or embraced it. It just is.

---

That being said, I will mention that my parents gave me a very privileged upbringing in the traditional sense. Aside from the occasional spousal argument that I had to witness, they provided me with everything I could ever need and definitely spoiled me when it came to birthdays and holidays. I was constantly reminded how I was loved, was never physically harmed, etc. Everything fit the bill on paper… except for the manipulative, controlling behavior of my mother.

To keep this post as short as possible, I’ve condensed some of the things she said and did when I was growing up that in retrospect were detrimental to my mental stability:

1. When we’d go clothes shopping anything I felt confident about, when I tried it on my mother scrutinized it and told me how “unflattering” it looked. She curated my image based on what she wanted to buy for me. Needless to say, to this day I have a hard time feeling good about anything I’m wearing. I lost any confidence I should have from my mom taking that from me while growing up.

2. Being told that I’m too skinny, which is funny since I can’t control my genetic make-up that (surprise) you fucking gave me! This included my mom refusing to acknowledge that I wear a size SMALL (“You wear a medium! Smalls are for girls!”) until about 4 years ago.
My parents questioned my sexuality when I didn’t have a girlfriend in middle school/early high school. “You’re not gay ARE YOU???!” With a tone that implies negative consequences if I was to say yes.

3. Forced to play sports even after bringing up wanting to quit and being bullied, because “that’s not what you do.” They very much wanted to fit into the rest of society, meaning I had to play along as well, even if it meant sacrificing my own interests and emotional well-being.

4. Buying me expensive gifts so that she could use it against me later if I wasn’t being respectful in her eyes. It was common to be told that I’m “ungrateful” for all of the things they’d get me when I’d act out.

5. Despite being an almost straight-A student, if I ever received a lower grade on an individual project or test, I was guilt-tripped and made to feel worthless for not doing better.

6. When I was 19 and in college I wanted to get a tattoo. After deliberating on it for months to be sure I wanted it, I sent an email to my parents outlining my reasoning and reassured them that I thought this through (after all, they’d eventually see it, and the thought of them thinking I’m hiding it from them terrified me). Result? My mom cried her eyes out and pulled me out of school for a long weekend for an intervention of sorts. That’s right. They drove up to my college and pulled me out of school for wanting a tattoo.

7. Told my hair looks bad on countless occasions

8. Told that I’m “too sensitive” and need to “stop acting like a girl” simply for expressing that it upsets me when they say mean things to me.

I could go on for days with this shit but I’ll spare you the boring crazy stories (unless you want to hear more). The bottom line is that my mom is incredibly high-strung, aggressive, judgmental and tone-deaf. Things as simple as putting pie on the wrong shelf in the fridge is a cause for her to turn it up to 11 and flip shit. It is commonplace for her to yell, and I mean YELL, and when she’s called out for raising her voice, she will (still yelling) say “THIS IS JUST HOW I TALK!” I can’t even keep count the amount of times I heard that phrase shrieking into my ear canal while growing up. Usually directed at my dad, since I was too scared to even talk.

I should also note that in addition to having a short temper, she has extremely high anxiety regarding just about everything, especially things related to your health. She religiously watches “Dr. Oz,” I still to this day receive weekly emails of articles (strictly from ABC news) about the latest vegetable or fish that is going to give you cancer. I remember when the concern for cellphones causing cancer was big in the news and my mom would obsessively yell at us to keep our phones away from our genitals. I was also not allowed to stand too close to the microwave when making food because cancer. Laptop resting on my lap? gonna cause cancer.

If you left the house for any reason and then come back inside, you can’t sit on your bed because you’re dirty. If she didn’t SEE you wash your hands before a meal, you were forced to go wash them again before you were allowed to eat. My mom uses hand sanitizer so much that she just refers to it as “gel” now. She has bottles of it everywhere. She buys them for me unsolicited to this day.. “keep this in your car okay?”

If things didn’t go according to plan, expect a full freak-out. My dad once left his wallet at home when we were going 5 minutes down the road. My mom proceeded to chew him out, calling him an “idiot” and “stupid” for forgetting his wallet. All the while I had mine and was willing to pay, instead she continued to yell, forced him to drive back while me and my SO were forced to awkwardly walk around with my enraged mother. She make sweeping judgements about whole groups of people, talks ill about family members, including telling us after leaving a family gathering that one of my cousins was “fat.” He was 8. She freaks out when she sees people of color. One time we were going to see Cirque du Soleil show at a college campus and she saw a black kid walking (presumably to class) with books in hand and she immediately said “we must be in a bad area.” The ignorance is strong with this one.

As of late, I’d say about once or twice a year we have a huge argument that always ends the same: My mom says hurtful things to me, I explain why they’re hurtful, she turns it around and makes it about her, and how I’m being disrespectful, and then goes into hysterical crying and says shit like “where did we go wrong.” and telling me that “I just care about you okay? I don’t MEAN to say anything hurtful.” and then immediately after saying “you need to stop being so sensitive!”

The kicker? We part ways after I try to explain that just because your my mother that doesn’t excuse you from saying shitty things. I’ve tried to explain it in the simplest terms like “if you wouldn’t say it to your boss, don’t say it to me.” but they just don’t get it. My dad has understood maybe 10% of what I said, and he’s actually made an effort to curb that behavior, but my mom is just as delusional and abrasive as ever.

The last time I saw them was over the holidays before new years. We had a huge argument after my mom asked about the tattoo I’m getting (I’ve learned to not bring these things up, but she asked) and after the first question she immediately used this tone that was just so aggressive that it felt like an attack. Every question I felt like I was defending this thing that I care about, rather than just talking about it. Asking things like “well I hope they aren’t getting their ink from china or something! Did you ask?” “You aren’t getting like spider webs on your arms or something are you?!?” She loves to start every question with “you aren’t doing ____, are you?!?” Which that sentence structure would put anyone on the defensive. You’re setting it up for me to be defensive! You’re asking a question but you only want one answer, otherwise you will be disappointed. Which was the icing on the cake. She said “I’m disappointed in you. I don’t know who you are trying to copy, but I wish you wouldn’t.” Because, you know, I can’t make decisions for myself. And I’m such a terrible person that I’m a fucking disappointment for wanting to do something for myself.

That conversation evolved into a discussion again about boundaries and not saying nasty things to someone. I explained that when she does that it makes me not want to share things with her, it makes me not want to call EVER. It’s the same god damn conversation we’ve had a dozen times now. Over. and over. and over. And she continues to turn it into an attack on her, that I’m being disrespectful. And that they should be allowed to voice their opinions (you know, an opinion that I never asked for in the first place). And that “not everything is happy and sunshine. We’re going to give you the hard truth.” I mentioned that none of my friends treat me this way, and that even if they don’t particularly care for something I’m interested in they keep it to themselves. Response? “We’re not your friends, we’re your parents, and we care about you so we’re going to tell you the truth, even if it hurts.” They continued, and said that I’m being “so disrespectful.” and that “we’d never talk to our parents this way.” My dad chimed in and said “If I did, I would’ve gotten smacked upside the head.”

I’m so sick of this notion that because you birthed me, I have to put up with whatever bullshit you throw at me, and you get to call it “out of love.” Fuck that. If you are being an asshole, and I call you out on it, how am I disrespectful and your behavior is off-limits for discussion?

The worst part about all of this, I’m only bringing it up because I want to have a healthy relationship with my mom. I want to be close to her. I want to be able to tell her things. I want to feel safe. I want to feel like I have someone who I can come to when things are bad. I want to have a better relationship, but she refuses to listen. She would rather continue to push me away by refusing to look at herself and her behavior. For fuck’s sake I’m looking into a therapist for myself because of this, and that’s the last thing I could ever see my mom doing, because in her eyes she’s done nothing wrong. She actually said that the last time I saw her. I told her that what she said was mean and hurtful. And my dad goes “Well I can see that it might have sounded mean, so if it offended you we’re sorry, but we don’t MEAN to be hurtful. We just CARE.” My mom immediately goes “wait. I never said anything mean. I’m not sorry, speak for yourself!”

She is so far off the fucking deep-end I don’t think there’s any hope for change. I fucking hate it. I hate the relationship I have with her. I hate that she continues to have a grip on me. I hate that she can give me undue stress and anxiety from 3 states away. I hate that I’m a grown man who’s accomplished so much, yet I continue to feel a weight on my shoulder from this toxic person. I fucking hate it. I really do.

Last week my boyfriend sent Trish messages on facebook asking how she's enjoying the foreign country. He also asked her for help editing a short paper, since she's good at it (and he's not). She happily helped him, and everything was fine. 

Except, that it wasn't. Two days later, Trish has deleted her facebook account and created a new one. She won't add any males as friends. 

My boyfriend asked another mutual friend what was up, and the answer came back that Trish's boyfriend saw the facebook messages and became angry--so she deleted the account and made a new one with only girls as friends. 

My boyfriend sent Frank a message explaining that they're only friends--and have been for a long time. He basically said chill out. Learn to trust her, but since you don't, you obviously have her fb messages and can read through them to see that I'm telling the truth. 
Frank replied saying that he was Trish's boyfriend, and that she shouldn't talk to any guy except him. 

How can I explain this to her? The only way I can contact her is through the new facebook account--which I'm sure Frank monitors. I know Trish lives with Frank and his family in the foreign country--and I don't know that she has enough to move out. Beyond that, she seems happy with him.

22062,Non-Romantic,354wch,"My fake name is Leah, My brother's Luke, and our biological father's Anakin.

Anakin and my mother met when they were young. My mother being younger than Anakin by 2yrs. I'm not entirely sure when they met but I think my mom had to be around 15 because she had me when she was 17. By this point she is married to Anakin and has been living with him for some time. My mother's family does not approve of Anakin. 

From what I heard from my mom growing up was that she had a crazy past: a lot of partying and hanging out with dangerous people. Anakin, was well known to police: a known drug dealer/trafficker and trouble maker. He had drug problem, mainly meth and cocaine. He was violent; there had been instances in which he was violent with my mom or friends who happened to be around.  He loved me and my brother. He didn't pay child support; they were divorced in 1987- he was ordered to pay $75 a month in child support (that was to cover both my brother and I) and he was granted supervised visitation. This was due to the fact that he had an extensive criminal history. Anakin was around 21 when he last saw my brother and I.

When I was five, Anakin called my mother and asked that she send my brother and I to him in the state that he lived with his family. My mom refused and we didn't hear from Anakin again.   

Quick note-growing up with my mother was not easy. She was angry and was at most times abusive, both emotionally and physically. She was a rager. More so with me than my brother. My brother was always getting into trouble, sometimes for stupid things, others times not. His punishments were much more mild than mine. Where he was put in timeout or grounded, I was spanked etc. 

I am not under the impression that if Anakin were present, that life would have been better; in fact, I am of the opposite opinion. I believe that our lives would have been harder if my mother stayed married to Anakin.

My brother holds a lot of anger over his childhood. Luke has PTSD, drinks heavily, and smokes a lot of pot. I know that when I visited him a couple of years ago that he and a room mate (one who no longer lives with him) used to huff cans. He is in school and I believe he may be having financial problems. 

Last year through social media, Anakin's family reached out to me. Anakin doesn't have any social media accounts, but his brothers, sister, mother and son does. They provided Anakin's contact information to me. 

I wasn't sure what to do, but I thought what it must be like to be in Anakin's 'shoes' and so I decided to hear what he had to say. 

Anakin had gotten into some trouble with the law in the state we were living in and if he were to get arrested, he would've ended up going to prison for years. So he left to the state where his family lived. There he continued to get into trouble, hit rock bottom and ended up in prison. When he got out, he got his life together. Some time through those years he remarried, and had two sons. I believe he was married and had at least one son before he went to jail. He's been clean since the mid 90's.  Anakin says that he has made a few attempts to find my brother and I throughout the years. 

I can't hold a grudge for the choices someone makes in their life. I have made my own mistakes in my life and I know that I would not like to experience that. Also, anger is a poison. 


Anakin asked me to pass his contact info to Luke. When I did, Luke didn't refuse it, but has not reached out to Anakin. I feel that Luke would get some sort of closure or healing from some kind of interaction with Anakin. In the past, Luke had shown interest in contacting Anakin, and had made attempts in finding contact info for Anakin. But since the events that resulted in his PTSD and budding anger...he's just been angry. I walk an egg shells around him or when I am talking to him. It sucks.

Luke does not agree and he wants me to tell Anakin that he wants nothing to do with him and to F*** off. I refused because I believe that if Luke is going to make that decision then he needs to be the one to tell Anakin; that it is not my responsibility to share that. 

I find the whole situation uncomfortable because Anakin often mentions that he hasn't heard from Luke and he wishes that Luke would reach out to him. I tell Anakin that Luke will reach out when he is ready. 

My mom thinks that I should tell Anakin what Luke has said. 

I am going to meet Anakin for the first time since I was four. This will happen within the next few weeks.

22112,Non-Romantic,362ner,"I [30F] live across the country from my family, and I am in my hometown for a week and staying with my parents. Last night, my sister [26F] invited me to her house to hang out with her and her boyfriend. While I was there, she waved a gun in my face. I left out of fear for my own safety, and now she is mad that I am upset. 

A little background on my family: we are middle-class white people living in a Western state (though, I moved to an Eastern state to attend graduate school 8 years ago). My parents are financially comfortable and on their way to retirement, but my sister is living well below the poverty line. She dropped out of college (she believes she is “too smart” for it) and has worked a series of dead-end/minimum wage jobs since she was 16. My father pays most of her rent and many of her bills. In spite of this, my sister not only has premium digital cable but also an expensive drug habit (cocaine, opiate pain killers, weed, and shrooms) and just recently purchased a $900 semi-automatic handgun to add to her collection of semi-automatic handguns. She just completed a concealed carry course and received her license last month. My sister has a habit of dating abusive scumbags, and I think having guns makes her feel safe. I also think she likes guns because she and my dad can bond over them. My dad has always kept many guns, and growing up my dad took us shooting and taught us the importance of gun safety – such as, never assume a gun is unloaded; always treat guns as if they are loaded; never point them at people – you know, common sense stuff. I also own a gun, so it’s not like I’m against gun ownership.

So, last night I head over to my sister’s house where she is hanging out with her boyfriend on the couch, getting high, and watching some shit movie on her giant flat screen TV. The new gun is on the arm of the couch, pointing toward the recliner I want to sit in. NBD, I just rotate the gun 90 degrees so it’s pointing toward the wall behind us, instead of at me. My sister gets pissed that I’m acting so paranoid. I’m like, whatever, I just don’t want a fucking gun pointing at me.

My sister then gets into some kind of heated argument with her ex-boyfriend over the phone for half an hour – in front of her current boyfriend because she is classy like that – so I move to the floor and start playing with her dog. She finally hangs up the phone and picks up her gun and starts doing something to it – what, I have no idea. She was holding it upside down and pulling the top part (the slide?) back repeatedly. I was sitting on the floor about 5 feet away from my sister, and at one point the gun was pointing right at my face. I knew it was an accident, so I asked her if she please could not point the gun at me. I wasn’t mad. I just assumed that she wasn’t paying too much attention because she was on her usual cocktail of opiates and pot. My sister then got really angry. “What do you think I’m doing?” she asked me. (I have no idea what she was doing, honestly.) I think she was trying to imply that the gun was not loaded because, right then, she deliberately waved the gun at my face a few times! I instinctively reached for my glasses and my phone and stood up to leave. She saw I was leaving and got upset and tried to convince me that I’m overly paranoid and uptight. I didn’t argue with her, I just told her I had a headache and needed to leave. 

It didn’t hit me until I had gotten in my truck and driven a few miles. Then I started sobbing so hard I could barely drive. I had never had a gun pointed at my face, and I suddenly felt so terrified thinking of what could have happened. She claims that the gun was not loaded, but I was taught to never point a gun at someone – loaded or unloaded – because accidents can happen. Especially when you are high out of your fucking gourd. Growing up, my dad told us the cautionary tale of his friend, a fellow firefighter, who was cleaning his rifle while he was babysitting his grandson. The friend thought the gun was unloaded, but there was a bullet in the chamber, and he accidentally shot a hole through the floor, just inches from where his grandson was sitting! Driving home, I felt terrified but also incredibly disrespected. I just can’t believe my sister cares so little about my safety, even if the chances of the gun actually going off were miniscule.

When I got back to my parents’ house, my dad knew something was wrong because my sister had called to warn him that I was mad about something (she didn’t tell him what). He asked me what was wrong and I told him I didn’t want to talk about it. I feel really angry at him, for some reason. I think because he knows my sister is a piece of shit and continues to bankroll her idiot lifestyle anyway. He also snorts coke and smokes weed with her sometimes. They are both idiots. My mother, btw, is a high-functioning alcoholic and does not involve herself in family matters to any great extent. 

What should I do now? My sister has not apologized. Do I ask her for an apology, cut her out of my life, or leave town early? Should I tell my dad what she did? Am I overreacting to this whole situation?

I've been in university for the last 1.5 years and am graduating next spring. All of my major classes are now upper division, and have thus far been a serious pain in the ass, with giant group projects due right before finals. I decided to take up a Computer Science minor this quarter because it goes hand in hand with my major, and I figured I'd never learn to code on my own. My first CS class has been fun, fairly easy in regards to homework, and my professor is young, funny...overall great. 

I was complaining to a couple friends (after our CS class had just ended) about how sleep deprived I've been because of my OTHER classes, but I'm an idiot and simply said Ugh, my professors have been such jackasses this quarter. We all complained a little more after that, and then walked out of the classroom to see our professor standing right outside the door. 

I don't know if he heard me/us, but we had been sitting right by the exit, and he was standing literally 6 feet away so I'm fairly positive he heard. I really like this professor, he's been super helpful and accommodating- he even scheduled office hours for me when I needed help outside his normal hours.

I don't want him to think I called *him* a jackass, but I'm then worried that if I do say anything about it, it'll seem like I'm trying to suck up. What should I do, just leave it alone or clarify my statement?!

I've never *not* known/seen him so he hasn't been totally absent but it's more of a 'go stay with your Dad for a weekend' throughout my childhood. I actually [wrote a post last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/246rd9/me_23_f_and_the_negative_relationship_with_my/) detailing at length our relationship if anyone wishes to read that too. I guess it's kinda important to say that the previous post was asking whether I should continue to keep in contact with my absent 'father' or not. Most people said I should cut him out. After I made that post, he did actually change a little bit and things were going good but he slipped back into his old ways. 

Now, I have a new issue.

My Dad emailed 17 of his nearest and dearest via joint email to tell us all he was divorcing his third wife. He's divorcing her because she is uninterested in him and has given him the 'silent treatment' for 2 months. Want to know why? Her son had brain surgery for a tumour and my Dad went on effing HOLIDAY while she needed him there. I'm not close to his wife at all but even I can see that she is totally right to be angry at him.

Secondly, what kind of weirdo emails a bunch of people telling everyone this? Who broadcasts the ins-and-outs of their divorce like it's an effing weekly newsletter? I'm so weirded out by it. 

But this brings me on to another problem. I am genuinely concerned for my father. He is clearly mentally ill. He has discussed suicide before and I'm afraid that being divorced for the 3rd time will have a serious impact on him. I'm worried that this might be the last straw to push him over the edge to actually do it.

I don't know what to do. I don't want him to do it and then I feel like I didn't do enough to stop it by being there for him emotionally. But how can I be there with someone I a) fundamentally think is in the wrong and b) have next to no emotional relationship with? If I try to help him, I have to show him that he has made some mistakes but I know he'll push me away if I disagree with anything.

It's not even about him being my Dad anymore. I just don't feel like I can sit by and watch a human being destroy themselves.

When I moved into my apartment roughly 2 years ago, the landlord gave me a key for the front deadbolt. The apartment works like this, we have a main door and then two doors inside that door. (By law there has to be a lock on the outside door). My door on the inside is made of that thin wood stuff. This isn't a front door kind of door. I guess it's also worth mentioning that I was pregnant when I moved in. Anyway, my natural assumption upon receiving a key for the front door was that I was allowed to lock it. I did this and was met with not one, but 3 notes telling me not to lock the door. I spoke to the landlord who said he would make sure she had a key. It should have ended there. This happened a few more times complete with yelling/banging on my door as well as duct taping the actual lock open. Additionally, every guest I have seems to be interrogated by this woman(about me). I rarely speak with her, so this rubs me the wrong way. 

Fast forward to a few weeks ago. I place a small trash bag on our shared porch and forgot about it for a few days. I know it was my responsibility to take it out back, but I really just forgot with taking care of my son and school. One day on my way in, I see the bag on top of a package delivered to me. I take the bag off and put it down and say to myself, shit, I have to take this out tonight. I'll do it after the baby is in bed. I go inside, and not 5 minutes pass before there is banging on my door. Not knocking, banging. I open the door and she shoves the bag into me and walks away yelling something about having a 16 year old to clean up after. Had she simply asked me to take it out, this would have all been fine. 

Today's incident started at 7:30am. I had locked the door last night (after 11, probably closer to 12). There was banging on my door followed by yelling (note: screaming) at me from outside of my door about my indiscretions. Lots of obscenities and I'm sure the whole neighborhood heard. I replied that having a key was her responsibility. I also reminded her that the porch was full of her (fucking) trash(I haven't been able to have anything on the porch because there is just a ton of her random crap). I seriously don't even feel safe in my home anymore. I'm not allowed to lock the front door because I'll be met with this kind of behavior. I alerted the landlord, but I'm not sure this will solve anything. 
Is there anything more I can do in this situation?

---   
**tl;dr**: neighbor refuses to let me lock our shared door out of safety and is abusive when I do. The landlord has been notified, but I don't really know how much he is going to do. Is there anything I can do?



**Edit:** thank you everyone for your responses. I feel like a pushover for letting this go on for so long without a clear resolution. I expressed my concerns with the landlord and he said he would try to reason with her. My lease is up in January, so I'm going to start looking for other places. If this doesn't get resolved immediately I will take further action and follow some of your suggestions. Seriously, thank you so much. This has been an incredibly stressful situation. 

**Update:** I came home and the front door was locked. No nasty notes either. Will keep you guys posted. 

**Update 2:** I was resting because I didn't feel well today, so when the neighbor knocked on the door, my friend answered. She told him that she would really like to stop this whole door locking thing because her son doesn't want to bring a million keys with him when he goes out to play basketball. -_- she then went on about how they never bring their keys blah blah blah and she shovels the walkways AND if I would like to continue locking the door I should contribute to shoveling. She added that she didn't think I'd want to be shoveling with a baby on my back... Wut.

We had movie marathons, we'd go hiking together, we'd meet up for coffee, etc.

22166,Non-Romantic,3hdwrx,"This weekend, my younger sister (we'll call her Zoe), who is still at university, flew across the country to visit me in New England. We had an amazing time seeing tourist attractions, whale watching, and just hanging out.

On our last night, however, we had a dinner conversation that really scared me. I don't remember exactly how it went, but the gist is below. As a little more background, Zoe has an old acquaintance (we'll call him Andy), who used to give her rides home from university to the suburbs and, I suspect, had a crush on her. My parents considered him a nice and polite young man. Zoe also has a current boyfriend (we'll call him Caleb), who seems to be a genuinely good-hearted guy and excellent match for her. 

Anyway, the conversation:

Me: So, how's your old friend Andy? I haven't heard about him in a while.

Zoe: I cut off contact with him.

Me: What? Why?

Zoe: He started to take me for granted and take advantage of me. I felt like I was always just his crying shoulder for when he wanted to talk about his ex or borrow my notes...and then I heard that I was his 'backup'; that's why he wanted to hang out with me all the time. I'm nobody's second choice. 

Me: Good for you. But you seem a little upset. Did he do anything else really bad that made you want to cut off contact?

Zoe: Well, yeah.

Me: Oh.. Did he..cross any boundaries?

Zoe [I do remember this line perfectly]: He came pretty damn close. I don't want to talk about it.

Me: Okay, I know you don't like to tell me things, since I don't keep secrets very well, but have you told anyone?

Zoe: I told Caleb. He hates Andy's guts.

Me: What about Mom or Dad?

Zoe: No. I don't want to make a big deal of it, because it would mess everything up. I'm doing him a *favor* by keeping quiet. And I am fine. What's with your face?

Me: I don't know what to think. Look, if he did anything that would make me or our brother want to strangle him, we can't take that lightly. It pains me to think that something could be constantly on your mind and making your life...less happy.

Zoe: It's not. I think of it like my dyslexia: I don't bring it up to people, because I don't want to be treated differently. I just deal(t) with it. I promise you - everything is okay and I am over it. And I talked to Caleb about it.

Me: Well, okay. But I wish I could help you more. If there's anything - anything - that still bothers you, please promise me you'll tell someone else.

Zoe: I will.

Me: *Really*?

Zoe: Yes.

The subject then changed, and things seemed normal. Zoe is one of the strongest, most blunt, and least sensitive/emotional people I know; if she ever looks upset, something is *very* wrong. Frankly, she's a badass rock. And she didn't seem that upset during the conversation.

But I'm still not sure if she's 100% okay. Should I say anything else to her...or to anyone else?

My gut almost says no. I know her, and she appears to be doing great now. Whatever comes of my inquiries could indeed start an exasperating firestorm of hard feelings from all kinds of people - perhaps to no real end, if she wasn't actually that traumatized.

22176,Non-Romantic,1ncre9,"**Backstory:** (for easier reading: Ex-friend will be named Ashe)

We met in fifth grade and had been best friends until a year after we graduated (2011). In tenth grade, she got into a relationship with a guy (J) that lasted until around the time we stopped talking to each other. The two had a tumultuous relationship that escalated after they got engaged. I tried to play mediator between the two (stupid move, but at the time, I was asked to) and ended up getting too involved in their relationship. Ashe ended the relationship and it destroyed J. He called me one day and asked to talk because he was depressed, so we hung out with one of his friends. I also found out that he started cutting and was becoming increasingly suicidal in the aftermath of the breakup. One night, he blurts out that he had romantic/sexual feelings towards me, which put me in a tight spot because: a) I knew he was rebounding, b) Ashe was still my best friend and it was wrong to do anything with him, and c) I was terrified that turning him down would make him harm himself more. I let him know my feelings towards what he said and he was okay with it (however, I pulled his best friend aside and asked to keep an eye on him to make sure he wouldn't go off the deep end). Well, a few weeks later, we got high together and ended up having sex. I instantly regretted it. Ashe finds out by going through his Facebook and seeing the messages between us and blows up at the both of us. I was eventually able to get her alone and talk to her about what happened, acknowledging that I fucked up and apologizing for betraying her trust. She said that it was okay and I thought things would soon get better. She later deletes/blocks me on Facebook, tells our mutual friends, one of whom harasses me about it, and generally hates my guts. We'd see each other from time to time (small town/went to the same community college/still have mutual friends) and she'd basically treat me like I don't exist. 

**Present:** 

I ran into her last week at Dunkin Donuts on my way to work and asked her for her number, fully expecting her to either ignore me or tell me to fuck off. Weirdly enough, she gave it to me. I texted her later on in the day to see if we could talk and she gave let me know when her days off were. Later on in the week, I asked again if we could talk over coffee, but she wouldn't answer my calls or texts, so I let it be. Yesterday, she called/texted me, but when I answered, she didn't respond. So, I'm currently at an impasse on what to do.

22183,Non-Romantic,2xhi0d,"So my mom and I have a pretty good relationship. She tells me a lot about her past and struggles she's had in previous relationships, and I'm very open with her and give honest feedback. We occasionally hang out together on the weekends. This is all fine and dandy, and I really like these aspects of our relationship. 

However, my mother can be hellish to deal with. She's, at least from my perspective, INSANELY needy. 

As a 17 y/o, I'm bogged down with school work and other activities on a daily basis, and yet, everyday she pressures me to hang out with her. Just today she asked me to hang out in her room and watch tv. I told her that I couldn't, that I was going to clean my room and do my homework, and she immediately starts complaining. She's always trying to guilt trip me saying that I never want to hang out with old mom, yet just yesterday I hung out in her room for hours. It dissolved into an entire argument. Similar happens at least twice a month. 

She's constantly asking me if I'm going to stay home or go off to college, and I'm constantly telling her that I don't know, because I don't, but she insistently tells me that of course I'm going off while at the same time begging me to stay. A few days ago she told me that she was moving to wherever I was going to college! What is she going to do when I move away from my college town? Is she planning on lurking in my background for her entire life? I can't express how burdened I feel when she says stuff like that. 

She's constantly asking me what I've had to eat. Everyday. It isn't like I'm deathly thin, I'm 120 at 5'4. I told her that I'm 17, I know how much I have to eat, and she goes to the extreme. She tells me that if I think I'm all grown up and independent, I should do everything on my own. She completely stopped helping me with anything in the house. She stopped cooking dinner and insisted that I keep the house spotless on my own. I didn't insist that I was an adult, I just said that my nutrition isn't something that she needed to worry about. Was I wrong?

She just returned home from a week long vacation. Before she left she told me that she felt great anxiety leaving me and my sister (21, 22 in five days) alone for so long. When she returned she gave me a bracelet with a little hook that if pointed towards your heart indicates that you're taken. She put it on me and suggested that she was my true love until I turned 18. She periodically looks at it to make sure I haven't turned it away. 

Those are the only things I can think of right now though I'm sure there are others. So tell me, is she clingy, and if so, is there anything I can do about it? Is it just me being too sensitive? I just feel very overwhelmed by her. I feel like if I say anything, she'll get extremely defensive.

A little backstory.


I recently returned from overseas, and am going through a divorce. My husband and I married young and too fast (after only half a year of knowing each other), we are still friends but he is in the military and we needed to both go our separate ways. I had no where to go to, so I ended up moving in with my mother in Florida. Before I moved here everything seemed to be in order- actually the move was more of 'Oh hey, we are putting you on a plane in 12 hours, hope you have your shit packed.' My mother said she had a place for me to stay, that she was staying with a guy friend (she said they were just friends), and I even talked with him in text messages and he said I would have a nice comfortable place to stay for a bit.


I KNEW going in to this, that I would be living off of a couch for a bit and I had no problem with it. I just needed a way out because how I was living was not ideal. Neither the husband or myself were happy, I was overweight and depressed and it was really weighing on me- there were days (for months) when I just laid in bed most of the time.


Fast forward to getting off the plane, my mother had plastered a genuine smile on her face and was so lovey and caring, 'Oh, I havn't seen my baby in about four years!' She told her roommate, who I met at the airport as well. He was a nice man, my mother's age [43] a bit on the.. goofy side, but I just knew I wanted to get home and sleep, I was exhausted after 23 hours of travel.


We showed up at the apartment, come to find out it was a one room apartment- and it was a mess. Since I have showed up I have deep cleaned the kitchen/den/hallway area (which is all one). I have not touched the roommate's room, because it's his room and I don't feel comfortable going in there- and it is where my mother and him spend most of their time. They left their clothes laying in the middle of the floor for about a week, they had garbage piled up- and everything else you could imagine, there was no food in the house. Don't even get me started on the bathroom, which I have still not been able to fully clean: and on top of all of this, they are both HEAVY smokers, about two packs a day. So the house smells terrible, and every time I leave and come back I want to be sick. Noting, I have asthma and my mother knows this- but she doesn't seem to care. She will come over and blow smoke right in my face.


I have been out every day, except on Sundays, to turn in job applications. I have turned in 20 something since I ended up here and have not really heard much about them. I keep going out daily and poking and prodding because I really need the money. I don't have a car, my husband sold the extra car. I don't have a bed or any of that nonsense (I came here with 2 bags), I figure I can get that when I get my own place. I am perfectly OK just sleeping on a floor until I can make my own way.


My husband tries to send me money when he can, $20 here or there, the other day he was able to send me $100 and both my mother and the roommate begged me to buy food for the house. I told my husband what I spent the money on (he can't really do much being overseas) but it was all food you had to cook, and was healthy-- lots of veggies and things as well. My mother used almost ALL of the food in the first three days, she makes SO much extra food and it goes to waste and when I ask her not to- she screams and yells at me. There is no food left in the house, at all, and I have no money at the moment to feed myself- all I ate from what I bought was a bowl of cereal, a little bit of chicken, and pineapple. 


My mother DOES NOT have a job, and she ISN'T looking- and the roommate only works like 3 days a week. Mom spends all her time on skype on some Second Life game with her now 'husband', who is married IRL. She's always talking and flirting with him loudly until 5-6am, she won't even get out of the chair to put up the clothes I folded for her, so they are still sitting on the kitchen counter and have been there for over a week now.


Neither of them help take out garbage, they leave dishes piled up in the sink- I even woke up the other morning to a gallon of milk spilled on the kitchen floor and one of them just half hazardly threw a towel over it and left it there for goodness knows how long. I work my butt off around the house, and then spend a lot of my day out walking around and trying to find a job, while they lay in bed and then she is up all night. Also noting that she posted her laptop up in the den, right next to the couch- and when I ask nicely if I can sleep, she ignores me completely and says something about me being ungrateful and that I owe her because she gave birth to me.


She lies to everyone, multiple people have caught her in her lies and then she lies about lying. She lies to my face and then turns around and tells my roommate that I do things, when I really don't. I havn't spoken an entire sentence to her in about two days now. She had to go to court this morning, and she came back in to the apartment and started yelling at me about how I needed to pay attention to her, when I was walking out the door when she was walking in. She screams and yells about everything, puts me down about everything; and makes the excuse that she can't 'do anything' and 'hates her life and everyone in it' because her ex-boyfriend (who she dated for two months, a year ago) died. He was the 'love of her life', supposedly. Now, I am not saying that CAN'T happen, but she doesn't do anything to help herself and she brings everyone down with her.


The roommate actually kicked us both out the other day because of what my mother did, and she blamed me for it. The roommate use to sneak around and shit talk my mother and then not tell her to get off her butt or anything, now he ignores me too because my mother will pitch a fit if he talks to me. So he walks around the house and mumbles under his breath and my mother openly cybers and doesn't watch her noise level.


I am not sure what to do. I am in a new state, have never lived here EVER. I don't know anyone here. I am stuck here with my mother and a man in a one room apartment, with no job and no car- and can't even get a full night's sleep because my mother's 'internet husband' is more important that health or trying to find a job and do better for herself. She says she wants to get an apartment with me, but she is making no effort to do so and I don't really have any interest in moving in with someone as dirty or lazy as she is.


I have no idea what my options are here, I feel like I am stuck at a dead end. I am normally a very calm and collected person, tidy, and respectful- and here I am stressed to the max.

It was so amazing to finally have a friend to speak to, and it was nice to get it off my chest once and for all.  Well, after I told her, our friendship immediately deteriorated, and we haven't really spoken about it at all.  Up until last night.

We have a group text with a couple other friends, but it isn't used too much.  Whenever it was used, I said my obligatory hello, and kept it on the down low.  Well last night the group started chatting again, wanting to hang out because it is currently winter break.  Well my good friend texted me individually, which led to me stating I was upset with the fact that our friendship crumbled, and more over upset with her, because she really did nothing in my time of woe.  

I go on to learn that she didn't have a great year either, and that was one of the reasons we drifted apart.  I am torn.  I feel so selfish that I expected her to really be the rock I needed, but also disgusted in myself I never really thought that she could be going through rough times as well.  A couple walls of texts later, we come to conclusion that we both messed up, and are both to blame for our falling out.  It just doesn't feel right.  Whatever friendship we had left is now even more unstable, and I think she is really mad and/or upset with me now.  All while I feel lost on what to do.  I really, really care about this friend.  I just don't know how to get things back to normal, if it can even get back to normal.

22192,Non-Romantic,2l5g8p,"Some backstory: I've been friends with Craig since 2006 when we both met in college. We're part of a big group of friends, most of whom still keep in touch and hang out till this day. But I always considered Craig my closest friend and he's said the same thing to me on occasion. Craig can be abrasive and self-centered at times, so some of the group don't like him.

Anyway, in 2004, my dad (in his 40s) got a stroke and he was partially paralyzed since then. He's also always been a bit sickly, and there was also a pancreatic cancer scare at one point, so I was always shuttling back and forth between school and home to see my family. My friends knew about this and were always supportive, and I thought Craig was too.

In 2010, one of our mutual friends in the group was getting married, and at that point the group had been starting to drift apart so there were plans to gather everyone together again and go for a trip together before heading to the wedding. It cost quite a lot and it was really difficult to line up everyone's schedule, but most of the group were able to make it for that trip. So off we went and I was looking forward to spending time with everyone again, and Craig said the same thing to me as well.

Unfortunately, during that weekend trip, I received some shocking news. My dad had a second stroke and didn't make it. It was such a shock that I remember just sitting in my room and not moving for a very long time, at least until Craig came in at some point (we were sharing the room).

He had just come back from a trip to one of the outlet malls with a few of the guys, and when he saw me he started telling me about all the cool stuff he bought and how cheap the bargains were. I was too stricken and just kept quiet, and when he realized I wasn't responding to him, he asked me what's wrong. I told him about my dad, and he just said, Oh. He continued to put away his clothes, and at that point I just started sobbing over my dad.

I mean, I was crying my eyes out with grief, and I was too upset to pay attention to Craig or what he was doing. But when I opened my eyes to grab something to wipe my tears (and snot) away, I saw that he was trying on his new clothes and admiring himself in the mirror. I'm not proud of what I did next - I yelled at him: What's wrong with you, asshole? I just told you my dad died! And he got defensive and said, What the hell, this can't be a surprise to you, your dad's always been sick. 

I saw red at that point and was so angry/upset and started an argument with him, and I don't remember what I was shouting. One of our friends staying next door, Joel, heard the ruckus and came in to separate us, and according to Joel I was acting like a madman and screaming all kinds of things at Craig, and Craig was screaming them back at me. Thank god Joel separated us before it got physical, and from then I'm not too sure what happened. All I know is that Joel made arrangements and got me a flight home.

That weekend was a mess, and I kept it together long enough for my family so we could get through the wake and the funeral. Most of my friends cut the trip short so they could come and pay their respects. Craig didn't come at all. 

He didn't make any attempt to reach out and apologize to me, so I considered our friendship over and blocked him on Facebook, deleted his number, etc. I heard from Joel that Craig was complaining about me 'spoiling' that trip after so much effort had gone into getting everyone together. Fuck, typing this out is just making me so mad all over again. I couldn't believe what Craig was saying, and many of our friends were angry with him for his reaction as well. I think it was their decision to boot him out since some of them had never really liked him in the first place.

Anyway, recently I received a text message from a number I didn't recognize, and it was Craig. He kept asking if he could call me, and I refused to reply. Then he started calling, and I rejected all his calls. Finally, he texted and said, My dad died of a heart attack yesterday. I'm so, so sorry bro, now I know how you felt. I was a douche and an asshole. I sat there stunned and filled with sadness for a while, and I texted back to say I'm sorry for your loss which is more than he ever gave me. After a while my phone's battery died, but when I managed to charge it again, I realized he had texted again to ask if he could call, but I hadn't replied (because my phone was dead) and after an hour of no reply from me, he texted, nvm.

Now I'm really not sure what to do. I told the group about his dad's heart attack, and they were shocked and somber, but it seems there's no plan to go to the wake or anything like that. Later I find out from Joel that the group don't really intend to arrange anything, and he said it's probably only going to happen if I do something because Craig was the closest to me. 

I know I should be the bigger guy here and put aside our past differences, but I still have a lot of anger from how callously Craig treated my dad's death and how he was a shitty friend, and may have been a shitty friend all along. Part of me wonders why I should go to the effort for him when he was more interested in his outlet store buys instead of my grief (to this day, I get physically sick when I see the American Eagle brand, because that was what he was wearing when I told him about my dad). I guess I should just put my anger behind me and go to his dad's wake, even though he never came to mine. What should I do, Reddit?

22205,Non-Romantic,2bjhbv,"I am a younger woman working in a *heavily* male dominated workplace.  I work as an operations engineer. I am the only woman on my team of about 20. I'm starting to get burnt out.

I have never had a bad work performance review and I get along with my coworkers. I actually really like my job. However; I'm starting to feel some resentment. Often, I am interrupted, my opinions seem to be dismissed very quickly, and projects that I am working on are discussed without me being present or providing any input. I am not asked to interview candidates, invited to meetings, etc. Even when every single member of my team in invited to a meeting, I am not. Even our more junior employees seem to be held in higher regard than I am. Essentially, I feel pretty worthless. I've never had any problems with work like this in the past, and I don't know what to do.

I've spoken with only a few close friends outside of work about this, and they all immediately jump to the conclusion that some members of my team are sexist. I am reluctant to throw out the accusation of sexism for a few reasons. I do not want to jeopardize my job or make enemies, and honestly, I don't *know* if I'm being dismissed because I'm a woman! It could be anything! It could be because I'm younger, or because I also happen to be a minority, or because I grew up poor! Shit, this is an at-will state, they could fire me for not liking my eyebrows if they wanted to, as long as they didn't tell me that was the reason. It could even be that I'm stupid and actually suck at my job, and no one has told me. I don't think I am, but everything they are telling me through their actions says otherwise!

I have mentioned my frustration to HR, I gave specific examples of events that have taken place, and proof that they did in fact take place. HR told me that I was being too sensitive and to get over it. (It's not like I was a crying hysterical person. I was making a complaint, but I tried to be composed, thorough, and logical.) 

I do not believe I am sensitive. I have a high threshold for bullshit. Life is difficult and unfair, and I don't really believe in coddling or being coddled. My parents were very tough-love, so I'm not an emotional person. At all. If I am doing anything wrong, it is that I am too proud, and I am perceiving disrespect where there is none. It is hard for me to wrap my head around this, though. Their actions scream disrespect and exclusion to me, I'm having a hard time seeing it any other way. Am I crazy? How do *you* see it? If the normal person reads this and thinks Yup, too sensitive. Then I'll know I need to buck up and quit whining. If there's something else at play, I need to know I'm not crazy, acknowledge it, and find a way to work around it.

My dad has never been good with reading emotions and he often sounds a lot more angry than he really is. He's tough, so to speak. He also is seemingly unaware of when he's crossed the line when he's teasing someone. I'm his only son.

His fiance has an 11 year old daughter. She's only been raised by her mom and female nannies (mom is a doctor, very busy)

When you combine that you get a hardass dad who seems a lot worse than he is combined with an extremely sensitive daughter who has never been around any male figures in her life.

Additionally, my dad has the opinion the daughter is doing things that she is much too old for that are appropriate (sleeps with an extremely dirty stuffedanimal/blanket that cried when washed it, sucks her thumb, requires someone to read to her every night) so it seems a struggle for him to either play along with something he finds wrong, or risk making the daughter dislike him even more.

I know my dad well, and I can tell that he's making a big effort to be more sensitive and to go back into father mode, but his reputation has already been tainted and I think he's getting impatient. I also have a good relationship with the daughter, and have kind of considered explaining to her how my dad acts, while also explaining to my dad the way she thinks. I think I can attempt to mediate this situation, but I'm really nervous.

That's why I still live with them, for the most part. I moved back after college, then everyone moved in together, and I'm afraid to move back out because I'm the daughter's go-to person when her mom isn't around. I also HATE when I have to tell my dad to be more nice to her right in front of her, because I think she uses that as justification that thinking he is mean is backed up even by me. He doesn't mean to be mean, he just takes things a little too far and has a shorter leash than me when it comes to the daughter knowing when I'm joking and believing my dad's jokes as his opinion of the truth.

There's a ton more I can talk about, but for lengths sake I'll leave it there. Just wondering if anyone has any experience with this type of situation.

Edit: Households were combined 7 months ago. Dad's been dating fiance for 3-4 years prior, fairly slow relationship that sped up in the year prior to engagement.

22237,Non-Romantic,2w5pyt,"I've always been busty. I wore a C cup by the time I ended sixth grade, and now I wear a DD. If I move my arms forward enough, I can make my cleavage go all the way up to my neck. I've been painfully aware of my cleavage my entire life. Though I've never recieved comments on it from anyone else but my mom, I've been especially careful to cover up. I wear high-neckline t-shirts and whenever I wear something low-cut, I wear a scarf or a high tank top so that way you can't really see much. On occasion, I'll stop caring and I'll wear a normal shirt (which looks low cut on me), but I only do that on days in which I know I'm not going to be out in public much, or if I am, I am not going to be in an area in which many kids will be around. (i.e. bars, friend's house, etc.)

When I am around my house, however, I wear tank tops. Most of my clothes make me feel suffocated during the day, so when I'm home, I wanna just feel free. I mostly stay in my bedroom when I'm home, so I don't ever feel obligated to cover up.

I have four younger brothers as well, two of them who live with us. The other two live with my dad a couple states away from us. My youngest brother [11] refuses to wear pants when he's at either of our parents' houses. I've rarely seen him wearing actual clothes other than underwear because of it. Nobody gets mad at him, and he's had neighbor kids over to hang out while he's in just his underwear. Not to mention he jumps around a lot (He has a problem with jumping around while playing video games, which is pretty much the only thing he does with his life.) I am constantly asking my mom why she doesn't force him to wear clothes for days at a time, yet when I casually walk from my room to the kitchen to get a drink, suddenly I'm a harlot. 

My mom's habits of telling me to put a shirt on get worse, which is the only reason why I bother writing this. Obviously if it were just an issue of her asking me, I would be fine to just cover up whenever I'm outside my door. That's common courtesy. The hypocrisy of my brother? Sure, internalized sexism, he's the youngest so he gets babied a lot more, I'm the only female, yadda yadda yadda, that's totally fine. If this was the only problem, I'd happily put a shirt on whenever I'm outside my room.

Except it's not. Aside from my brother's nudity, my mom has a habit of walking around naked, or leaving her door open when she's naked. For instance, recently my boyfriend came over to the house, and she came walking out in panties and a thin tank top. My almost-nude brother was also in the room. Nobody says anything because nobody cares at this point. But before she leaves the room, my mom makes a point to tell me I'm showing cleavage. Great. Even earlier today she had the door to her room WIDE OPEN right after she got out of a shower. And because she left something in the other room, she even walked across the entire house completely NAKED to get it. Then, as she walks back, she has the gall to say Hey, my boyfriend is coming over. Put on a shirt.

My mom has even shoved her hands in my cleavage/bra to show me how much boob I'm showing. She's done it in front of my friends too, which is absolutely humiliating. I'd never just wear a tank top in front of my friends, so I have been fully clothed every time she has done it. One time she did it while I was wearing a dress, preparing to go to a mutual friend's wedding. The dress was normal cut, which meant I showed some cleavage, but was still modest enough that my super-conservative bride-friend wasn't concerned about what I was wearing. But still, she does her thing and shoves her hand in my boobs, and says Wow! look at all that cleavage!

This is getting borderline disgusting. I've had some conversations with her in the past, where I've told her that I think she's invasive, and it always ends in her laughing, telling me that it's ridiculous that I'm arguing against modesty (I'm not, but she'll twist any argument.) and that I'm ridiculous for asking her to stop pointing out my boobs. 

I'm starting to feel overwhelmed, to the point where I am becoming self conscious at all times, even when I know I'm well-covered. How do I approach this so she doesn't do this again?

22246,Non-Romantic,2n3jam,"I was taken in at 5 and adopted at 14 along with my younger brother. My previous posts tell more of this story, but the gist of it is that my biological mother, Jane, has some major issues that likely include mental illness or a personality disorder, killed two of her children through neglect, and ended up losing the rest of us over the years.


The oldest surviving child, Louise, was removed from the home and adopted out after two of her siblings died. I knew she existed but only met her briefly when I was 16. We had her over at Jane’s brother’s house for a family lunch so that we could meet her. She was pregnant with her first child at the time and was living at home. I have never seen her since and had no further contact through the rest of my childhood. We had separate birth fathers.


Over the years, Jane tried to get us back, including attempting to kidnap us at one point. She finally signed the adoption papers when I was in my teens. My adoptive family is the only family I was raised with and with whom I bonded. I do not view any of my siblings as a lesser relation than my younger brother, to whom I am a full biological sibling. I have seen Jane twice as an adult, both because of funerals that required me to return to the town where I was born. I have her on Facebook but have started restricting her access to my page, posts, and personal information due to numerous boundary violations.


Around 13 years ago, Jane called me. She has sporadically been in touch over the years but it is uncommon to hear from her unless she wants something from me. She explained to me that she and my half-sister had become close as adults, were currently roommates, and wanted to know if they moved to my state would I be willing to let them move in with me. I said no. I was told later on by family in that area that Louise had left her baby with her adoptive parents and was living with Jane since they didn’t approve of her lifestyle and wouldn’t let her live at home if she didn’t straighten up. They eventually stopped living together and Louise had a second child.


I did not hear from Jane again for the next five years until she suddenly started harassing my younger brother for my phone number. I gave it to her so she would leave him alone. She called once or twice but then also immediately gave it to my half-sister without asking me. The day Louise got my phone number, she called multiple times but I was doing yard work outside and missed all of the calls. I returned to a chain of missed calls and a creepy voicemail in which Louise ranted about how much she loved me and how I was her sister and we should do sisterly things. I was concerned by this as I had assumed the threat was over with Jane’s health declining, but now Louise was showing signs of having the same or similar disorders as she while young and healthy and mobile. I ignored her call but contacted Jane about violating the boundaries I had in place.  Again, I didn’t hear from her or Louise for about five years.


About a year or two ago the contact from Jane picked up again. My brother and I theorize that she is getting older, has made no plans for her future, and is trying to find someone to take care of her in her old age. In March Louise attempted to add me and messaged me on Facebook.

I haven’t blocked her on Facebook yet because I don’t know her well enough to rule out a potential threat and I want to be aware of it if she decides to come out to my state and try to find me.

I am wondering whether or not I should reply to her and reiterate that I don’t want a relationship with her, block her entirely, or just keep her unblocked and continue ignoring her. I have already warned my younger brother who said she tried to add him but hasn’t messaged him.


He has Jane already blocked because of boundary issues with her and their three kids. Jane seems to not lose her mind over it, although she is upset, but starts reaching out and crying around to my siblings whenever I restrict contact with her. Recently, she’s been messaging people about my life and wanting details on it. I just lost my partner to cancer, my adoptive mom shared the post that I previously had blocked from Jane, she saw it, and has started calling and texting again. I’m concerned that this is just going to get worse, I'm tired of dealing with it, and I want them both out of my life without bringing harm to anyone else.

Recently, she has been shirking cleaning out the dishwasher, she rarely takes out the trash, and she expects me to buy all her groceries for her (with reimbursement).

Background: Me and bf (will now be called R) have been together for just over 2 years (since I was 16 and he was 17). I come from quite a large working class family, who are very close, and I live with a single parent. R on the other hand, comes from a very estranged, well-off family. I'm currently half way through my degree, and R is finishing college, about to go into university. We are each other's first real relationship. 

Okay, now to the problem - his family. 

I could always tell his mum didn't like me. She was never too thrilled that he had a girlfriend. The first time I went to his house, I fell down the stairs (master of first impressions guys), and she asked when I left if I was drunk. She also did a complete check of everything in his room, checked his bin (for condoms, we'd been together 3 weeks wat), and went crazy when she realised I had been under the covers on his bed...it was the middle of winter and R keeps his windows open.

From then on she just kept saying snarky comments behind my back. Things like, telling R not too get too attached because it's not going to work out, or saying that we wouldn't be together long term type of things. I just sort of brushed these things off, thinking it was just her adjusting to her boy having his first real relationship (she has proper attachment issues). But it wasn't. She's actually grounded him before him before for coming home half an hour late from mine, even though he didn't turn up home the next day when he was at one of his friends house.

She says all the usual stuff like he's such a mummy's boy no girl is good enough' but the first Christmas we were together, she got blind drunk and told him that I wasn't good enough for him, he could do better, should dump me etc. Honestly, I think she was panicking that it was coming up to our first anniversary, and that her 'mummy's boy' hadn't dumped me yet, even with all her meddling.

His family isn't much better. I've met 4 of his aunts and uncles. And only 1/4 is a decent person (and he's not even blood related). One of his aunts told him to take condoms with him when he went on a lads holiday incase got lucky one night. She said this after meeting me, and while I was there. His other aunt straight up ignores me when I'm in his house (which is actually easier to deal with). His uncle stared at my hand, like I was some sort of peasant, when I tried to shake his hand when I met him. He just sore of stared me down till I walked away.  And finally, his uncle F. He is the NICEST man I have ever met. He is fully supportive of the relationship, says how nice of a girl I am, how proud he was when I got into uni. Honestly, I could write a book about how much I love his uncle. 

This is the same for R and my family. They have taken a shine to him, and they all welcomed him with open arms. One of my uncles has taken him under his wing and shown him a lot, since he is in the career R wants to have. 

The problems started when R started staying over at my house. His mum would give him total consent, and would then give him the cold shoulder when he went home the next day. She would ignore him for days, and say very little for weeks at a time. 

One day during the summer, my aunt asked if we would babysit her 3 dogs for a couple days (we would only be left alone for one night). We jumped at the chance, as R loves dogs, and it would give us some time away (and they just got a hot tub). We had a great couple of days, and my uncle even offered to bring him back over to let him play with his tools, and build a patio area for the hot tub. R was so excited, and couldn't wait to go back. 

This is when it became a real problem. 

Everything was fine, dropped R home, went home myself, and told my mum how good it was to have some peace. Later that night, R tells me he and his mum have had a massive argument. His mum asked him how his weekend went, and he said it was really good and that he couldn't wait to go back and that my uncle was gonna show him how to use the tools/build stuff. His mum went mental, saying stuff like how my family was so moral less, how dare they leave us alone in a house without adult supervision, and how dare they LET US SLEEP IN THE SAME BED. She also said how me and my family were scum, and that I was just a stupid little girl who just wanted to play house, and pretend like we were a real couple. R argued saying that my family have been nothing but nice to him, and that if she had all these concerns why did she give him consent to go I'm the first place. He also asked for a genuine reason as to why she doesn't like me and my family, and she couldn't give him one. The next morning, his dad pulled out the lawnmower and said condescendingly aww R, would you like to show you how to use some tools?.

As a result of all her behaviour, I haven't been to his house in 7 months. 

Every time I think about it, it just brings me into instant rage. She's a very manipulative woman, and I don't have the time or energy to continue pretending that she isn't. 

A couple months after it happened, she asked R why I haven't been down in so long. He told her that I didn't feel comfortable being in their house when (she) insulted me and my family like that. She went crazy again, blaming R and telling him that it was all his fault and he never should've taken what she said out of the house (even though it's about his own girlfriend).

A few weeks later, she casually mentioned to R that she was going to this concert with a new girl from work and that she'd be perfect for him (we'd been together 20 or so months at this point). 

I've told R all along that if she apologises, I'll forget it. 

So it's 7 months now. She hasn't made any effort to apologise. Instead, she's bought me things. Flowers, chocolates etc. I find it really aggravating that instead of giving me an adult apology, she's trying to buy my forgiveness with gifts. And it's not like she doesn't have opportunities. She's dropped R off at my house plenty of times, she could come talk to me. But no. She constantly asks R whether I hate her or not, and he just doesn't answer her anymore. 

R recently told me that he has a family wedding in a few months, and I'm his plus one. But really I don't think I could stand a whole day with his family and mother, pretending we all like each other. Plus it's family he never sees, and even he doesn't want to go. 

I find it genuinely frustrating to have put genuine effort into making his family like me, and all I've had in return is insults. I really don't have the energy in me anymore to put up with her. 

So, if you made it this far, what should I do? Forgive her and go to the wedding? Continue to not go to his house? 

Any advice is helpful. 

TL:DR - Bf's mum is a psycho and called me and my family scum after my family let him stay at their house for the weekend. Not spoken to her, or been at his house for 7 months. Should I forgive and forget?

PLEASE help me. This is going to be long, and I apologize. But I just love my mom so, so much and I'm worried and have no one to talk to about this stuff.

My mom has always been chubby, ever since I can remember. Her weight used to yo-yo a lot. When I was a kid I think she did Weight Watchers for a time, and there was a period in the late 90s or early 2000s where she did Atkins. Basically, she never fixed the *problem* and just fixed the symptoms, you know? She would stick with something that had big results fast, but then never worked it into her lifestyle in able to maintain the results.

My mom has already had knee surgery once. A while ago she was doing physical therapy, was seeing a nutritionist, the works. She started a new job and all of that ended. Her knees are always hurting her. Her doctor has told her that if something doesn't change that she will need a knee replacement. Her knees hurt because A) there's just too much damn weight on them and B) she doesn't *use* them enough. She knows this. Just today I snuck a peek into her hamper to see what size her pants were. Size 26. She is 5 feet tall. I have no idea what her weight is, but that has to be around 300lbs, right?

I was out running errands with my dad the other day and in the car he laid it all out for me. He's been trying to get my mom motivated, get her out more, etc etc. But it's like she's just so STUBBORN. Part of the problem: my mom is an exceptionally smart woman. She will study and document every little thing. She knows more about nutrition and exercise than an Olympic athlete. Only she just won't fucking *do* anything about it. My dad pleaded with me to please talk to her about her weight. He's scared. He's hoping that maybe if she hears it from not just him that it will sink in.

[This is where I start crying] I asked my dad if she had gained more weight. I see her all the time, but you know how you don't notice change when it's happening slowly over a long period of time? He said bigpropbigmom, she's as big as a house. That hit me like a bat to the face. My parents are stupid in love. They hold hands everywhere they go, all that shit. But all I could think about, and this is going to sound so SO stupid and childish, was oh my god. Does dad not think mom's pretty anymore? It broke my fucking heart. Such a stupid thing to think about. Looming heart attack, is mom still pretty? But it's what I thought and it just makes me want to fucking sob.

Something you should probably know about my dad: A little over a year ago my dad was diagnosed with diabetes. This was a HUGE shock to all of us. My dad [60M] is very fit. 6' and probably hovering right around 200lbs. He hikes, rides an exercise bike every day, does light weight training a couple times a week. The diabetes came out of left field. His dad was diabetic, but he was also a rip-roarin' alcoholic, so the family always assumed those two went hand-in-hand. Guess not, must be genetic. My dad immediately changed his diet even more for the better, takes medicine and checks his blood sugar religiously (he is not insulin dependent or anything like that). When he was first diagnosed it hit him very hard. He told my mom that he needed her support. He would have to be very careful about what he ate and asked my mom to keep bad groceries out of the house, etc. She did at first. Not so much anymore. My dad sticks to his diet, and my mom still keeps all the extra bread and shit around, only now she's the only one eating it.

My dad told me that he is scared my mom is slowly but surely killing herself. He's terrified, and it's like she just doesn't care. But like she makes a big show like she cares, but then she just does nothing about it. Apparently her cholesterol is bad, and he says her blood pressure must be bad. She was walking up the stairs the other day and my dad thought she was going to pass out. He has the same talks with her over and over. Nothing.


I am currently trying to lose weight. My husband and I want to have a kid in the next year or two, and it got me thinking Fuck this. I don't want to be a 'big' parent. I want to be a good role model and not be wheezing after my kid all day. I'm 5'1 and 178lbs. Ick. So I got myself a little fitbit, it keeps me on track all day. I get my steps in each day, I track my meals, I drink my water. It's cool. I've already lost a dress size. I'm really excited and dedicated to being healthy. Rad.

We live in one of the most beautiful places in the US. Each spring/summer millions of tourists come here to hike/kayak/walk the trails/rock climb/whatever. PERFECT place to get off your ass, take a little walk and lose some weight, right? Apparently not. I can't remember the last time my mom went out for a walk. And there are PLENTY of nice, flat, shady paths. I've brought up in the past Hey! Want to help me lose a little weight? We can go for a walk! Radio silence. 

Fuck, this is long. I'm so sorry. **Here is what I need:** I need a plan to confront my mom in the nicest way possible, explain to her that I am in NO WAY ready to bury her, that I love her more than words can describe and I need her to be healthy. My dad would fucking wither and die if anything happened to her. I don't know how to say this to her. She is very sensitive, she cries easily, she has the biggest heart (hopefully just figuratively at this point) but it breaks so so easily. If she starts crying, I will start crying and it will all just be a huge mess. Also, I kind of want to scream at her. I'm *angry.* All of this is just so avoidable, you know? Why isn't she taking it serious? She works her ass off on every other project she takes on, why can't she do the same for herself?


Please help me. I need a plan of attack. Please help me save my mom's life. She's such a good person, she's so fun and sweet. No shit, if you met her you would just adore her. The world will be a worse place without her in it.

22282,Non-Romantic,3hb3xp,"I met up for drinks with my friend and her husband late the other day at a bar. They had been drinking a lot of beer prior but I hadn't drank at all.  I haven't seen my friend much in a long while so, despite not really wanting to 3rd wheel it, I came out anyway because who knows when next I will see her.

Quickly into the conversation, her husband kept asking me questions about my new job. As a background, I work in research and stare at patient data in the form of spreadsheets all day. I look at some very high risk populations, older, sicker, that sort of thing. He was quizzing me to the point of being annoying. Why are they so sick? Duh, I work on a study of already sick patients... how do I not become like that? What do I have to do? Blah blah and after much interrogation (nagging) I blurted out that these people are sick, they're older and they are predominantly 50-60somethings who are overweight.  Don't gain weight. Eat healthy. I'm sure you'll be fine.

I felt shitty right after saying it because my friend, his wife, has gained quite a bit of weight over the last few months (unemployed, stressed, depressed). I really don't liken her to the people in my study at all, but her husband clung on to what I said and started nagging her.

He started first by going off about how overweight he is (he is not). He doesn't exercise and totally has the gut of someone who goes out to bars/restaurants too much, but I wouldn't label him as super overweight. His wife, my friend, however has... maybe gained 80+ lbs in the last year or two? Maybe less, probably more. I'm horrible at estimating such a thing but well she has gotten quite large.

He quickly turned his rant about being fat over to her. Started nagging her about her dietary habits, how she can't skip meals and just eat a ton of icecream in lieu of dinner, how she shouldn't have chocolate eclairs for breakfast, nag, nag, nag.  He wasn't aggressive about it; his tone was calm but it still came off quite callous...

I, still very uncomfortable with the conversation, was trying to play good guy and too was saying I eat lots of ice cream and is hard to eat healthy 100% and talking about macros in the general sense, but really just hoping the convo would change. After much of his nagging, she whipped out her phone and logged her daily calories into MyFitnessPal so as to appease him (while we're at a bar, mind you).  I took this opportunity to just talk to her about MFP in general.  This finally moved the conversation into other topics.  Phew!

I feel crappy.  I know I want to throw him under the bus as the one who really went off on her about her weight, but I feel like I totally instigated the whole thing.  My friend has a very long history of depression and lately has been especially bad.  Part of the reason I mention that I don't know when I will see her again is because she has literally been too depressed to hang out with me and our other friends.  Her excuses are I'm just not in a right place to hang out with you guys.  I would be no fun to be around and she goes radio silent for days/weeks on end.  She isn't working and just is cooped up at home all day (and could totally make time for me because she lives 20 min away--walking distance).  Lately, when she does actually talk to me, which is rarely, she has made mention of her naggy husband being super naggy and has even used him as an excuse in getting in the way of hanging out with me and friends.  i.e. she blew me off last minute one Saturday because he was nagging her about working on something she just *had* to do that Saturday--despite having every other day of the week to work on it... 

I know the whole weight thing is a small part of a bigger problem, but do I address it?  If so, how would I even bring it up?  I feel like I can just let it blow over and pretend it never happened, but that just feels shitty.  She is the type to wallow and hold grudges and so I'd rather just be upfront with her and talk to her.  That's what good friends do, right?

Any help/advice is appreciated.  P.S. not that it matters, but I am a tiny and skinny little thing and as such really hate the idea of friends' weights/diet/nutrition coming up in conversation (unless they ask for advice of course, as I'm a huge fan of nutrition science)!

22283,Non-Romantic,3g5ar7,"My housemate and I both work from home and have flexible work schedules. Depending on my work load and what I'm currently working on, I start my day at different times. Sometimes I'm working at 7am. Sometimes I don't get going until 10am. It's great, but there's one problem. 

No matter what time I get up and start my morning routine, my housemate decides that's when she needs to get up too. So when I'm making my coffee, she's right next to me making her tea. When I'm trying to make my breakfast, she's right next to me doing dishes. When I'm trying to enjoy some peace and quiet for just a few minutes while I drink my coffee, she's banging pots and pans. 

Now if you're thinking she's being friendly or wants company, you are dead wrong. She never even says a word to me when she comes out. No good morning. Nothing. She just comes out and starts her routine while looking pissed off as hell. I don't even know what she's mad about! I think she's just not a morning person, but her bad attitude really starts my day off on the wrong foot. 

At first I thought I was waking her up by being too loud and that's why she was mad. So I tried sleeping in later. Nope. Even if I wait until 11am, she comes out of her room right after me and does the same angry morning routine. 

So then I thought, maybe I can just get up before her and have a few hours to myself before she wakes up. So I got up at 7am. Nope. She still got up right after me. 

She told me once that she actually wakes up early every day. So on most days she's awake well before me and she's sitting in her room waiting for me to go out to the kitchen before she comes out and joins me. I don't understand her motivation, because we could both get through our morning routines much more efficiently if we weren't in each other's way. 

Lately I've just been getting up, starting the coffee, and then retreating back to my room to be away from her until she's done with her frantic morning routine. It works, but it's inconvenient and a waste of time.

22293,Non-Romantic,3fe5da,"I love my best friend. In our entire friendship, she has gone above and beyond to support me. She slept on the hospital floor with me when my soulmate was diagnosed with cancer. She was the first one to come to our house in the middle of the night on Thanksgiving when my sweet love had to say goodbye. (He was still in the room, too - it meant so much to me that she came to support me in such an intimate situation) I have had a mental illness for a long time and she visits me every single day when I'm in the hospital with my favorite food. I'm including all this info because I don't want the answer of just dump her which is likely after I describe her behavior.

 I don't think she is doing all this to be an awful person, I think something bad has happened in her life to cause her to act this way out of the blue.

For some reason, she has recently started to encourage me to do things that go against my morals and lifestyle. First, I have never eaten meat, dairy, eggs, etc. I don't usually bring this up because I don't want to make others uncomfortable, but she knows since we've been friends for such a long time. She keeps buying me food with these products in it. When I politely decline, she responds with Oh come on. Just eat it. I won't tell the cows. It is kind of weird to me, especially since I would probably get sick eating these foods at first. 

Second, she seems to be encouraging me to sleep with other people. One night, when we were out with friends, she made this guy come flirt with me and she pulled me aside and said he really wants you... I have a condom, take it... This is weird for 2 reasons. 1. I don't have casual sex as a matter of personal preference (though I totally support those who do!) and 2. I'm just not READY. I'm still living in the home I built with the one I love, with reminders of our life together that well... just isn't here anymore. My grief therapist told me that my actions at this point are completely normal - it's too soon to expect me to be over the blow of losing someone I planned to spend my whole life with. Why would she try to push me into this when I still cry like crazy walking past the yogurt isle at the store because it was his favorite food?

Finally, I have a mental illness that I absolutely 100% do not want to talk about, but I guess I have to mention it. My medicine makes my life normal. It is very strong medication though, and I can't drink with it. A lot of nights she will encourage me to skip my meds that night so I can drink. Also, people with this illness are strongly advised to not smoke marijuana due to a large correlation with the disease worsening, but she always pressures me into that too lately!

I'm not hanging out with her. I'm just so upset to lose her like this. What do I do?

22296,Non-Romantic,2cdmt7,"This story started near the end of my freshman year (which was literally last year for me) and annoyingly continues until now. I know I made a mistake and I know I'm young and stupid but this is just hurting a lot.

Background: I am a teenager from a slightly conservation Haitian family that goes to a pretty good school that my mom busts her butt to pay for. I have a bunch of older sisters and I promise all of this will matter in the story.

I met a boy last year during school and got into a relationship with him. We rushed a lot and ended up getting sexual pretty early. I know, I know. It was not the smartest thing to do and I feel bad for rushing into something that I clearly was not mature enough for (and still am not to a large degree) but at the time I threw caution to the wind and said whatever.

So after school for about 2-3 weeks I went over to his apartment until around 5:30 and left before his mom came home at 6. What we were doing was typical of young virgins trying to figure out stuff and had no penetrational (is that a word?) sex at all. He didn't want to have sex at first but tried twice with a condom later on. It wasn't happening. I thought we weren't doing anything terribly bad but boy was I wrong.

So one day in May we were at his apartment and were doing stuff and his mom came home early and saw us. Butt naked. With me grinding on him. On his bed. So much yelling was had and I was sent home. Got home and told my parents (because she would have called and told them and I rather them hear the story from me) and got in trouble with my parents and big sisters. Now the moment I knew I was not mature enough for all of this was went I got really sad and cut myself after being yelled at. I previously have never gotten in as much trouble before like this and I felt really ashamed to the point of doing that stupid thing as like a f-you, you don't need to hurt me, I'll just do it to myself rebellion/sadness type of way of thinking.

I knew my family was religious, to a degree, but I never knew they would react they way they did. I knew not telling anyone but my friends I was doing that stuff with him was bad but they made me feel like shit. They called me a whore, slut, threaten to send me to haiti, threatened to take me out of my nice school and put me in a bad one (which makes no sense considering I am an honor student who never gets in trouble), with my mom trying her best to hit me, and my father thinking I was on drugs and/or pregnant.

I know what I did was bad and I understand I deserved some kind of punishment but this is ridiculous! Take away my stuff and going out privileges, okay, but reminding me about it and saying hurtful stuff even until now, a year later, is not needed. I was talking to my sister about a bouquet of roses she got a month ago and this is the conversation.

Me: Wow, nice flowers. Who gave them to you? Her: I don't know. But they are nice. Me: Yeah. The person who sent them must like you. Her: Maybe but I know even then I won't go giving away my kisses like you.

Or something like that. I do know it was about what I did before and it made me feel so bad that she still thought bad of me like that. My parents and other sisters have said similar things like that also and I just don't understand why it's been like this. I've talked to them about it and expressed my regret and sadness to them but it seems like it has fallen on deaf ears.

Another instance was when my sister was holding my wrist and felt the scars and said why would you do that to your pretty skin. I'll get you something to help with it, my other sister chimed in and said no, I want her to learn and suffer from this. I hate looking at my scars because they remind me of such a stupid choice I made and feel bad about it too, I really don't need her to say stuff like that to me.

A part of me doesn't feel bad about it at all though. I had a lot of fun with him and was safe about it. I'm still with him now and am pretty happy. I've talked to my doctor, social worker, and school therapist and they're helping me. I feel like I've matured a lot throughout this also. I understand my family cares for me and are worried about my future but I think I'm doing okay.

Me and V have not been close like that since. (Apart from the occasional BJ and stuff) I've been killing it in school and activities and have put myself on birth control since I might have sex soon with him and I want to be safe. I think he's a awesome person and don't think I'll ruin my future by just dating him. I don't feel like I'm rushing anything but rather everything is going the way I want to. Going into junior year with hopes set on collage and a successful life. It has gotten better as time has passed but still sucks.

And help? Advice? Am I crazy/ Are they crazy?

Another TL;DR: Got in trouble with boy. Still in trouble. Feel horrible but enlightened in a way. Help with family?

**Way Back Backstory:**

I was raped the summer before my senior year of high school. I told one 'friend' and she told me that it wasn't a big deal and that it was my fault since I had been drinking that night. I did not speak to anyone else about what happened. When school started again I stopped going because my rapist attended school with me and actively sought me out to attempt to interact with me. 

My parents have always put school first so when I stopped going it greatly upset them. They did not know why I did not want to go to school. This really angered my father, who began accusing me of doing drugs and not putting school as a priority. One morning he even threw and dragged me down a flight of stairs to try and force me into the car for school. This time greatly damaged our relationship. 

I switched to a different high school and got into a great college. I did well and then took some time off because I switched my major and because I was very depressed, in a large part because of what happened in high school. I finally began talking about what happened in therapy and really began to come to terms with my trauma. I also told my parents about what happened to me in high school. It was never brought up again.


**Backstory to Current Situation:**

I started back up at school this fall. I was doing well. Then in October, my boyfriend (he is now my ex, we were together at the time) had sex with me after I said no. It opened everything up again. I began having panic attacks. I didn't break up with him immediately because I couldn't or didn't want to believe what happened to me and because I blamed myself. I did about two weeks after what happened. During this time my ex boyfriend came home with me to visit my family. 

I missed a lot of class and fell behind on my school work. I took a medical withdrawal from this past fall semester. I focused on trying to make myself mentally healthy again. I didn't tell my parents until this last week about the medical withdrawal. Now I realize that I should have, but I knew if I told them I took a medical withdrawal they would ask why and I did not feel comfortable talking to them about what happened. 

**Today and Current Issue:**

They were really hurt that I didn't tell them. I understand that and apologized. Today they came to my apartment to talk about 'serious things'. The discussion took a negative turn, and it culminated in my dad saying he didn't know what to believe anymore in reference to my ex assaulting me. I told him that was the most hurtful thing he has ever said to me. He then said that it sounded like an excuse for not doing school and cited the fact that I continued to see my ex after what happened. I walked away and didn't speak to him. He had a conversation with my mother and then went to the car. I talked to my mother for awhile. She said she told him to apologize but he felt that I didn't want to talk to him and that he wasn't welcome in my apartment. She then talked to him again, and he came and apologized. We all talked for a short while, then he told me he loved me and they left. 

I don't know if that was good enough for me. All my life my dad has said or done hurtful things and either refused to apologize or will do so and not change. Right now I really never want to talk to him again. But he's also my dad and I love him. He's a nice guy but has a lot of issues. I don't know how to tell him that the apology wasn't enough and that our relationship has been permanently and maybe irreparably damaged. 

**TL;DR:** I, a rape victim, was raped again by (ex) boyfriend. Father says he doesn't believe it happened, that it is an excuse. After talking to my mother he apologized. The apology wasn't enough and I'm still hurt. How do I communicate that? What will make it better? I'm so hurt and lost.

22324,Non-Romantic,26eql6,"It's making me so uncomfortable.

My dad and stepmom have been together for a year now. They've been fighting and arguing a lot.

Some background: My dad is on disability (severe depression, but he returned to work and has a job easier than his previous one) and my stepmom works two jobs. 

I have no job yet, but I am still looking, applying, and trying to make myself familiar with managers. So, I just help clean around the house and help cook if help is needed.

My stepmom is always suspicious of my dad: hiding his cell phone (from what she tells me) away from him, talking to other women... I have no idea. 

My dad says she's driving him crazy and is tired that she is always suspicious of him. Even asking him why did you turn that way? when he's looking out for traffic when he's driving.

When shit hits the fan, she throws all of my dad's belonging outside and ALWAYS threatens to throw bleach on all his clothes.

I try to think easy of her because she most likely gets shit at work.

What I hate, is that whenever she has a problem with me, she doesn't tell me. So of course, I have NO idea until someone else tells me.

This one was doing laundry. She said micheesie is 22 years old now. Why can't she do her own laundry? Why can't you teach her?

My dad started off with You just turned 21, right?

I was confused. Yeah, why?

Why did you tell R you're 22?

I didn't. She didn't ask how old I was.

And then he told me what I've said earlier. My dad doesn't mind doing my laundry. I always have little bit of clothes (which probably seemed a lot today because of my bed comforter).

And I appreciate that they do my laundry. I know how to do laundry. Hell, he doesn't have to do my laundry. I have fun doing it. If they really don't want to do mine, I'll have no issue doing it myself. But they choose to do it and don't complain about it.

I guess my stepmom is the one with the problem, but how come she doesn't *tell me anything?* I ask myself.

Then she will complain about it to her (very judgmental) daughters and disrupt harmony by causing unnecessary drama. 

Ugh she is so lazy why can't she do her own shit etc.

Lately I haven't been doing as much as I would like because I have an inner ear disorder (that is very slowly improving) so I get tired quicker, I am very dizzy and feel imbalanced 24/7. I've had this for 5 months now, and have greatly improved but I am still not over the depression about it. I still do dishes, vacuum, clean the kitchen, etc.

I would ask if she needs any help, or if she would like to get anything cleaned. She says no, and then later complains about it to someone else that no one helped her.

---   
**tl;dr**: Stepmom never tells me when she has a problem with me and complains about it to other people. Then I hear it from those people.

22326,Non-Romantic,2sf8q6,"My husband and I both make fairly good money (around $90k combined in a very low cost area) but have a ton of student loan debt (about 120k combined) that we still need to pay off. We have about 50k in the bank and contribute to our retirement plan. We rent a cheap place (600/month), drive low cost vehicles, don't take vacations, and live very frugally. We are planning not to have kids, since I would want to stay at home to raise them, and frankly, that's out of the question financially and I don't want to wait until I'm 38 to have kids, either. Adoption might be considered in the future. 

I come from a family that has always been incredibly poor (about 30k per year combined incomes)  with parents who always made sure that my brothers and I had moderate support throughout college/high school (we had a car to share, my parents let me keep my car for graduation, they helped my brothers with child support/college). 


My husband comes from a family that makes insane money and lives very frugally (close to about 600k per year income, 85k per year in pension, and millions in retirement/savings), but they never paid a dime for my husband (no car/cell  phone/college help. Nothing-apart from food/water/shelter until he was 18), and I doubt we will receive any type of help in the future from them (no inheritance expected), so my husband has no understanding of what it is like to have parents without savings, and he feels that we don't owe it to my family to help out. I feel that my parents sacrificed a lot to help me whenever they could, and I want to help however I can. I don't have any other friends in the same situation that I can ask, so I wanted to check out any advice from reddit. 


My question is this: My parents have almost nothing for retirement. Maybe 150k, if they're lucky. They're upside down on their mortgage and have about 10k in credit card debt/car loans. I feel that it is my responsibility to help them during retirement, but still feel like I am too young to really give a large chunk of money to them without feeling insecure in our savings. Does anyone have any advice on this/have the same problem? My brothers are all broke because they immediately bought a house (they can't afford) and had kids (they can't afford), so they have no savings to speak of. My parents have no inheritance coming their way, so I feel like I'm their only chance for help. 

**tl;dr**: My parents are unprepared for retirement, and I feel I am the only one in a position to help them. However, my husband and I make a lot of sacrifices (kids, vacations, home, cars) so that we can get a head start on our savings/retirement to avoid ending up in my parent's situation, so I don't want to go overboard with helping them and then end up in their situation 35-40 years from now. I'd also like to eventually travel, work part time, maybe adopt...
 Does anyone else have this same dilemma and/or any advice? I'm bummed because I feel like my parent's generation never had to worry about this stuff at all.

22334,Non-Romantic,2jor7e,"I will get straight to the point , as the title suggests my brother and his wife have last few months increasingly become more and more hostile towards me and I don’t know how to react. They got married during summer and honestly her behavior is what is puzzling me the most. 

My brother has always been very entitled and we never really got along growing up or later but the last few years our relationship was better maybe because we didn’t see each other very often. Some background. Two years ago I moved  and I am currently living with my boyfriend in a different country.I had a great relationship with my brothers girlfriend for as long as they have been together (close to 5 years prior to getting married ) although we were never really close. We would never go out alone or hang but we were getting along perfectly every time we met. Overall I saw her as the greatest thing that could have happened to my brother and I was hoping she would be the catalyst to making him a better person. If I had one reservation was only that this couldn't possibly last because she seemed so different than my brother. Kind , always polite and very considerate. I was therefore perplexed about her behavior towards her mother, which was always cold and always answering back with retorts.  I didn’t think too much of it because relationships with mothers are always complicated. Little did I know of how similar they actually were and that they are the perfect match for each other.

Right before the wedding  she was very agitated and would snap very easily. Again I thought nothing of it and said nothing because I was guessing she was under a lot of stress due to the wedding. Little did I know that this would be the beginning of what is now her permanent behavior. For 5 years we have had not even as much as a disagreement and 2 days after the wedding we had a full grown argument added and abated by my bother. The priest literally gave a hate speech that caused several of the guests to leave the ceremony .When I pointed that out they both snapped at me and told me that they thought it was ok and that I don’t have enough friends to know what is considered ok in weddings and what not and since they attend weddings all the time unlike me this is normal and I don’t know what I am talking about .Since I was only there for the wedding I decided to forget about it and move on. While I can respect their opinion even if I don’t agree there was no need to insult me by trying to make it seem I don’t know enough to have an opinion of my own nor does it matter how many more weddings they attend per year compared to me. Things after this however have only escalated to the worse. There is not a single time that we will be in the same room without them being openly hostile and ironic towards me. Since then I have returned to my country for a few weeks to finish my university degree. They are constantly making remarks of how I have left if for too long, and that the university is only giving me my degree because they feel sorry for me. I am trying hard not to reply to any of this because I am afraid if I do we will never have any relationship ever again and for the sake of my parents I am constantly allowing them to just say whatever they want glossing it over like I am stupid and I didn’t catch how they were rude and hostile. 

An example of my brothers behavior. I had to leave my car in my country two years ago before I left and my brother asked me if he could borrow it sometimes since he couldn’t use his. I have been paying for the minimum required to keep it running (he pays for its gas ofc) but he is completely acting like he owns it now and wants me to ask for permission to drive it when I need it quoting “only because I need it constantly and you don’t have anywhere to go while here”. I was expecting him to have gotten a new one by now not to keep borrowing it for two years but he seems to have settled with it and he isn’t even looking for one of his own. 


I don’t know what to do. The only time that I defended myself against all this was in the argument after their wedding and it seemed like if I had kept pressing it we would no longer be in speaking terms. I am ok with it because I don’t need this kind of behavior in my life but I am concerned about my parents. I don’t want to make them feel they have to choose sides and create awkward situations when I do visit. I know they agree with me but they keep telling me to ignore the remarks for the sake of our good relations. I was willing to do it but it has gotten so bad I have to leave the table to calm myself down every single time they visit. I really don't know what I have done to deserve this, I have not changed my behavior at all towards them!Has anyone been in this situation, do you have any advice for me?

She was always very harsh with me growing up, but I always thought it was my fault - that I was a crazy, mean and selfish daughter. As a teenager, I did make mistakes and lash out, but now I'm in my early 20s and she still treats me the same way.

She treats my brother way better than I do. He's had it so much easier, and it's hard for me not to be jealous or sad about it. I've brought it up and it's only caused us to fight, so I'm going to try to stop.

The issue is that living with her is very hectic, and I can't afford to move out even though I desperately want to. I don't know how to cope. I am very depressed, and lately I noticed it's gotten so bad I've been forgetting to eat (lack of appetite). I have 8 more months of university left until I graduate. I have to write my senior thesis this year and will have a heavy course load. 

She says/does a lot of things that get to me and that's how our fights break out:

* Plays loud music regardless of whether I'm studying or not
* Her alcoholic, drunk-driving boyfriend visits regularly and is always loud and drunk. He makes rude and sexist comments, treats like her crap, they fight a lot. 
* She thinks I'm the root of all the problems in her life: from her illnesses, mental and physical (You're the reason I have cancer!) to how she has no friends. She even used to blame me for her fights with her boyfriend, so I stopped commenting on him. Guess what? They still fought. Of course she refuses to admit it.
* She sees and knows how severely depressed I have been. She's mentioned it, but she doesn't try to help in any way. I just want her to listen to me or talk to me, but she dismisses me and talks about her own problems instead. She tells me to seek therapy because I'm psycho but doesn't acknowledge the fact that I've tried seeing 3+ different counsellors in university in the past 4 years.
* She tells me that she's the only reason I will graduate from university next spring, dismissing all my hard work and effort
* Doesn't help me financially but helps my brother, and if she does help, she holds it over my head
* Calls me awful names, won't listen when I bring up issues or ask questions, directly insults me and compares me to my dad (who she hates)

My brother being here usually helps, because I guess he gives us things to talk about, joke over, some sort of glue holding us all together. She bought him a brand new Macbook yesterday and I questioned her decision because she knows I can barely afford tuition/need financial help and that my current laptop is barely functioning. She got it for me used when I started college and it had a ton of problems I had to fix.

I feel very worthless and unloved living with her. I've been apartment hunting, I've gone to therapists, I've tried so many things and I feel like I have nowhere to turn. I can't even think straight most days. On good days, I just shut my brain off and watch Netflix. Bad days feel like the end of the world and I want to die.

MIL is known in the family for needing conflict like she needs oxygen. When she gets in her moods, the we all know to just ignore her antics. She had been trying to start a fight with someone, anyone, since yesterday evening. Nobody would participate. 

An example...this morning, she called her ~26M son at an hour that she thought would wake him up, to annoy him. (Watch me wake them up, as she dialed.) They were already awake, so she invited him and his GF to breakfast. The second she hung up the phone, she hurried to put everything away and clean up the kitchen. When they showed up and asked about breakfast, she got all huffy and they said, no big deal, they'd just swim with their niece and nephew (my kids). 

She tried and tried to start a fight, to no avail. Eventually, my 5yo son who hadn't slept well for 3 days and was overloaded with candy (because I was making nicey nice, no rules at Grandma's) started throwing a tantrum. My husband was handling it and everyone was basically telling her it was none of her business, but she wanted to jump in and discipline. She sees them 4-5x a year, so disciplining my children was out of the question. Neither of us were letting her participate. 

So, she decides to jump down my throat because I wasn't enforcing Honor thy mother and thy father with my son. I'm the quiet one, so I kind of knew she would be coming for me if nobody else would play ball. I explained to her that he would need to calm down before he could process a conversation about appropriate behavior, and that she was failing to recognize how tired he was. She then called me a shitty mother. She wanted a fight so badly that she had to go there. But I put everything, my entire existence into mothering so of course that hit a nerve, even coming from a mild psychopath. I began to pack our things which enabled her to put herself between me and the door. I exited past her once. 

A few minutes later, I was grabbing my (severe Celiac) husband's food from the downstairs fridge, which was behind a wet bar. She blocked the small exit and began spitting random bible verses and demanding that I answer whether or not I liked her, and asking how she could be a good grandmother if I hated her. (??) 

I tried to pass, and she put her hand on my throat to stop me. I was pretty spooked after that, wondering if I would have to defend myself against a 55yo woman? I backed up and ended up climbing over the bar to get away, knocking over two candle holders. 

She followed me up the stairs telling me how I was going to go to hell and asking if I liked her. 

I'm kind of shaken and I don't know what to do next. Is she a threat to me or my kids? Ignore it to keep the peace? Do something? I'm at a loss.

The extended family, as well as my husband, finds it easier to just ignore her. Although I do think that this time even he thinks she crossed a line. We're both just kind of unsure where to go from here. I'm not entirely comfortable just going on as if nothing happened, which is what happens after she picks.

I should mention that she is a doctor (a nurse-doctor, not an MD) and an ordained Methodist minister, and attends Catholic church. So, she looks good on paper. She has been attending AA meetings for years yet nobody in the family can remember when she was an alcoholic. She's very crafty and can likely talk her way out of anything. 

Any suggestions would be appreciated. 


TL;DR; MIL picked an argument with me because I'm quiet, and did some things that could technically land her in cuffs. Her side of the family kind of shakes their heads, as in, there she goes again. Not sure what to do next.

Now it says on shot may cause seizures. Prior to her first seizure, she was very quiet bookworm type of girl. Loved to do things with me and the family. After the seizure, as in 24 hours later, a different person. I should note she banged her head into many things (wall, tub, toilet) as she was in the bathroom and we didnt know she was seizing until we started hearing the banging noises. It took awhile to get her medically controlled, and then she was seizure free til my birthday last year. We switched her to lamictal xr, which has been a god send.

Current: She decided a few month ago to start working at hooters. Why? Who knows. I mean money obviously..but why there? No clue. But we supported her nonetheless. She had recently gotten back with her boyfriend and was seemingly on the up and up. In the past 2 months she has turned into someone none of us know. She goes from extreme highs to absolutely feeling empty and devoid of emotion. She hasnt mentioned wanting to die or suicide or else I would have committed her already. 

2 weeks ago: She was on antibiotics which made her stomach upset. Her Lamictal didnt absorb and she threw a chocolate bar (myoclonic jerk) in the middle of target. I knew she wanted to go to a party that night but I pleaded with her not to go, and if she did not to drink because of increased chance to seize. Alcohol can increase your probability of seizing. What does she do? She lies to me, her boyfriend tells us its a bunch of hooters girls hanging out. Reality? Its one girl and the rest thuggish looking guys. She gets shit wasted. Tells no one. I have to call worrying about her, she attempts to lie and say she is only tipsy. I call her boyfriend to go get her. He being the sweet angel he is, goes to get her, stops the car holds her hair when she vomits. He takes care of her. Doesnt yell or get mad at anything because he is more worried about making sure she is okay. He obviously felt betrayed but he just loves her. 

Two Nights ago: She lies, says she is at work. Goes and gets high with a bunch of the old thuggish line cooks. Then drives home. I am not against weed, but I am super against using anything then driving and risking your own life and other's. She lies to him. Lies to me.

She has no idea what she wants in life. She cant decide anything at all for herself. I feel like this is my fault for perhaps babying her too much because of the epilepsy.


She, honestly, thinks she is doing nothing wrong. Thinks she is god's gift to everyone. Hot young 19 yr old. Best girlfriend best sister/daughter in the world. Her extreme ups and downs worry me. 

What do I do? Who do I take her to? What if she doesnt want to go, which I cant force her due to her age. Could this be her medicine? Could this be her epilepsy? Is this a personality disorder?

Two days afterwards, my roommate decide to invite this guy into our apartment to smoke with him, As soon as I saw him I told him to leave, which he did. This triggered the first argument with my roommate - he didn't feel that he did anything wrong by inviting the guy over, and that what happened between us shouldn't affect his friendships. I explained how I felt about it, and he agreed not to bring him here again. I then messaged my ex (from a number he hadn't blocked) telling him politely that he could not come here again, and asking him to drop the clothes he borrowed from me off at my work.

Well, last Saturday he was here again - and I had to spend the evening at home knowing that that guy was sat out on my balcony. I decided it wasn't worth making a scene, so I just stayed in my room and confronted my roommate about it afterwards. Another argument ensued.

His position is that I have no right to be telling him who can and can't come into our house just because I have a personal grievance with them, and that I shouldn't have started anything with one of his friends because difficult situations were bound to ensue if we split up.

My position is that it's incredibly inconsiderate of him to bring this guy over despite knowing exactly what happened between us, and that if he wants to ignore me and refuse to give me my stuff back then I have every right to say he can't come into our house.

Things culminated in me saying that I'd call the police if I see this guy in my house again (he always has weed on him). I know that was possibly a bit crazy, but I really don't want to see this guy, much less in my own fucking home - and if neither my roommate nor him can respect that then what other choice do I have? 

My roommate and I have been friends for over a year, and have lived together for six months. I don't want to fall out with him, but I swear him bringing that guy here two days after we broke up was probably the shittiest thing a friend has ever done to me. We've been avoiding each other and haven't spoken since Saturday night. Am I being unreasonable? Is there any way of working this out?

OK, so friends for 6 months or so, we work in the same (postgrad student) office, did everything together, went for drinks, breakfast, walks alone she initiated loads of stuff, I thought there was a big chance she was into me, I massively like(d) her since about 4 months in. Took her out for coffee at the weekend and told her why I liked her and how I wanted to be more than friends, she said 'Until this point I have never considered you anything more than a friend, and currently I can't foresee that changing', so I'm reading that as her trying to be nice and saying not a chance. So that sucked, but now I'm actually feeling a bit better than I did before, because at least now I know and I can stop second guessing. I do feel like a bit of a dick for putting her in this awkward position though.

Last few days, I've chatted to her in the office, it is a bit awkward, but its not too bad and I've tried to keep my distance a bit and have been slightly less jokey than normal, I want her to know that I'm not going to try to convince her to like me or try to hit on her or anything, we have some 'in jokes', and I've been avoiding making them. 

**The situation**

So fast forward to today. Just received an invite on Facebook to a party she is having for her housemate's birthday this weekend. Its not big, 15 guests currently, and she's just invited everyone in my office (another 10 people). Thing is, and please tell me if I'm overthinking this, she can't really invite one person in the office and not everyone because we're all good friends, so if one person isn't invited it would be obvious, so while I'm invited I'm really not sure if I should go. So my options are:

1) Go - but if she was just inviting me to be polite then I could make the party crappy for her, and it would just be weird and awkward. I really don't want to be that guy who turns up and makes her say 'Urgh, why the fuck did *he* come!?', cause her to have a crappy night and it be my fault. 

2) Don't go - She knows I have nothing on this weekend, as I previously spoke about working Saturday, so by not going I *will* be making a point in some way, and she knows me, I never say no to house parties. This could massively increase future awkwardness. Also her housemate has loads of really cute friends and quite honestly, I want to go to the party (n.b. not planning on pulling in front of her or anything stupid like that).

3) Talk to her - This is a terrible option I feel as it sounds pretty self centred like she would/should care if I go to the party. I'm not going to do this.

Oh final thing is I'm pretty sure virtually no one else in the office will be able to make it, so I'm basically going to know 2 people there, one of which is her, there is going to be a lot of mingling....

Met her (lets call her sarah) when she was a freshman, and she started dating one of the guys in my social circle. We quickly became friends, but the guy has dumped her.

Her parents are absolute control freaks. She can never go out with friends, and she can't go outside very often. Even after school activities are prohibited.
Sarah also has a brother [16], that both of her parents quite obviously like better than her. They turn a blind eye to everything bad that he does, while punishing her for even the smallest things. She has been physically disciplined since she was a child (she still is - with a belt).

**Story:**

Recently, she's been quite depressed. Although there are many people who try to help her (myself included), she feels isolated and lonely all the time. She started cutting herself again (not too badly - thank god). After talking to her and spending some time comforting her, she has been getting (slightly) better.

However: Today, her Uncle (one of the only family members that care about her) has passed away, and she began to drink while locking herself in her room. After a bit of talking, she tells me that her cousin [~30 M] had sexually abused her when she was 6. Upon seeing him again at a family reunion, she had a panic attack and is now considering, once again, to kill herself.

She says her parents won't believe her if she told them (as they are abusive and insensitive), and that she has no idea what to do - as they will have more family reunions before and after her uncle's funeral.

I have no idea what the hell I can do to help her, and how the fuck do I talk her out of self harm? 
(obvious answer is to seek help from psychiatrist and child services, but I feel that'd only hurt her more as she will be even alienated from her family, and the kids at our school love to gossip and be jerks in general)

Paul's mom, my sister, has too much shit going on in her life to really be there for him. He hasn't had a good childhood. It breaks my heart because I know what that was like. I feel like I haven't been there for him during his life and it weighs on me. I've had my own problems but I could have tried harder.

Anyway, I wanted to surprise him with plane tickets to come visit us this summer. But I haven't seen him since he was five, I don't know much about him as he's quiet on the phone, and my mom is a pathological liar so I don't even know if anything she says about his personality, likes, interests etc. is even true (my mom is raising him right now). It sounds like he has some minor behavioral issues but I have no idea beyond that.

I want to give him a fun vacation, but more than that I want him to feel a sense of care and trust and acceptance from us to balance out the shittyness around him at home. How can I make him feel loved and accepted into our family when I barely know him? How can I make him feel relaxed around people who are strangers? How can my husband help him feel comfortable talking about guy stuff (Paul is really excited about the idea of an uncle-father figure to talk to)? 

I'm a mom but my child is still a toddler so my biggest crises right now are finding matching shoes and getting peanut butter out of car seats. I can't solve his problems or wave a magic wand over his life, but I can try to show him an example of another life, I guess?

I'm honest with my therapist but am too uncomfortable to talk about certain things I'd like to, like recreational drug use or specifics about my relationship with my boyfriend. Mostly we talk about family issues, and there's plenty there to be worked on so I don't feel unproductive after I visit him. However, I'd really like to tell him about my experience trying a pot brownie or that my relationship is deteriorating and ask for advice. Also, sometimes he brings up sexual topics and I feel uncomfortable discussing my sex life with an older grandpa-type figure. I don't have close friends I can talk to about these things, which contributes a lot to my depression and makes it more difficult for me to make progress in other areas of my life. I'm too embarrassed to tell him about my self-hatred, food issues, loneliness, etc. so we mostly talk about my relationship with my parents and how I'm doing in school. I also actively suppress my emotions, especially tears, when in front of him because I'm afraid of seeming hysterical and I want him to respect me. The last therapist I trusted enough to cry in front of and be 100% honest with was the worst woman ever who broke doctor/patient confidentiality and told my mom something which ended up causing horrible problems for me at home and I didn't know better because I was only 16 at the time.

I am divorced. My husband has custody of my daughter on the weekends. He refuses to give up his time with her, even if she has a birthday party or event. He would rather drive 30 minutes to take her himself and pick her up then let me. So I see her for 4 hours a day 5 days a week. My sister takes her to school and picks her up. 

I feel like my daughter is growing up without me. I hate it. 

I have asked to switch shifts, but I answer calls. My skills are not needed earlier so I am stuck from 10am to 6pm. 

Recently, my daughter asked me to come to her big game. It is at 5pm. I would have to have someone cover the last two hours of my shift. I used up all my off time when I was sick, so I cannot just leave early.

She said my daughter was not her problem. She was not going to work longer than she had to. 

I asked if another night would be better? 

She said not to ask her again, she was not going to cover my shifts. Even if my kid got sick, don't come asking her. She doesn't make a habit of covering parents' shifts, because I chose to have kids, not her. She didn't feel close enough to me as a person to make this sacrifice. I needed to stop asking.

I am furious, but think that this is just a policy she has with everyone. Then, not two minutes later, Gwen (29), asks her to cover a Friday shift. Kimber says yes without hesitation. What did Gwen want to do? Go to dinner with her husband. So because Gwen doesn't have kids this is okay? 

Gwen offered to cover for Kimber in two weeks when she is going to a concert. I wanted to punch them both in the face. WTF?

He called me later that afternoon and asked if I still wanted to go to lunch. And for some reason I said no I can't. He asked what's wrong and I just said I don't understand you. He told me he tried to talk me in the warehouse and I kept walking and he figured he would follow me over to my order, but then I walked away there too. He said he wants to get together and talk, and asked what I was doing Saturday I told him I have plans and he said okay, he will call me soon and we will get together some other time.

I have worked the front desk at a hotel for just slightly over a year now. About two months ago, I was promoted to supervisor although my manager had me take on supervisor duties about six months ago. I feel it's pertinent to point out that this is the first time I have ever been in a leadership position and that I am generally the only person in charge. The actual managers spend the majority of their time at another nearby property. Since the promotion, I have had some trouble with two employees who I am now in charge of.

We are all the same age (20) and attend the same university. The two guys, who we will call T and B, are also best friends (T got B his job) and are in the same fraternity. T and I got jobs at the hotel right when it reopened and have worked there the same amount of time. He has always done the bare minimum to get by while I have always done my best to go above and beyond hence I got a promotion and he didn't. B has worked with us for about 6ish months now. Before B got hired, T and I weren't really friends but we were definitely on good terms and could work together fine. After B got hired, they became slightly antagonistic towards me. I kind of just ignored it as I have never faced anything like this in the workplace and it kinda just stopped.

Before I get into their behavior, I just want to add that I am usually the bearer of bad news at work. The assistant manager who comes to check on us once a day, J (37m), is a really nice, always happy guy. The only issue is that he will come and relay good news to people and then have me relay any bad news after or reprimand people (think Chris and Ben from Parks &amp; Rec). So, already I'm seen as the bad cop. I feel like this might have something to do with some of the negative reactions I've gotten. 

Basically, since my promotion T has been very disrespectful. He pretends to flirt with me (I'm not a bad looking lady, but I **know** it ain't genuine) and constantly calls me things like sweetie or babe or toots. Even in front of guests of the hotel! He never called me anything but my name before the promotion and there was never any pretend flirting. If I go in the back for even a second, both T and B will immediately start slacking off (playing on their phones, playing paper football, or even *sleeping* at the desk). Also, at the last meeting I didn't wear my work uniform (since I had been off that day) and T made an inappropriate comment about the way my bottom looked in my pants. I have mentioned to J about them slacking off (I haven't said anything about the inappropriate comments...I feel uncomfortable talking about it) and he's really just too nice to really do anything.

I genuinely have no idea how to handle this. I have spoken to them myself about how they can't goof off at the desk and have tried to have J talk to them. I am considering starting to give them write-ups but I don't know if this is the right thing to do since I think it all stems from them not liking me to begin with and then me getting turned into the mean supervisor.

22486,Non-Romantic,2qw6yh,"Throwaway because it feels safer.

Around a year ago, I had career aspirations and found out someone I already knew worked in that industry. I asked for advice and she lead me in the right direction, gave me confidence to quit my job and gave me a foot in the door. I should mention now that this is contract/free-lance work, I technically work for myself.

Since the early days, I have learned the in's and out's of my industry, I've made friends that have been my guide for continuing education, I am making a name for myself and getting referrals from old clients. In the beginning, all my work was linked back to her in some way, but I just booked my biggest job yet all on my own. On top of that, I have my hand in other aspects of the industry and am in many groups that promote people like me. While my work isn't steady and I couldn't survive on the money I make with clients not associated with her, my own work is picking up and within the year, I feel I can be independent. 

In addition to my own personal growth, I've realized that she is the type of person in my industry I want to be nothing like. I feel like she rushes jobs, she doesn't talk things seriously, she acts like she knows all the answers, ect. I feel uncomfortable outting what I do exactly, but the way she regards the clients would be like a mom ignoring a child saying they are nauseated over and over again until the kid pukes all over the floor. Once the kid pukes, there is a big frenzy, but the mom could have just listened to the kid in the first place and avoided a mess. Basically, I don't want to be like her. I feel like her suggestions she's given me are cold and uncaring and I have started to ignore them. Clients do love her and I am not sure they see her services the way I do. Knowing what I know about how she works vs other people, I would not hire her. 

This last part is what causes the most issues. Part of her giving me a foot in the door in the beginning was her giving me hands on experience in exchange for doing unrelated (but paid) work. I now feel taken advantage of and I feel like I am being held back in my own personal growth while working with her. I recently picked up a last minute client in which I am substituting for another friend/colleague because she became ill. My mentor's response was along the lines of this is inconvenient for me, I'm sure it will work out but I need you more then client does. This would, again, be for the unrelated work that has nothing to do with my actual career, other than bringing in some money. 

All of this is causing me a ton of stress. I haven't left town in months because she needs me for so much of that non-related work. I miss my family and friends back home, but I feel stuck here. I do still get industry work from her, but again, my own clientele is increasing. Plus, I also feel my education has, in some ways, surpassed her. She has way more hands on experience plus the benefit of being older, but I have done so many workshops/trainings/classes plus I read constantly. Like I mentioned earlier, she thinks she knows everything. It's one thing to be confident, but I don't like what I see behind the scenes. She also regards my career as her side-job while this is my whole passion. I know she enjoys this work, but she isn't in 100% like I am. I would do my job 100 times for free because I love what I do while she charges absolutely maximum in the area and feels those who hire her are lucky to have her. Again, clients do love her.

I'm really needing some advice. I would love to ghost her but I do have set commitments with her (and clients of her's) until April. I would also feel badly quitting the unrelated work because of other people's (not her's) feelings. Should I cease agreeing to work with her past these few clients? Should I suck it up because she really did help me in the beginning and continues to give me paying work? 

**edit** I feel like this whole thing will be unsuccessful if I don't give any details to the work. Basically, I am on call (as is she) 24 hours a day for a period of time. When the client calls, you go. The unrelated work is childcare when she is called in to work. Her fear is that if I am on-call with my own clients, I may not be available for childcare. I think it's unfair that I turn down clients so I can babysit. She occasionally will give me scheduled times (when I say give, I really mean give, not are you available) and I am expected to be available. This has affected 1 job while I was working and keeps me from taking many last minute clients just in case.

22488,Non-Romantic,24f54y,"I'm a junior in college and we signed individual leases for an apartment in January for this coming school year.

In the past month I reached my breaking point with her. She was in a car accident (not her fault) and her car was totaled. After the accident, she told me matter of factly Oh, by the way, I will need your car to go to work on Wednesday from 4 PM to 11 PM. Umm, what? I was annoyed and lied about having an interview at 5 PM but grudgingly offered to give her a ride.

The next day I sent her a few random, chatty texts which she ignored, then later at night she texted me. Can I borrow your car this day and time for work? Well can you drop me off and pick me up instead? What about if I took this Monday shift instead? I made up excuses because I was annoyed at her only texting when she needed something, and assuming I'd a) let her borrow my car for 7 hours or b) chauffeur her around. Friends help each other. But her neediness (SHE HAS NO FRIENDS BUT ME) and not even seeming grateful or entreating (she EXPECTED me to drive her around) really rubbed me the wrong way.

Friday, we had plans to get dinner at 7. At 7 she texts me hey my shift is running late can we do 8:15? Come 8:15, sorry I'm still not done and my ride left. can you come get me around 9:20 then we can get dinner? At 9:20 I texted her that I was on my way NO! WAIT! Finally I said she had to find another ride. She replied oh, okay sorry. But it's not like she was really that apologetic, because she doesn't consider other people. How can you just string someone along for several hours on a Friday night like that? The next night we had a raincheck dinner, she was moody, and we spent 2/3 of it in silence. Like she was the one that should be mad.

Because she wasn't at fault, the insurance is covering another car. But she says she's going to wait until the summer to get a car because she doesn't want to deal with it right now. So she's just going to inconvenience other people and mooch rides off them for a month, because she just doesn't feel like looking for a car. Looking back I realized she's always been this way.

I've distanced myself from her in the past few weeks, stopped texting her asking to hang out and such, and she has made just about zero effort to text me first or initiate things. So I have hardly seen her/talked to her, whereas we used to see each other basically daily. I have a suspicion that her not initiating MIGHT be partly due to an inferiority complex. She is very socially awkward while I'm more outgoing, so maybe she feels uncomfortable asking ME to hang out now that I've stopped talking to her. Because looking back on our friendship I did all the initiating. But even if that's the case who wants a friend like that?

Since it's May everyone has their living situation/roommates for next year figured out. Well, I am probably going to back out on her. We signed individual leases so she can live there and it will not affect her financially in any way. And honestly, because she has NO other friends, it's not like I'm screwing her over, like she could have lived with so-and-so if I had told her earlier.

PLEASE tell me honestly, how unreasonable/bitchy I'm being. I want to have a fun senior year of college and go out with a bang. I do not want to knowingly live with someone who I will be miserable and monotonous with, and who spends every minute of her free time in her room because she is socially awkward. And I cannot bring her along with my other friends because she gets extremely uncomfortable and awkward... so anytime we hang out it has to be just the two of us.



---   
TL;DR - Signed individual leases for an apartment with a friend for the next school year. Just in the past month I realized that she's a bad friend. Doesn't feel bad for inconveniencing others because she only considers herself, mostly only texts if she needs something, rarely ever initiates hanging out. It's May, and nearly EVERYONE has their roommate/living situation all figured out and I'm planning on backing out on her.

22502,Non-Romantic,3i549j,"Hi guys, lately I'm not sure if I'm too emotionally unstable and overreacting, or if I'm justified to feel this way.

I broke up with my SO since grade 9 about a year and a half ago, and with her went a lot of my emotional and social support. As well as any of her friends I used to hang out with.

I've really struggled to feel happy and part of something socially. My best friend has been the only person I have been close enough to after her to open up to and rely on. We have 2 or 3 other friends that we hang out with (they are best friends), and together they are my only social group I'm close with right now. I've gotten closer to them since the breakup, but no where near as close as with my best friend.

The thing that really made me upset was this morning I woke up and got a Snapchat of all my friends in a movie smiling and laughing with a caption that said 'you missed brunch and the movie'. Then I check my phone and have one text message from 10am asking if I want to go for brunch.

None of us ever wake up earlier than about 11-12, like ever, so it really kind of made me upset that they didn't even bother to phone me (that would have woke me). And because they all got up and out so early I know they would have asked each other the night before, as they were all up late last night as I was texting him, and they didn't even ask me then so I could wake up. Or even bother phoning me after their brunch and before the movie as I live like 1 minute drive away.

I had a shitty week and I was looking forward to seeing them today as I knew they didn't work until tonight.

When I told him later that his Snapchat really made me upset as it kind of just rubs everything in my face and he would have had to go out of his way to think of me and send it to me, he just said 'sorry, I asked this morning' and we just talked about it for a bit, but he seemed really apathetic and confused as to why I would be upset by this.

Last week I also talked to him about how I felt like I needed to join a few clubs or something to meet new people as I don't feel like I have enough friends and people in my life right now that make me feel good about myself. He acted kind of offended and said that I have them to be my friends (referring to our group) and he doesn't understand why I feel like I need new friends.

But its like, stuff like this is exactly why I feel like I need more friends. I don't want to replace them, but if they can't provide the feel-good feeling of friends I'm looking for, I feel like I need new people in my life.

This isn't the first time he has been pretty apathetic to how I feel. For the last couple months he has been inviting his new girlfriend to everything I ask him to do with me, and I'm fine with her being there, but they act very isolating towards me, like I'm not there or third wheeling. I confronted him about this, and he just seemed kind of offended again and said they just want to spend time with me. I don't care that shes there, but the last few activities I've invited them too she has no interest in participating in, so he and her just sit out and it makes me feel shitty. Especially if its just the three of us or one other person.

I just always feel like I'm being a burden or I'm only ever valued when I can be of use to my friends. For instance, I feel like I'm only ever asked to do anything when they need someone to drive. Or I have the biggest house to do things in, so when they need somewhere to hang out.

I just always feel like I'm being a burden. And I know if I take a break from my best friend, then I'm not going to see my other friends either as they all do things together all the time.

I just don't know what to do, because I'm starting to get resentful and upset when I'm hanging around them because of all these things that make me feel bad, but then I feel bad when I'm not around them because I could be doing something.

I'm not sure if I'm looking for reasons to have a problem, or if these are things that are reasonable to feel upset about. I've left out a lot of the fun and good things these friends have done for me in this post.

22505,Non-Romantic,30aowz,"Hi everyone, I need some insight on this, I'm not sure what I should do in regards to my mother... To give you a bit of background on our relationship, it's always been a bit rocky between me and her. She's always been a lot more involved in my life than my sister's (mainly because I did a lot of tv/film stuff as a child and she would manage that). I always sort of resented her because she would coddle me to the point of literally stunting my growth... She would insist on doing my hair and makeup for me up until grade 10 because she said that she could do it better and that I wouldn't know how.


A few years ago, I started a charity, I'm really passionate about it and I'm glad to have started it. My mother (who is a stay at home mom by the way, she got sick when I was a baby and has been on disability ever since), insisted on helping me out with my charity because she was home all the time and she said I'd be too busy to do everything myself. Often I'd protest or say at least if you're going to do something give me some notice that you'll be doing so I can say yes or no. But she'd still change my website or make calls on my behalf and not tell me until later.

Okay, so onto the fight that happened earlier this week. I got an interview at a really high end retail store (we're talking $1000 dollar items here), and I was just mentioning to my family over dinner how I was planning on getting to the interview. I don't really get to say much of anything before my mother says I'm really not happy about that by the way. She proceeds to go on a rant about how I'm too good for retail and that she already emailed me some office jobs I should apply for and why do I ignore her emails and so on and so forth... She's literally screaming at me, and I'm trying to explain why I think it's a good idea to go for the interview (it's a good back up plan, I'd make good commission, I have a way to get there...) and she's honestly not listening. Which is quickly confirmed when she says wait will you make commission? And I said yes, I said that already many times. And then she proceeds to yell at me for not explaining myself and how I never share things with her. My younger sister (who is only ever nice to my mother) starts trying to reason with her explaining to her that I didn't have the chance to explain my job opportunity because she had interrupted and my mom snapped at her, she started yelling at her to shut up and that its not her business. My sister was so upset, and thats when I decided to go upstairs and comfort my sister who cried twice about it that day.

She's yet to apologize to either of us, the only thing she's talked to me about is about my charity and how she wants to take over a portion of it. I've been really cold and to the point with her, one word answers and all that. The issue is tomorrow is her birthday and i don't know what to do. My sister doesn't want to ignore it but I don't feel right just letting her yell at us and ignoring that it happened. I'm really upset being yelled at when I'm honestly just trying my best. I don't think I'm a bad daughter, but I'm made to feel that way constantly.

22517,Non-Romantic,2uzlm0,"My [26/f] boyfriend [25/m] (let's call him Jay) and I have been together for about a year and a half and have lived together for a year.  We were also best friends for years prior to us dating (it just kind of took us awhile to realize we would be good together!).  Since we have such a great relationship and have been living together for a year, our parents and friends have begun asking us when we are going to get engaged, married, etc...and we are unsure what to say...

Now, Jay and I have discussed marriage and all the necessities we believe should be agreed upon before marriage (kids, finances, religion).  We are in sync on marriage discussions, live together wonderfully, have great relationships with prospective in-laws (who also get along great with each other), and have stable, successful careers.  We also do not want to have children until we are married.  Outwardly, we seem to be in an ideal place to get married, but, for us, we take marriage incredibly seriously and want to make sure any kinks are worked out before walking down the aisle.

Our only kink is communication.  Due to our personality differences (he's your typical introvert and I'm extroverted), we have had difficulties communicating on the same level and are currently working on it.  I'm in therapy due to my own issues and my therapist has helped us work on getting our methods of communication to a compatible level.  Over time, we have gotten much better at communicating with one another, but we want to make absolutely sure we are at a level that would be successful long-term.  For both of us, we do not believe in divorce, unless there is abuse or infidelity involved.

The issue is...what do we say to people when they ask when we're getting engaged?  We, obviously, *do not* want to tell them the real reason getting engaged isn't in the cards yet, but every other possible reason (finances, time, differences in values) everybody knows is not an issue with us.

Thoughts?  I know this seems like a silly issue, but we do not want our friends &amp; family to think marriage is not on the table because we do love each other immensely and want to get married some day...just not right now!

22521,Non-Romantic,253s4u,"So my SIL is kind of a difficult, angry person. She and my brother had been dating for about 10 months when she got pregnant with  my nephew. My brother had already been living with my mother (he's a hard-working guy, but not particularly motivated to move out, and really likes comfortable situations) and grandmother and my SIL moved in when she got pregnant.  She was really surly and difficult throughout the pregnancy.  

It's a big house with 5 acres of property. I moved back home for a year at the time of the pregnancy to sort out financial debt and get my life back together after my ex-fiance and I split up. My SIL and brother had known each other for quite a long time prior to dating, so we knew each other and weren't exactly strangers. But she and I always had a tense relationship. 

 My nephew was born, and I was ecstatic. But beyond my own joy, I was so happy for my mother that she had a grandchild now. See, my father had died five years before that, and my mother is a long-time cancer patient who has gone through many rounds of treatment after getting and losing remissions.  For several years after my father died, it really seemed like she had lost her will to keep fighting.  My nephew coming into the world was a ray of sunshine in her dark life, and it was wonderful to see her enjoying life again.

About my mother: she's one of the kindest, most generous, unassuming people I know. She was a nurse for 25 years and has a gentle, healing nature that made her extremely good at working with dying patients.  She always has a bed for people who don't have anywhere to stay.  She loans money if she has it, lends an ear to anyone who needs it, and gives freely of herself.  She is kind, and I don't know anyone who can say a negative word about her (until SIL showed up). The other side of that coin is that she has a hard time sticking up for herself, and kind of lets people walk all over her and take advantage of her.  I naturally feel very protective of her.

For the first 8 months of my nephew's life, I lived there, and took on many parenting duties because my brother and SIL were working, and I also wanted to bond with him. He was my little sunshine.

I moved out mainly due to my SIL's difficult nature, but also because I was ready to get back on my feet and had my debt paid off. I still tried to maintain a close relationship with my nephew. My mother was like his third parent.  She gave my SIL and brother free child care seven days a week, didn't charge them rent, let them live in her house (SIL did the cooking and cleaning and bought most of the household food and supplies, though, so they weren't totally freeloading). Still, my mom basically surrendered her house to my SIL.

Problems with SIL's attitude (very dark, moody, sarcastic and often verbally abusive to my mom and grandmother) arose early, but really escalated when my mom started suggesting that they get my nephew into daycare a couple of days a week so she could have some free time. My mom is, as I said, a cancer patient.  Chemo gave her neuropathy in her feet, and she has fibromyalgia to boot, so she can't exert herself too much or she has a lot of pain. It's hard for her to constantly chase after an active little kid, as much as she loves it.  Plus, he needed to be socialized with other kids. SIL was pissy and mean about it.

My mother finally stood up for herself. Told her that she wanted my SIL to be happy and that she loved her and my brother and nephew, but that she would not tolerate being treated that way in her own house. 

Well, my SIL retaliated by putting my nephew in daycare five days a week, and never letting my mother see him. She and my brother moved into a trailer at the back of the property, and whenever she needed childcare, she would drive my nephew 45 minutes away to her own mother's house instead of leaving him with my mom. 

Meanwhile, I live with my boyfriend and two stepsons (7 and 4). They've been in my life for two years now (their mom only gets one supervised visit with them per week), and they and my nephew think of each other as cousins. We spend holidays, vacations, and birthdays together. My oldest son's birthday was in April. I sent out the invitation and my SIL didn't even bother responding. I had no idea my nephew wouldn't be there until my mom told me the day before.  The saddest part is that we just moved to a new town and my son still hasn't really made friends.  There were only two other kids at his party.

  I let my SIL know I was hurt but that I understood she had other plans that day. I told her that I loved her and that I was sad that she was having these problems with my family.  That I wanted to help however I could.  She responded coldly that they already had other plans when my invitations went out and that it sucks that my son didn't have many other kids at his party.  That was it.

Well, I told her my youngest son's birthday was in May and we hoped to see them there.  We are having the party down in our old town at the boys' other grandmother's house, so it'll be easier for everyone to come. I sent the invitations two weeks in advance so people could plan. This time, she responded to the invitation (at least there's that), saying that they'll all be dirt-biking that day, but to let her know what kind of gift my son wants. 

I don't know how to respond.  I'm extremely hurt that my own nephew won't be at either of my sons' birthday parties this year. Moreover, my kids will be disappointed too.  At least other kids will actually be coming to this party, so perhaps my 4 year-old won't really notice, but that doesn't really make me feel any better. My SIL is effectively cutting my family out of my nephew's life, and I have no idea why.  My mother was kind to her, let she and my brother live with her and dominate her house for five years, and my SIL treats her and my grandmother (a 93 year old woman!?) like shit. My brother has barely stepped in and I realize that's a huge problem.

I have no idea what to do.  Do I respond to her?  Do I just say something like Oh, that sucks. Have fun.? Do I tell her how I really feel or will that just make things worse? I just want my family to be happy, and we would be if my SIL wasn't behaving like a beast.

TL;DR My SIL is feuding with my mother because my mother doesn't want to be verbally abused in her own home. SIL is using my nephew as a weapon, keeping him away from my family. Won't let him come to both of my sons' birthday parties this year.

An example of this is that recently on of my friends invited his crush out to the pub with us, his crush happened to be an old friend of mine and we spent most of the evening chatting, this wasn't out of a conscious effort to 'steal her' (to paraphrase my friend) but just because we got along well.


This happens fairly regularly, I make no special effort with the girls, we just tend to get along quite well. This does fairly regularly end with them trying to dance with/kiss me.

My dad never wanted to be a dad really, he was more of a reserved, private person. He was a class A narcissist, I suppose you can say. Most of my life he belittled my brother and I and called us mistakes, but he had custody of us since our mother was an alcoholic and didn't want us. We spent our childhood doing everything ourselves.

About 3 years ago, I went on holiday for 2 months. Dad was quite happy about it and helped me pack. I went away for 2 months, came back and my dad was gone. The entire house was empty, everything was dark inside and it confused the heck out of me for days on end. I ended up calling his landlord and she told me he planned on moving out for 6 weeks. I was devastated because I couldn't comprehend what was happening.

I finally found out where he went off too. His home country. My dad is Malaysian and my brother and I are part Malaysian and Euro, so his family always hated us for not being full-blooded. My own mother had to ring me up and tell me this herself, like she could have done ages ago. His mother apparently came to this country and brainwashed him into coming back home to look after her. He did.

Anyways, I spent the next 3 years trying to contact my father to no avail. His sister messaged me on facebook telling me he had died and I was incredibly depressed for a while, until my mother (who is technically still legally married to my father) found out that he is infact alive, but wanted to make an excuse for me to stop contacting him. My mother made huge points on how he came to this country to find a better life and we ruined it. I was sad, but moved on.

I now have the question that I haven't had closure on... Why is my dad like this? I don't understand how people can close off their own family, tell them he's died and go and have a new one like nothing happened.

22531,Non-Romantic,1u5n69,"My Mother’s [63] and my Father’s [66] relationship has been getting worse since my Father retired about 18 months ago. He’s an alcoholic and has been what you could call a functioning alcoholic for years, however it’s getting worse since he retired. His drinking leads to him being snappy and very off hand with my mother; he puts her down (often referring to her as stupid) and has reduced her to tears on an increasing number of occasions. So far he’s never reduced her to tears in front of me. 


I think my Father has depression, I have myself and know the signs etc, and he’s always been emotionally distant; he’s never hit any of us but has always been kind of domineering; in retrospect he’s fostered what I would call a culture of fear where none of us had dared criticise him or his actions. He can’t take any form of criticism and goes into a mood and refuses to talk to you – this has lead to a belief that it’s just not worth the hassle and keeping quiet when his actions are out of order. 



For example you know how they say you get more right wing as you get older? Well it’s true in my Father’s case, these last 2 years he’s become increasingly racist, sexist, size-ist, convinced that people are victimising pensioners and has grown to become easily scare mongered by the media about Muslims etc. My Mother and myself are fairly liberal and so stay quiet rather than agreeing with these outbursts. 



I’m 31 only have a part time job (despite having two degrees) and obviously live at home after my housemates moved out and I couldn’t afford the rent by myself; they moved in with GFs rather than it being because of me btw. Last night, New Year’s Eve, I had a bad back from work and so took a few beers up to my room with the intention of sleeping early. There was a knock at my door and my Mother said she’s put food out, I decided to get some and instantly noticed that the atmosphere wasn’t right. My Father made some snarky comments and sat in his chair silent, my Mother started crying. Whispering I asked her what had happened and their incident was over nothing basically; she hadn’t come to look at the hedgehog in the garden as quickly as he’d have liked as she had hot trays of food in her hands – he also referred to her as stupid again. I told her it was the last time he’d ever make her cry and he wouldn’t do it in 2014 and she nodded; I also asked her if she wanted me to take her away right now and she shook her head and we tried our best to assume normality. Often they do too and things blow over quickly and so I retreated to my room to give them some space. It didn’t seem to blow over last night but this morning things are back to being ok. 



I’m ill, not from the booze I hasten to add, but they seem ok today. However, my Mother came to check on me and I asked her how she was and she said fine, he’s being fine etc – but that she’s now thinking of leaving him and we would talk about it later when I’m well. 



I now feel that it’s inevitable that she will decide to leave him in the coming year; I feel sooner rather than later – maybe within 3 months. I will leave with her and make sure she’s ok. My sister lives across the other side of the country so I could take her there for a while, it’s probably where she’d end up anyways and we can see about getting her a house there etc. 



I have no idea how to deal with my Father during this time, both initially and during the longer period. Any advice regarding this would be appreciated. 



I also have little idea what I need to do to make things easiest for my Mother, getting her away and what help is available to set her up in a new home if it comes to that. We’re in the UK so any advice regarding that would also be appreciated. 



I still love my Dad, but have grown to dislike him, I doubt I could raise my hands against him.



**TL;DR** – my Father is an alcoholic and his behaviour towards my Mother is tantamount to abuse. I feel that her breaking point is soon and she and I will leave my Father, I’m stuck in the middle but feel deep inside that her leaving him may be for the best as he’s not going to change.

22539,Non-Romantic,2nkiji,"Okay, so heres the story:

I organised to go to the casino with a couple friends (4 of us) awhile back as I was invited by my cousin to go and he asked me to bring some friends as a celebration for finishing year 12. 

One of the friends (the one in the title, i'll refer to as X) the night before we go invites another person into the facebook chat where we discussed the details for when we go out. Me and this person do not get along whatsoever, so I shortly removed him from the group.

Soon after we have a fight over facebook about how X thinks I'm being a dick and I explained to him that we don't get along and I don't want to sacrifice my happiness just so he can tag along and spoil the night for me. X decides he isn't going to go.

The rest of my friends bail on me as well, I was pretty pissed but let it go as another friend opted to come with me instead, so we went and had a good time with none of the original members going except me.

Now heres the issue, the next day X goes out to the exact same place with the friends that I had asked as well as the guy i don't like, and they snapchat me the night away. I was really cut about this, I mean, who wouldn't be?

I haven't spoken to X since then and he is making it out that I am acting like a little bitch for taking this personally, who is in the wrong here? Obviously i left out some stuff but I wanted to keep this semi short..

TL;DR: Ask friends to go out, one convinces them to not go out with me and instead go out the next day with someone else and im upset... Who's in the wrong?

22559,Non-Romantic,36imp3,"My father has always been a career-driven man and has achieved great success on a financial level. He went to college, worked his ass off for different companies, while getting even more marketing/economics related degrees and schooling in the meantime. Now he is a high-positioned manager of a high-end company. He is deeply respected by his colleagues, peers and family.

On the other hand, my relationship with him is quite awkward. Until I was 12 I stayed with my grandparents almost all the time, he was always busy with work and my mother also, she came to pick us up in the evening, my dad used to come home late. Through high school it was about the same story. I lived at home then because my grandparents got older. 

He would come home late in the evening, and I didn't really see him much. On the weekends, I mostly was out, so I just saw him at dinner or lunch. On the other hand, he was always very critical for someone I didn't see often. He made remarks about my appearance, which was quite normal, my grades in school, which were fine, and about my sarcastic humour which really made him angry. He takes offense really quickly and takes himself very seriously, so when I poked him in a friendly way once in a while, which he did with me also but I didn't get angry, he went nuts.

He then started to throw the most vile insults at me, literally the worst things you can say about someone on a personal level, and belittling me. I was just a spoiled little asshole without any crudentials yet who should know his place, according to him.

Now I'm almost finished with university, and his behaviour actually got worse. I'm home a lot now because I have few courses left, so I really see things clearly now. I have a younger brother and sister. My sister is 22 and lives in another city. She is the only one who still dares to criticise him face to face, and underwent serious repercussions because of that. He threw a dinner plate at her a year ago during an arguement about something trivial. My brother has autism and ADD and has a hard time studying. 

My mother helps him during weekdays, but at the weekends my dad helps him sometimes, getting furious at him when he's not paying attention or when he's gaming too much according to him etc.

The last couple of months I was under serious stress because of school and my anxiety I struggled with came back hard. I couldn't sleep, lost weight and felt very ill. I could count on my mothers sympathy and help, but my father ceased to be sympathetic after about a week. He told me I'm an egotistical, whiny, spoiled weakling who should grow up and act normal, and that he would kick me out of the house if I didn't.

I still struggle with the anxiety but I dare not to speak about it when I'm around him because he gets angry when he hears about it. It also seems like he can't stand the fact that my mother got slightly more invested in me because of it, it's almost like he's jealous of the (actually unwanted) attention I get because of it.

On the other hand, he occasionaly states that he's just worried about us and that he just wants us to become healthy, normal-functioning adults, and that's the reason why he's on our case most of the time. I used to believe this, but after all this time I started to notice that his verbal abusive methods rather took a toll on my self-esteem, which I also start to notice in my younger brother, who is in a mental weaker state than I am, which worries me.

He did a lot for me, I never came short of something, but I can't deny the bitter feelings I have towards him.

TL;DR: My dad was always on our case in a verbally abusive way, because he wanted us to become healty, mentally stable adults. I believe he achieved the contrary.

22569,Non-Romantic,27uhmi,"I'm writing for advice for my husband because he isn't a redditor and I thought you all could shine some light on how he could approach this situation.

I apologize in advance because this is going to be a long one. First, some backstory on our neighbor, Jerry. My husband moved in next door to Jerry back in 2010 (before we were married) and Jerry immediately took a shine to him. Now, Jerry has always been loud and obnoxious, at times offensive, is typically drunk or in the process of getting there, and has a very hard time respecting personal space and boundaries. Since he's retired due to a work injury, it seems like engaging us even at inappropriate times was a source of entertainment and provided him some interaction with people. Outside of the woman he lives with, Dawn, who we had assumed to be his wife, Jerry doesn't seem to really interact with anyone. Though Jerry got on our nerves, he's not a bad guy and has always been willing to help us out when needed. 

Dawn herself has a lot of health problems and isn't very mobile. Both Jerry and Dawn rely entirely on his Social Security benefits and some kind of leftover worker's comp he received when he stopped working due to the work injury; I'm not sure, but I think she has some Social Security income, as well. Due to her bad health, Jerry is basically Dawn's caretaker the majority of the time. They both have adult children from previous relationships, but none together.

Anyway, my husband and I moved out of the house in the fall of 2012 and have since turned it into a rental property. The renters moved out recently and my husband was at the house doing some improvements this evening when he got a call from Jerry. Jerry was drunk (not a surprise) and crying (very surprising). My husband told Jerry he could come over if he needed to talk, since he was obviously really upset, and came outside to find him on his porch crying. When they go inside to talk, Jerry reveals that he was diagnosed with terminal cancer two weeks ago and the doctor said he had between one and six months to live. 

Here's the tricky part: Jerry said that the hardest part has been that he hasn't told Dawn yet and that my husband was the first person he'd told. Jerry asked my husband what he should do, and he replied that Jerry should absolutely tell Dawn immediately. Jerry doesn't want to do this because she has enough health issues of her own and this will just add more to her plate. 

And it gets even trickier: Jerry told my husband that he's concerned for Dawn because *they aren't married* (this was a big surprise) and so she will receive none of his Social Security or other benefits when he passes; because of this she will not be able to afford their mortgage and other bills. When my husband suggested they get married now, before he dies, Jerry said that they couldn't and it would just cause more problems. 

At one point during the talk Jerry expressed interest in suicide, to which my husband responded that it would hurt everyone who loved him and that it isn't an option. Jerry said he knew that and wouldn't really do it; apparently his son killed himself a long time ago and Dawn's brother recently committed suicide so he knew personally the effect suicide has on loved ones. 

Jerry was drunk and very upset during this conversation, so when my husband asked him to elaborate on some parts of this (what kind of cancer he was diagnosed with, how Dawn and Jerry marrying would cause more problems), he kind of just dodged the questions and my husband didn't press him further. 

I'm very worried about Dawn in this situation - she will have her entire life as she knows it wrecked by this if she gets blindsided by his death in a couple months with no time to prepare or get his affairs in order. I imagine because she has children one of them may be able to take her in, but without any notice that Jerry is about to pass and that they will need to take in their mother, this could really mess up their lives, too. 

My question is this: what should my husband do in this situation? Should he try and talk to Jerry again tomorrow, hopefully catch him when he's more sober, and talk some sense into him about telling Dawn he's dying? I would do it myself, but I wouldn't want to betray the confidence Jerry put in my husband.

22602,Non-Romantic,1svtnk,"A friend of mine has cheated on her fiancé in various forms/times over the years.  The most recent time, she got drunk, slept with some guy, and (for the first time) admitted it.  Her fiancé kicked her out, they were breaking up.  She had no money so she stayed with friends for a few days, then decided she wanted him back, so apparently she quit her job (she was already planning on quitting eventually FWIW), went and lived with his family, and they were back together within the week.

Since getting back together, she has done a complete 180, stopped drinking, stopped going out, started going to church, and now spends her spare time doing things like making Christmas cards for sick kids.  Don't get me wrong, these things are all great things, that had she chosen to pursue at any other time, good for her.  But she didn't.  Instead she cheated on her fiancé, basically trickle truthed him, letting him believe this was a one off time that can be attributed to her being blackout drunk (rather something that has happened many times, drunk or sober), and now they can live happily ever after.

I feel like they were so close to her actually coming clean and getting a fresh start, or just breaking up, because frankly, maybe they need to.  Now they're acting like it never happened.  

I, on the other hand, find the whole thing a little absurd, have lost respect for both of them, and I don't know how to treat them anymore, if nothing else it's awkward. We used to all hang out quite a bit, and I've been avoiding it since all of this.  She seems to be a totally different person now, and though I know it's not my business, I can't help but resent the fact that rather than trying to fix the actual problem, they just slapped a giant bandaid over it, pasted on some smiles, and moved forward with the wedding (early April).  I feel like we're all in for a huge dramatic shitshow in the future, probably after they're married with kids.  

So, presently, here I am expected to help plan and participate in bridal showers, bachelorette parties, and a wedding that I can't entirely get behind.  I could opt out, but that's pretty effectively destroying our friendship over something that I fear ultimately isn't my business.  Do I go against my gut, plaster a smile on my own face, and plow forward?  Talking to her seems to be out, she's pretty dead set on all of this.

I feel that I don't love my family at all, but I don't hate them at the same time. Not at home? Meh. Going overseas? Meh. You are sick? Meh.

Backstory:
I don't feel close to anyone in the family at all, which includes my father, my mother and my brother who is 6 years older than I am.

Since I was 9/10, my mother starting sleeping with me. I didn't really think about it when I was younger, but it's just that my parents have really bad relationships. They don't even talk to each other now and I guess the only reason why they aren't divorced is cause things are the way it is and my housewife mom only has my dad as her income.

My father is a workaholic who leaves the house at around 7am and comes back at around midnight and later. He has his own company thus he has free rein of his working hours. He doesn't come home on weekends these few months to go fishing. He told me that he comes home late so he wouldn't have to meet my mom and quarrel, so my brother and I wouldn't get nagged by my mom for reasons like not keeping the house clean and stuffs like that. I feel irritated whenever my dad talks to me for I don't know what reason. The only time we communicate is when he sends me to school in the morning and when he's at home and I'm awake.

My mother is a housewife and believe she probably has some sort of depression or some PMS and will hence go apeshit before her menstruation. She will scold me for no reason or for really petty things and and that really ruins my day. You know, she will just shout in the kitchen, walk to me while I'm using my computer, scold me for being on the computer all day long and rant about how I'm her nemesis and I'm just there to make her life terrible while brother is a terrific person who will help her with everything(when he was younger lol).
I feel that my mom places her friends higher than me. She doesn't decline what her friends ask her to do and she comes back home to rant at me. Maybe I'm the petty one here but there was once she told me she will buy lunch home and she was late for hours as she drove her friend around to buy something her friend wants. She just wants to appear as the nice person in front of her friends. Also, maybe I'm being petty here again, but she kinds of treats my brother better in some situations. I'm reasonable and I feel that my mother is not a bad mother and she treats me good, probably better than other parents but I just feels that she treats my brother better at times.

My brother is currently in his university hostel so I only see him on weekends. We are close when we go out together, like when we eat dinner together, but at home, since young, he had no interest in interacting in me at all. This is most likely due to the age difference.

So most of the time, the house is just my dog and I since my mom goes out for exercise and stuffs like that. Honestly I don't care if anyone's at home or not, I don't even care if I have a family, I have become extremely rational to the point that to me, family is just a source of income and kind of pride.(you know, everyone has families)

I absolutely support my parents if they want to divorce. My mother has an emotional affair with someone overseas(they have met before, and I know the guy) and my dad probably has a physical one, though I'm not very sure about my dad. I feel irritated at that,

My family? Meh.

TL;DR 
hardly talks to dad. 
Mom probably has mental problems and goes apeshit before her menses and during her apeshitness I really feel like leaving the house since she blames me for everything that went wrong in her life . But once she goes back to normal she goes normal again. She has an emotional affair.
Hardly talks to brother. Has some bond with him, but just hardly talk to him. I hate him at times.
I feel no love for my family.

I really hope this isn't just some oh you are feeling this cause you are going through puberty kind of thing. I'm happy about my life since I don't care about my family in general.(but specifically, yes I do care, like if my mom cuts herself I'll help her with a wound and things like that.)
Really conflicting thoughts. Now I'm just going FML FML FML.

22609,Non-Romantic,2wifln,"Backstory: I dated my ex for just over a year and although he is not the father of my child, he did play that role as he was involved in her life from the time she was 1.5yrs. His parents were very involved with our family and grew extremely close to my daughter. 

Recently, my boyfriend and I have split due to his emotionally abusive behaviours towards me. He is very narcissistic and only thinks about himself which resulted in him repeatedly putting me and the baby last after himself, his friends, work, etc. 

His parents support him fully, financially and emotionally and even though he is 27 he still heavily relies on them (they co-sign for apartments, new cars, and large bank loans). This always bugged me because I am fully independent and don't like relying on others; however, I tried to understand that this was their family dynamic and appreciate the help his parents offered. 

My issue now is that since we have broken up a lot of things have become very obvious. He has been walking all over his parents since the day he was born and instead of stopping him from treating them, and anyone else he gets close to poorly, they simply enable him, and defend him, no matter what he does this includes: past substance abuse, current substance abuse, stealing, lying, partying, and a general disregard for how his actions affect those around him. 

Recently his parents have reached out to me after a month and a half of radio silence, they want to see the baby. To be fair, they do love her a lot and she does love them a lot, they were all very close. My issue now is that during the whole breakup ordeal, I felt like I was hung out to dry by my ex and his parents and when I went to talk to them about seeing the baby(to see what their intentions are) they refused to apologize or even acknowledge that they or their son mistreated me. 

They also have a daughter who I am close with, she does not get along with my ex (her brother) and because of this we have a good relationship and she and her husband still see my daughter. 

I am at a loss, on one hand, my daughter would LOVE to see them, she loves them very much and she doesn't have a lot of family on my side. On the other hand, these people seem to have real issues with facing reality and were okay with their son mistreating me and my daughter. I also think involving them would possibly confuse my daughter who is still probably confused about where her dad is (she doesn't know anything but this man).

Am I wrong to want an apology/some acknowledgment for what happened? Should I let these people see her? I really only care about what's best for her but this whole situation is really hard one me and I have enough to deal with as it is.

We were eating lunch at her house and the kid came in with blood all over his hands. He said that he had met a sick stray cat and he had helped it feel better. My sister was at first pretty worried, but as  the day went on she laughed it off. 

It's not only the cat thing... this boy is .... off. He never laughs and doesn't have any friends. He stays in his room with his books all day. He had toys, but never plays with them. He just likes books, which isn't an issue, but he is 9 years old and doesn't play or have friends and never has? The books he likes are usually history books about wars that have happened, and he seems pretty interested in Holocaust books. I am all for learning, and being interested in that sort of stuff, but I don't think I would be okay with my kid wanting to know about the horrific details of war... that's all he seems to talk about. He learned that I visited a death camp in germany, and he picked my brain about it for 2 hours. He wanted every single detail of the trip. What happened there, what the chambers looked like, what the tour guide told us. 

 I have only seen him smile during family movie night, and it's usually not because the movie is funny. It's usually something bad happening to a main character. He says he thinks it's funny because the acting is so bad... for example: we watched the 3rd harry potter movie and he was laughing when Hagrid thought his pet Buckbeak  had been executed... he said that Hagrid was a bad actor. I might be biased, but I think that's weird.

22629,Non-Romantic,3cf0jm,"TL;Dr I return home to be there for my mom which was diagnosed with cancer. My father and sister behaviors are childish and disrespectful and they keep bothering my mom with their drama while she is in critical condition.

 I traveled overseas to completed my education around 2011 and since then I have only visited my family once in Dec 2012. As I remember I wasn't really happy with the visit because of all the drama, but it was for 3 weeks and I did it to see my mom. Back to 2015 and a week and half ago my mom sounded really sick over the phone  and I started to ask her what's going on until she told me that she have cancer and she has been through multiple operations and having complications. She said she didn't tell me because she didn't want me to leave school. Anyway I pack and arrive here last Thursday. I check on her and move to live with father and sister in an apartment close to the hospital.

 The problem is the way my father and sister treat each other and treat me is just unbelievably childish, irresponsible and disrespectful. I am thinking this stupid . so my sister starts to be disrespectful to me so instead of fighting I tell not talk to me again and I effectively ignore her. 

The Problem Is that they keep bringing this BS to my MOM which she's in the hospital in a Critical condition. They keep complaining to her and telling her to talk to the other person and what not. They just driving me crazy. I mean they can fight all they want I don't care but don't bring that childish BS to her. She can't handle it, she has high blood pressure and diabetes plus cancer.... 

I tried to talk to my father to tell him to not to talk to mom about anything. But he just keep doing it . and the sister she is the biggest cry baby ever, for god sake she's 29 and acts like 9 and I just don't know how to handle these two babies for my mom sake.
I am seriously thinking about renting my own room or apartment. Any Advice on how to handle and negotiate two people how are bitter and dislike each other.

My daughter and him don't have a close relationship. As I was walking in to the kitchen this afternoon, I overheard my daughter thank him for alcohol that he had purchased for her. He offered to buy her more for her and her friends for New Year's.

22661,Non-Romantic,2dre0k,"It's not because my friends have an alcohol abuse. But since alcohol is and will always be part of the Danish culture, in which alcohol is used as a way to socialize with others, I find it hard to feel good or as part of the circle when I say no to alcohol. Luckily, there are some who both agree and understand why I have chosen to distance myself from it; because my culture does not allow alcohol in such a wide scale. I'm not used to that in every social setting, and still a bit surprised when alcohol is being offered or included. And when I find myself in such a setting, I feel rude, or like a party pooper, when I say no thanks. 

I have often tried to explain to my Danish boyfriend how I feel when alcohol consumption occurs, especially when I'm not even a part of it. And I told him that I think it's provocative and irreverent when some of our mutual friends still choose to buy beer or drinks for me when I explicitly said that I do not want to drink that evening. It's as if it seeps in through one ear and out the other! 

And tonight, my boyfriend's out with the boys and get wasted. And of course he can hang out with the boys and drink beer until he throws up, but the mere thought of it affects me to such a degree that I don't even feel like texting or talking to him when he needs to be like that. 

I really want to be a person who doesn't have to be this way. I want to be a part of it all without feeling uncomfortable and provoked by others' alcohol consumption - and either choose to go home early or get completely wasted with the others, just to feel like a part of it all! I really want to go out without feeling like a person who just has to be towed, or ruining the party, because I don't drink that often. Do you have any advice for how I can participate more actively in social settings without feeling like this?

As it stands right now, there's no talk of a sub letter. He comes from a wealthy family, and it seems like they're pretty cool with just eating the rent for the option of coming back for the occasional weekend. However, the utilities split is unclear, and I'll lose the internet because I can't really afford it on my own.

A good friend/previous roommate of mine, Dave, ended up on a month-to-month lease at a place he'd like to leave. It seems like the perfect situation to replace James with Dave (James saves ~800/month in rent, I keep the internet and don't pay more for utilities), but I don't know how to bring it up without coming off as happy about it. It's pretty obvious that I'd rather have lived with my old roommate (couldn't for logistical reasons), and between James dealing with mental health issues and being a less than ideal roommate (very sloppy, didn't do chores, etc...), there was always a bit of tension bubbling under the surface.

However, he's still a friend, and I wouldn't want to hurt his feelings. I also don't know if he wants to hold on to the room in case he eventually wants to come back or something. Truthfully I'd really like to live with Dave, and James leaving really does feel like a relief, but the situation is sensitive. I could see myself feeling hurt if I was in his shoes (like the new roommate is an upgrade). How do I bring this up without coming off like his leaving is something I'm happy about?

I'm having a really weird feeling in my stomach, because I'm scared to lose friends, and other relationships. 


I am a social person and I can get along with everyone. The thing is that most of my relationships are pretty shallow. There are many people I know which I see at work, school, etc. but I don't hang out with. So there is no deep relationship and I'm not putting much effort in keeping those relations and neither do they. 



Besides that I've a couple of good friends which I occasionally hang out with. They have their own group of friends, but we are always there for each other. 



And finally I have my group of friends, including my best friend. They all go to the same college, I go to a different one so they are closer to each other then I am. We don't always share the same jokes and so on. We've been on a holiday together twice, we go out together, etc. But I am afraid I might lose them. 
I'm afraid that I will end up alone. 

I've known my best friend for seven years now. But is he really my best friend? We've never referred to each other as best friends, he doens't open himself much as he is kind of reserved. 

Three years ago I was best friends with a girl who thought I was developing feelings for her and she cut all contact with me. That was the first time I've felt like this before. 


My ex also dropped me out of nowhere six months ago, which really hurt. Since I got along with my ex well, we became friends again two months ago...and yet last week she cut all contact with me, because I hung out with another girl (as friends wut). And now I saw on her snapchat that she possibly has a new boyfriend, which hurts like hell. 

Now the group of friends I always hang out with, including my best friend do stuff together without inviting me. I know they have plans tomorrow, but they didn't invite me. I don't know why they didn't invite me, and I'm really scared to lose them as I know them for five years. 


Girls wise, I normally would speak to girls but the last two months I haven't had a single text conversation with girls, besides one girl who I know quite well. Though this girl also seems to contact me less and less. 


I'm scared that I will lose all the people I care about. It's really hard to get deep relationships with people here as everyone has their own group of friends. I don't know what I'm doing wrong, and right now I'm scared as hell. What is wrong with me? What should I do?

I have a childhood friend that I’m growing concerned about.  We both grew up in the same town and our families and ourselves were very close.  We have baby pictures together and were attached at the hips during our toddler up to about middle school when our parents decided to send us to different schools.  We reconnected during high school but we were both hanging out with different crowds.  But through all of that afterschool we’d still try to hang out and did stupid highschool kid shit like smoke out behind the haystacks or underage drinking out in the dirt fields.  I use to have a huge crush on him in high school days we did fool around a bit but nothing was too serious. .  Just some heavy petting and that’s about it.  He graduated a year before me and left to the military and when I graduated I married right after high school and left our small town.  That was back in 2000 and through the years we started growing apart again but due to our adult lives now taking form.  We’d still keep in touch with a phone call ever 3-6 months.  This is when I found out he was going to get married with someone he met over while stationed in Germany.  I was stationed in Hawaii and it was a last minute thing that he sprung on everyone by bringing his lovely bride to the states and getting married in our old hometown.  My dad and my brother who was still living there at the time attended the wedding and they called me after they wed so I can congratulate him.  I was a bit hurt but whatever I moved on.


Then they got a divorce and I was also going through a divorce myself.  He was getting out of the army and going into the national guard and I was getting ready to go back to California to go live with my mom after I left my husband.  I called him up and we started hanging out like old times again for the next 6 months.  It was great and we really enjoyed each other company or so I though… And then all of a sudden the communication starts to dwindle and I find out that he is dating an old highschool classmate of mine.  I asked him about it as we talked about it and he said he wanted to be with her.  I was a bit confused because I didn’t see this coming at all but for some reason I wasn’t mad at all.  I asked him if he just saw us as FWB and he said yes but that he really wants me to be happy and hopes I can find that with someone that was worthy of me.  It actually made me feel good that he said that and I was happy for him.  I also said “ok fine but just know that I love you and will always have a special place in my heart for you even if you don’t feel the same way.”  We gave each other a passionate kiss (nothing sloppy) and said our goodbyes.


Same thing again… we kept in touch over the years every 3-6 months and I got involved in a pretty serious relationship.  Durning this time he decided to marry the girl and I had a really bad feeling about this.  I voiced my opinion about this and talked to him about this for a couple of hours and all he could say that it was his life and he was happy and just asked me to be happy for him.  I respected his wishes and left it be.  I was invited to his wedding and it was a small wedding with old high school friends there that I hadn’t seen in years.  It was kinda sad as well too because during the reception when they were asking people to make speeches over the mic no one wanted to say a thing… not even the best man or the parents.  So I stood up and congratulated him and basically tried to save face for him telling him how happy I was for him that he found happiness and blah blah blah.  I faked the entire speech just so there wouldn’t be some awkward silence. That was several years ago… 


Well I go and get into a serious relationship and have a kid with someone and the happy couple (or so I though) even make an appearance to my baby shower and my kids first birthday as well.  We still talk every 6 months or so and I even talk to his mom to see how he is doing and his kid that he had with his second wife.  I find out that they are doing miserable and that they are getting a divorce.  During this time as well I left the father of my kid because I found out he was cheating on me and I was not having any of that… and once again we reconnected but things were definitely different.  We talked about maybe giving it a try but trying to figure out the logistics of it all and decided that it’s not going to happen.  He had a career going in our sleepy little town that started to expand and I started a career in the bio-tech industry that had no market in our hometown.  This was back in 2011 and we start to grow apart again.  I didn’t hear from him in over a year or so… and I moved on to someone wonderful that I’ve married and now in a pretty good relationship.  We have our ups and downs but we definitely are on the right path of getting our lives together and we have a great respect for each other.  Well we still kept in touch once a blue moon and I find out when we decide to get some drinks with his sister who just moved to my city.  I asked my husband if he wanted to go and he said no and to go and have a good time catching up with my friends and he would watch the girls (mine and his) for the day (I don’t like being away from my husband or girls at night).  Well we meet up and I find out from him that he is engaged to another girl and is going to get married again.  I straight up told him that I’m not ok with this and that he really should not be jumping into this.  That his last two marriages were crap and that he should really think about this.  They were only together a year and she is I believe 10 years older than him.  From what I heard from his mom and sister (who I kept in contact with this whole time) that they didn't like her a listed off a million reasons.  I asked him what his family though about this and he said he didn't care but wanted my insight since I've been there since the beginning…. 


I straight up told him I didn’t like it but he is a grown ass man and I can’t make this decision for him.  I also told him that he can’t keep on calling me out of the blue just to tell me that he is getting married again and wanted to let me know.  I told him I moved on and that if he really wanted to stay friends not to call me when he needs some relationship advice.  I guess I got upset about this because I still kinda loved him but now in a brother sister way.  I didn't want to see him get hurt… I told him if he ever needed someone to talk to that I’d be there for him.  So I finished up my drink and left.  I was upset that he was going to get married again and that he was going into this blindly.  His sister came out and she saw that I was pissed and told me that I should be the one marrying him.  I told her not to ever say that again because I’m married and I will never leave my husband for him.  I’ve told him I loved him in the past but he moved and so did I…


He caught that last sentence as he was walking up behind us to see where we went.  He apologized for being a dick in the past to me but I told him to save it because I don’t see him romatically at all.  Just more as a brother figure… 


Same thing… we kinda keep in touch once in a blue moon… That was a little over a year ago… 


Now outta the blue he texted me at 3:30 in the morning stating that he needed to talk.  I get up and give him a call and ask him what’s wrong?  He is in shock that I called him and is sobbing telling me how fucked up his life is… how he feels bad he didn’t die in Iraq and that he is sick of the courts not letting him have custody of his daughter (after the divorce with his second wife she left the state and is basically raping him in child support and he lost his GI bill).  His new wife is going out partying and drinking all night and hangout out with other guys and is asking him to pick her up from the bars after his night shift from the hospital.  He tells me that after he picks her up trashed from the bars he puts her to bed and goes downstairs to his garage to drink himself stupid and starts talking about killing everything and everyone is out to get him…


I let him rant for a good 30-45 minutes and mind you it is now almost four in the morning… I ask him if he thinks he might have PTSD from serving in Iraq and that maybe its time to stop caring about girls and to start caring about himself.  


Then he drops this bombshell on me:
“I can’t stop thinking about you and I really miss hanging out with you and just talking to you.  I miss you so much.”  


I straight up told him that I’m sorry that he feels that way but I’ll never leave my husband for him and that I’ll be there for him but not ever in that way… He had his chance twice and that ship has sailed and was destroyed in a horrible storm.  I also tell him that I can’t do anything for him but secretly my heart is breaking for him.  I want to fix his problems and I’ve never heard him cry like ever…but I don’t know what to do… are there resources that I can get in contact with and somehow help him if he is suffering from depression or PTSD?  I know he drinks way too much and I’d like him to get help with that as well but a friend can only do so much 150 miles away and also I have a family myself that I will always put first… 


TL;DR:  Childhood friend that I use to have a crush and still keep in contact with on and off on is reaching out to me.  I’ve moved on but it seems that he hasn’t and I don’t know what else to do… and now he is showing signs of PTSD and major depression.  What resources can I give him to help him?

A little background about this first: My mom has had drinking problems ever since I was little. From my recollection, it started after things got bad between her and my first step dad. When she drinks, she would yell at me about absolutely nothing, slap me across the face more times than I can count, she was extremely controlling when I was younger yet tried to act like a cool mom. I moved out of her house, and into a boyfriend's house when I was 17 because I just wanted to get away from her so badly. She still holds that against me and says how hurtful that was.


I became independent at such a young age because I just wanted to be out of her control. Now, I don't really talk to her that much, but our relationship is somewhat more stable because of that.


She is now with my second step dad but not really since they never officially got married but have been together for a long time. They live together, sleep in separate rooms, and talk about how they both want to move out. He has drinking problems too (has punched a hole in the wall, which my mom tried to lie about and say it was my brother). They have always been a horrible match for each other, they always get drunk and start verbally abusing each other. 


I do spend time with my mom on holidays, such as Easter and this past Mother's Day. But the last two times I have hung out with her, they have left me regretting so. On Easter, we went to lunch where she had clearly been drinking. She was being so emotional and dramatic about something we were talking about, and my younger brother (he still lives with her half time, he always calls her about about her drinking) were just sitting there like great... 


This past Mother's Day, I didn't get her a card because I am kind of short on money (college student) and I didn't think she would mind once I told her it was because I was short on money. I could tell she had been drinking before we got to the restaurant, so after two glasses of wine she started her usually repetitive, not really making sense conversation. I ended up getting irritated because I kept trying to tell her the same thing over again. We left and then she told me that my boyfriend needed to get out of the car to say hi to her when he was in the middle of the road with cars behind him.


She then texted me saying something along the lines of Thanks for making this the worst Mother's Day ever... I hope you have a better day at your place of living (I just moved in with my dad/step mom), don't contact me :D (literally with a smiley face).


I replied saying I didn't do anything wrong and she replied yea didn't even bother getting me a card


I have always had such a stressful relationship with my mom, and now I feel like I can't even hang out with her without it turning into some dramatic event because she's drunk and me ending up feeling like shit. 


I am even more stressed out because I use her taxes for my financial aid (I can't use my dad's because it says he makes too much) and I feel like now she's going to use this against me. 



I know the source of all of this is the fact that alcohol is involved, but I just have such an emotional past and present with my mom that I don't know what to do at this point. It stresses me out when I shouldn't have this kind of stress from any of my parents.

I knew my workplace wasn't great but now I'm realizing it is downright dysfunctional and it doesn't look like it will get better any time soon. After posting this, I was told that a new supervisor will not be hired anytime soon once my current one leaves. And guess who will be taking over all of her duties for the next month or two? I immediately got in touch with a staffing agency who places people in my field and I have already heard back from them. I have an interview with the agency on Monday and I was told they have a few clients who have positions open that I would be good for. Putting in my notice as soon as possible. 

After college I worked in retail for about 1 1/2 years and then began working in a health administration office. I worked in that office for 1 year and I loved my coworkers. The office had a great work culture and people got along well with one another. I would have stayed with them but an opportunity at another organization opened up and it was a chance for advancement. I took it and have now been working at my current job for about 6 months. 


I am totally shocked by the attitude of my coworkers and the problems that this organization has. The organization I work at is tiny. There are 10 employees (8 full-time, 2 part-time). Here is what has happened since I have been here:


- My department, consisting of myself and 2 other people, are kept out of the loop. Changes in policies, events, and so on, are told to us on the day-of with no warning. The other department will often leave their offices to go out for coffee or whatever and not tell my department. Sometimes we will be calling their offices during the day to ask questions or talk about projects and discover that no one is there. (Their offices are a bit removed from ours so we don't know when they leave).  


- Any tasks that the other department doesn't want to do are given to my department. We are all treated like administrative assistants even though that is not what we are. It seems like my department is given extra things to do on a daily basis and it makes it very hard to get our work done.


- Since being here, I have gone through 3 supervisors. The first quit after 1 month. The second quit after 4 months. The most recent one just put in her notice. They all cited the same reasons for leaving: they didn't feel supported by the other department, they were exhausted by the lack of communication, and they didn't feel they had the proper resources to do their jobs.


- I was promoted after 2 months of being here. It was because the first supervisor quit so they needed someone to take on some of her responsibilities. I was given a new title, and more responsibilities and authority. I received no pay raise and no extra benefits. They are still paying me at the entry-level rate even though my job is not remotely entry-level.


- The other department of 7 people has a bad attitude and can sometimes be very mean. 2 women in particular are the ones who seem to be behind most of it. They make snide and passive aggressive comments at my supervisor and I about our work not being as good as theirs. They openly gossip about others. One time they were directly outside of my office and my door was open. They could clearly see that I was in my office but were loudly lambasting another employee. It made me very uncomfortable.


- One of those women who I mentioned above didn't bother to learn my name, and was calling me what's-her-name for the first 2 months I worked here.


- Myself and my department have repeatedly asked our boss and other department if things can change. We have been asking that they be more open about communication, if we could hire another employee since we are very under-staffed, and if they could give us less extra tasks to do. No one seems to listen or care. They have mostly responded by telling us to try harder.


My questions is, is it normal to work in a place like this? Should I get out now? I honestly don't know if I was just spoiled by my first office job and was very lucky to have worked in such a nice place. Or, if I am working in a bad environment.

22746,Non-Romantic,2pulz5,"Hello. I am from a foreign country, so english is not my first language. 
I (17f) live with my father (30s m), my stepmother (30s f) and three half siblings (7m, 5f, 1f). 




My life was very complicated from the start. My bio mom got pregnant in highschool at 15, my dad was the same age, they went to the same school and were friends since they were little kids. My mother`s parents wanted an abortion but my dad`s mom (dear grandma!) wanted to keep me, so she convinced the family to do so. I ended up in my dad`s mom`s house, where my father lived too with his siblings (all teens, they moved out as soon as they went to college). They looked like my older brothers back then. Grandma was very strict with dad, made him go to college against his will but he dropped out and got a job. Dad got married whe he was 22 years old to my stepmom and they had their three children.  Dad, SM, my siblings and I lived together with grandma in her big house because of my father`s economical problems, but she hated my stepmom and didn`t get along with dad, she said they were ungrateful. Grandma was difficult but I love her, i was her favourite. Sadly, she died recently and it was the worst day ever. She left me her expensive house in the will, which has been a disaster because she had other children and grandchildren that forgot.  Gradma also left some money (I will use it to pay for college). My dad got pissed about the all thing but seemed to get over it. Currently, we still live like when grandma was alive: all together. My father pays the bills and is the sole provider of the house. I live with the money that grandma left me. I will own technicaly the house when I turn 18 in a few months.






Besides this issue, my dad had been wonderful too me. My dad was always there for me, helped me with homework or whatever I need, gave me emocional and financial support as long as I can remember. My stepmom became a mother figure and treated me as her own daughter.  I help them babysitting and love my siblings as my own children. They are really important to me, even though I loved my gradma the most. 





I have a big issue though. I am like gradma. I want to be perfect. I was bullied all my life so I always wanted to get all good grades to prove myself. I do great with school. When I fail, I punish myself. I was fat, so now I am... complicated with food. I watch every calorie, work out like crazy and put emphasis in my appearence. I am always with make up and clothes I like. My stepmom worries that i am almost anorexic, but I do not think I am. 
It does not help that my best friend is like and ana nightmare. 






My dad started a new job recently in constructions and I went to visit a couple of times. He looks really young (in his 20s) and I am tall, so I look in my 20s too. Some of his coworkers though i was her girlfriend because he gave me a hug or something. When my stepmom went to pick him up, a stupid coworker told him: You changed the young sexy bomb for the four-eyes fatass?? (I do not how to traslate it right). My dad punched the coworker, was fired and now he has another job. My stepmom felt terrible and got angry. She nows feels selfconscious about the glasses and her weight (she gained it during pregnancies and couldn`t shake the pounds off). 





Now, my dad and stepmom blame everything on my behaviour. They demand I wear appropiate clothes, no make up and act according to my age. They also brought up my supossed eating disorder and said i have to be a role model to my little sister, so my stepmom is cooking healthy to lose weight and forces me to eat two times a day. 





I am trying to help my parents with the kids, I also try to help my stepmom to lose weight (we go to the gym together). My best friend says my stepmom is jealous of me and wants to bring me down, she also says I should kick everyone out when I turn 18, so I can live the dream of having a 6 bedroom old home to myself and do what I what, were the make up  and clothes i want,not eat so much, get some roomates and party (all of this while my family is in the streets???). I will not do that, I will move away to the college campus and get a job to help me with the expenses. My best friend doesn`t realize my family is all i have besides her, since I broke up with my boyfriend, my grandma died, my mother forgot I am even alive, I do feel lonely.

Aunt Belle [72]: eldest daughter, rich, Parkisons and severely disabled  
Uncle Cecil [65+] second eldest son, is out of family life, never meets up

Aunt Fran [65+], fourth eldest daughter, doesn't live close, meets occasionally  
My mom [60+], youngest daughter, lives close   
My uncle Gary [60+], youngest son, lives close  


At one point or another almost everybody has been on non speaking terms with others, mostly about etiquette things, nothing major.


Uncle Gary was always considered the fuckup, basically being without a job for a long time, being coddled, complainig that set him back and that's why he's still a bachelor etc. etc. He has anger issues. 


As I child, I was crazy about uncle Gary, because he had some of the same hobbies that I did and I thought he was great. However, a few years ago he had a fall out with me. I'm one of the main caregivers for Aunty Belle, and we were going to go on a joint holiday. He send me this poem extolling his concern and I send him a polite e-mail back stating that I was well aware of his concerns and I thought I'd do well, thank you for mailing me. He then stated that maybe he had gone a bit overboard, I send him an email agreeing with that and stating that after a long absence of contact, I'd had appreciated an e-mail inquiring about me more. He went off the deep end and told me he needed 'space'. I've seen him around, but stopped sending cards for his birthdays. He is also estranged from my mom and my sister. Basically, we all find him very high maintance and I think my life is better without him.

**&lt;Actual Story&gt;**


So, now that all that backstory is out of the way, two years ago, uncle Gary hit auntie Ellen on the front lawn of Auntie Belle's house. Since Belle is in an electric wheel chair, there isn't much that she could do and she felt devasted and upset. Auntie Ellen basically fled the scene. She told me later, that years ago, he had hit her too (I was unaware of that) and that's why her mom asked her to repair the relationship between them on her deathbed. I had thought their years long silence and fight was about something silly etiquette like.


Auntie Ellen so far, has had panic attacks, flash backs and isn't doing so well. She used to baby sit me, but we weren't that close for the next few years. At Christmas Eve that year, me and my bf were at auntie Ellen's house to take her to her Church. Auntie Ellen has come by because she felt safe enough, but she has tried to avoid Gary at all costs. They do live close though and she told me she feels he continues to harrass her. 


Last year Belle celebrated her 70th Birthday in a big restaurant, so there was a huge buffer and both brother and sister were invited and it went off without a hitch. This year, however, she wanted to have a party at home and of course, shit ensued. She invited them both and Ellen said she wouldn't come. Her solution: her sister is not welcome at the party then and can come a day earlier. My sister will be there with her child on that saturday, because she can't be around hectic situations yet. But it won't be a party atmosphere.


My mom has told me that she finds this perfectly fair, because why do you have to choose between your bother and sister? Just invite them both, and if that won't work because Ellen won't come, just move Ellen to another day. I told her I find this blaming the victim, it's perfectly reasonable that Ellen is scared and wouldn't want to be around Gary. Asking them both on the same day, is condoning the abuse and making sure Ellen is excluded. Changing her to another day is just letting her be treated shitty, while she did nothing wrong. Obviously my mom didn't think of it that way, but now has something more to think about.


Aunt Fran has said outright that she thinks aunt Ellen is at fault. After all, getting hit straight to the face is allowable because she apparently egged Gary on. Classic Victim blaming.


I've had many talks with Ellen, stating again and again, that nobody deserves to be abused, and that I'm really sorry she's still having so much trouble in her daily life because of it. It was heart breaking though to hear her say that she'd miss me at the party, because I won't be there and she is disinvited. 


I don't want to stir shit, but also, I am sick and tired of this victim blaming bull shit going on and my integrity demands I do something, the question is what and how. Relationship Reddits, help me out here!

Not a day has gone by since we were officially together that we weren't with each other. We've spent very long periods of times together, grocery shopped, cooked, done laundry together, etc.

We met in community college, her 1st year, my 4th year, and I just got accepted to a university 2 hours away which I have accepted admission to. My parents have always been against me moving out, but since this is for college, they are completely for it. They're being really supportive about it, and are willing to give me loads of free stuff, say I can come back any time, I'm always welcome, my bed will stay, I can do laundry here on weekends, etc. And I want to keep that support.

However, my girlfriend and I have been talking for the past few weeks about moving out together to where I'm going to university, and her going to a community college in the area. By the time I finish my bachelors, she'll be finished with her associates and would be ready to transfer to a university when I graduate. She wants to move out to distance herself from her family whom are a bit toxic to her, and also just feels like it's just the right time in general.

We both very much want to do it, and think we could and would work together great. I know her mom fairly well (dad isn't really in the picture), we talk and have gone out to dinner together (us 3) a few times, however my parents are a whole lot more old fashioned and are a lot less liberal. My dad doesn't know her outside of what my mom's told her, and honestly does not have much interest. My mom is similar in that she doesn't have much interest, but she at least knows her a bit and has talked to her when she's over. For the most part my mom likes her. They both are very old fashioned, although my mom is a lot more liberal than my dad. For example, my mom is uncomfortable with simply her being in my bedroom, and doesn't like her even sitting on my bed, and my dad is even worse in that aspect. They more than likely are against couples living together before marriage since that's simply the world they come from and it doesn't help that my girlfriend doesn't come from the same background as my family.

I plan on moving out in 3 months, so I need to talk to my parents soon, or at least my mom. My mom agrees there's absolutely no way I can afford a place on my own, I'd have to get a roommate. If I lived with my girlfriend, we both are modest people and would easily work in a small studio apartment, and would both work part time and split the cost down the middle. Financially I believe it's a good decision for the most part and possibly even cheaper than a 2-bedroom with a roommate.

I want to talk to my parents about this, and I want to continue to get their support with this decision because their support would make this a lot easier. However I'm very scared of losing their support and my parents getting angry with me. I have no clue how they would react, but I need to talk to them soon. Her mom is okay with the idea and is supportive, I just need to get my parent's support as well.

I have a PERFECT hiding spot for it, and I have decided I will study even more than I usually do and help lots extra with chores to make up for betraying my parents.

When he got home, we went to the movies because I wanted to show him my favorite film at the time, Life of Pi, but he complained about the price and then lectured me about how misguided the plot was.

There are other instances where the wedge between us have grown. We got into a fight about abortion. When he found out I was pro-choice we got into a yelling match and I could feel like he was disgusted and disappointed in me because he has condemned abortion vehemently before. We also disagree on a number of political and social issues, so I try to avoid those topics as well.

22841,Non-Romantic,3e5wal,"As I'm just beginning to plan my wedding, this has really been on my mind a lot lately. I've been thinking about the guest list and who I want to be there, and my uncle has been the source of a lot of mental back and forth, and I'm not sure what to do.

Here’s some background on my uncle. He constantly needs to be the center of attention. He’s late middle aged but his everyday attire consists of denim short-shorts with a women’s belt and a tight pink Hooters (or similar) t-shirt. He grows out his hair and seems to simultaneously delight in being mistaken for a woman and bring up inappropriate threats when it happens (eg, when my mom was out to lunch with him and the waiter referred to him as “Ma’am,” he waited until the waiter was gone before saying “If he calls me ‘ma’am’ again I’m going to drop my pants”). 

To be clear, I do not think he is a closeted trans mtf (although I do think he may be privately a cross-dresser), but I would have no problem with that if what he wore were purely an identity issue. Rather, he seems to wear what he does for the same reason he talks about and does what he does: because he seems to always need to have everyone’s attention firmly on him, and appears palpably uncomfortable when that’s not the case. For instance, he just started doing ballet a few years ago, and while I firmly subscribe to the “whatever floats your boat” tribe, he likes to pull it out at very inappropriate times for attention, like the *middle of the hospital waiting room* when my grandmother was sick two years ago and the rest of the family—my mom included—was gathered in the waiting room hoping for word of her condition. He loves Klezmer music, and again—whatever floats your boat—but he will literally interrupt other people’s unrelated conversations to show them YouTube videos of Klezmer bands. 

He is also a master of what my parents call “incorrect kindness.” For instance, as a consequence of enabling his wife and son’s profligate spending habits, he is in **extreme** debt. Worse, my very-much-loved grandmother Bubby (this uncle and my mother's mother) died recently, and for years I, my parents, and much of the rest of the family were worried my uncle would invite my aunt (his sister) to the funeral despite Bubby’s wishes. 

My aunt cut off contact with my grandparents many years ago despite their many attempts to reach out, and my Bubby said in no uncertain terms that she didn’t want my aunt at her funeral because she was very hurt by the way my aunt behaved at Grandpa’s funeral years before. (After not having spoken to him in years, my aunt showed up, threw a very loud tantrum, and then made snide remarks about the family within their earshot—specifically, that she didn’t like being around poor people and wanted to leave to get back to “her people.”) 

Well, my uncle *did* invite said aunt to the funeral, but she didn’t show up. Instead she wrote an extremely disparaging letter completely denigrating my Bubby’s character and blaming her entirely for all of my aunt’s problems in life--**which my uncle then, knowing the contents of the letter, gave to the rabbi to read aloud to the entire congregation at the funeral**. Needless to say, it was extremely hurtful to everyone there as well as the family that couldn’t come but later heard about the incident (myself included).

Lastly, he really, really does not take criticism well. He calls my mother routinely to complain about his wife and son and finances, but refuses to take any advice and even gets angry and lashes out when it’s offered. When my mother (gently) expressed that she was upset at how he gave the rabbi my aunt’s letter at Bubby’s funeral, the response was similarly angry and unwilling to listen.

All of that aside, he has never been cruel to me. He makes a point of trying to take me out to lunch when I’m in town, and always insists on paying when he does. He makes an effort to keep tabs on me and to see how I’m doing, and he’s always been pretty supportive throughout my life.

He is not a cruel man, only routinely inappropriate, attention-seeking, and unwilling to take criticism on any matter. I am worried that if I invite him, he will either wear, say, or do something outrageously inappropriate due to his constant need for attention, and that approaching him about it beforehand will accomplish little (and may even make things worse). On the other hand, I still love him despite all his strangenesses and don’t want to unduly hurt his feelings by failing to invite him.

22872,Non-Romantic,1qxbr7,"**Background:** My family is the typical middle class family- Dad works, SAHM, three kids of which I'm the oldest. Our upbringing resulted in some daddy issues, where my sister and I both ended up dating older men. I grew out of it pretty fast, but my sister dated a 40+M for three years (started when she was 16). He introduced her to pot, and she's been smoking daily pretty much ever since. While some people can be functional pot heads, this guy absolutely was not. He lived in his mother's garage, did not work, and was so fat he had to sleep with an oxygen mask. He manipulated my sister on so many levels, she gave him so much love and time and (my parents') money. My parents stood silent on the sidelines, scared to say anything that might push her away. When I told her she should break up with him, she didn't speak to me for two years. She finally broke up with him, but still maintains the pot habit and lifestyle of being a moocher.

**Now:** She's dating someone new [30+M], who is an upgrade, but still very similar lifestyle to the last guy. 30+M wants to be a rapper, so my sister jumps at the chance to be his promoter, etc. She basically lives to be his assistant, but doesn't have any passions of her own.

I invited her to visit me for my bday weekend. She claimed not to have any money, despite my mother continuing to pay her a monthly stipend while she attends school. My mother agreed to lend her a gas credit card for the visit, and I agreed to pay for her food. She stalled her departure for a full 24 hours, got lost multiple times even with GPS, didn't show up until 8pm on Saturday. She barely socialized at my bday party, even though my friends kept trying to interact with her.

I paid for her food, let her stay at my apt, supplied our adult beverages, yet the only person she showed any friendliness towards is the one stoner in our group. Before she left last night, she asked my stoner friend to sell her $20 of pot. She used my mom's gas credit card to buy rolling papers. She rifles through my things like she's shopping.

The gas card company called my mom to ask if her gas card was stolen, so my mom called my sister. My sister assured her that the card was in her possession, and lied about her purchases.

22873,Non-Romantic,2fqioy,"I guess I'll just start with telling a bit about my childhood friend. Me and my friend met while we were around 8 years old. As we were both bullied, we found a friend in each other. As a child, our relationship was all fun and games, but as she got older she got emotionally draining. She started to get a lot of suicidal thoughts, and she started to seek abusive relationships. The worst thing is that she started to see and hear people (and sometimes things) nobody else could see/hear, and she was convinced that those things were evil and out there to get her. She asked for mental help several times, but no doctor ever took her seriously. Instead, she started to rely on me to keep her sane. She demanded several hours of talk at least four times a week. And the topics she needed help for were too heavy for anyone without psychiatric training, leave alone a teenage years. And if I hurt/rejected her, she only got worse. After some years, I started to see how this affected me, there were no positive parts of our relationship any more (we shared no interests any more) and choose for myself and started to distance myself from her. 

When she was 17 or 18 years old, her condition got worse. She got in a psychosis where she had no control over her thoughts and actions, and she jumped off the roof of the hospital. She survived this, and has been living in mental hospitals/clinics since then and still lives in a mental health clinic. During this time, our contact completely disappeared. Even though I felt bad for her, I was honestly relieved that we didn't have contact any more and the doctors agreed that this was not a good idea. 

Anyways, a few days ago she sent me this message asking me whether I remembered her, and asking me to get back in touch with her. She stated in which clinic she lives now in. I don't know whether her doctors think this is a good idea or whether she slipped through the system somehow, but I don't want contact with her. She might be medicated and under supervision of trained people, but I don't want her in my life. I am afraid that she will rely on me too much again, and ask too much from me. Her problems and behaviour were too much for me, and I am afraid that things will be too similar. I feel kind of guilty for this, as we used to be friends and she sounded desperate for my contact. But I really don't want any contact with her, and having contact out of pity is not my thing either. Now I don't know how I should deal with this. I want to avoid contact with her, without making her problems worse. It was easier when the doctors didn't want us to meet.

22878,Non-Romantic,2ei0i6,"Some life backstory:

This has been the hardest year of my life. This year, my grandmother, 3 great uncles, and 2 friends of the family died since January. My girlfriend received a life saving transplant in January in a city 2 hours away.  However, due to various complications from an infection, her stay has grown to 7 months and her long term outlook remains uncertain. (last 4 weeks in the ICU and counting) She has had kidney failure and will likely need to continue dialysis for the rest of her life, even if she comes home. 

I have a good 40 hr a week job that lets me work from home 90% of the time. I also have a small side real estate business I am trying to start up. I have been driving to the city my GF is in every Sunday night, working remotely Monday thru Friday, and spending each evening with her. I drive home Friday night. I spend 2 days in my home town, working on renovating my 2nd property (100% done by hand by me and my partner), doing laundry, attending funerals, and cleaning our house which contains her cat (I am allergic so my weekends are always stuffy and runny).

---

Financial background:

I have a good job that lest me work remote 90% of the time. I make about 75k a year, but I also have 140k in student loans that take up 40% of my monthly income. I still live comfortably, and have enough money to help my parents pay some bills, and to invest about 1k a month in my side business. However, since my GF's transplant, I have to pay 300 a month for a sublet (likely to increase soon), a full tank of gas to drive each week, turnpike tolls for two states, and extra food costs because I can't cook as much while spending so much time with my GF in the hospital. I am currently not investing in my 401k or contributing to my savings each month because I need the cash on hand. I have only 5k in my bank account for emergencies.

---


The issue at hand:

So on top of all this, I have the issue with my cousin. My first property (not with my business partner btw) I bought for 10k 2 years ago and was going to flip. However, my cousin's [25 F] husband [30 M] suggested that he buy it from me for 30k. We agreed to a land contract. Basically I act as the bank: he owes me 30k, pays me like a loan at 3% interest $480 a month, but he does 100% of the property maintainence. After the last payment the deed goes into his name and he owns the properly. 

Well, who would have thought that they would have trouble coming up with the cash? It started at the beginning: they were unable to even pay the full 3k down payment, only giving me half. They have missed 7 of 21 payments they were supposed to give me, and nothing this year since May. I have been leniant mostly because he said he is going to get a bank loan for $60k and pay me my whole lump sum, but they have been trying and rejected since March over and over. Various exuses for missed payments: I had a surprise $600 phone bill I need to pay an old phone bill to get that bank loan I had to buy firewood because the electric heat was too much etc. My mother stopped by to say hi recently and saw that they had a new stove and new dishwasher, and he just recently bought my cousin a new used car. IF YOU CAN AFFORD THAT SHIT WHY DON'T YOU PAY ME. I DON'T EVEN HAVE A FUCKING DISHWASHER IN MY HOUSE.

I am sick of them taking me for a ride. I am short on the cash. Also I found out today my parents will likely be losing their house in a few months. I want to evict them before my parents need a place to stay and let them stay there. 

Here's the problem: my Aunt just died on Saturday (her mother!) and they have a 5 year old son starting school shortly. Does it make me terrible to ask them to move out and foreclose if they refuse? I am just so stressed and fed up with life in general and their bullshit that I am not thinking clearly.

We both wanted to get out on our own but couldn't afford to live alone, hence the idea we get a place. He makes a lot more than I do, so he pays a little more than me in rent, but we split everything else equally (he also has the slightly larger room). 

He is going out of town soon so he asks me to watch his dogs while he is gone. I do this a lot for him(a lot to me). I used to do it when he would go out of town and was living at his dad's. It's been about once a month every month this year. A couple months ago, I told him, I don't mind watching your dogs while you're gone, but I don't want to do it every month. He is aware that I don't like dogs, or pets for that matter, and his dogs are no exception.

So this time he asks me to watch them for next week. I told him, I'd really rather not this month, can you have someone else do it? He says he'll see what he can do. He then comes to me a few days later and asks again if I could watch his dogs cuz he doesn't want to board them and I again reply that I don't want to this month. So he comes to me last night and says he is cutting his trip short so he won't be gone so long so maybe now I'd be willing to watch them. 

At this point, I'm pretty pissed because he keeps pushing it and tell him no, I'm not watching your dogs, you have other friends you can ask and it's really disruptive to my day to have to go there three times a day to take care of these dogs. I am aware I live there, but I don't spend a lot of time there. He gets pissed and says Really?! You really can't watch them for just a few days?? I do so much for you!! After that I slammed the door and left.  

After I've gone he starts texting saying he realizes now that we aren't friends and he's pissed about the fact that I never contribute anything to the apartment like paper goods, food, cleaners; he's pissed that I never unload the dishwasher or take out the trash or clean anything. He would have a valid point about this, I feel, if I was ever there; using paper towels and eating food and making dirty dishes and trash. But I usually come home just to change and grab a few quick things from my room. I'm not eating his food, I'm not dirtying his dishes.

He also thinks I owe him favors because when I'm super broke, he will want to go out and I'll say something to the effect of, I have no money, why don't we do something here or go somewhere cheaper that I can afford. He will usually say he's got it covered and not to worry about it. But apparently I did need to worry about it.

I think he is getting way too mad me not wanting to take care of his dogs so much, I don't feel like I should owe him anything for hanging out when he pays, and I don't think I'm being unreasonable. He thinks I'm a fake friend and I am unwilling to do the tiniest thing for him. I don't know what to do. I don't think this is fair and he thinks I'm a lazy bitch.

However, all thoroughout our friendship she's always been slighty more depressed, dramatic and self-destructive.

22902,Non-Romantic,381qmp,"My sister's been on shaky ground for sometime lately... at least since she vacationed in the Cayman Islands. When she told us about this relationship, we really wondered about it and then something caught our attention... this guy, by the name of Travis [Late 30's M], had moved their with his wife.

I'm not completely sure of the details about him... just that my sister met him in Madison about 10 years ago out of high school. My uncle and his ex-wife introduced my sister to him, but when it became clear that she was taking an interest in him, they tried pushing her away because of a 'rap sheet' that he had- something that seems to be completely missing from CCAP. Nothing ever took hold, but I know she kept contact with him and she may have been keeping contact with him since then... 

So back to the present time, my sister isn't doing all that well... but to make matters worse, Travis' wife some how got ahold of our mother and sent her some emails. She sent copies of emails that my sister supposedly sent to Travis... but here's the interesting thing... many of those emails were forwarded from his account to her account and then sent to my mom's account... and based on the header and sender info, there are messages that are clearly missing in between responses. Furthermore, some of the emails she's citing are coming straight from her own email which suggests to me that there is some manipulation on her part- but at the same time, my sister is refusing to be honest about her part in it. So I did some digging.

I found my sister's blog and twitter account and it shed some more light on some things. Based on the information I found, May 13th seems to be when things got messy- in the middle of her trip. Yet, Travis' wife claims that they were out of the country... To make things even more interesting, the wife claims they were in contact with the FBI and that they pulled strings to make sure my sister cannot come back to the island. Yet, the thing is, is that last time I checked UK law, it was the same as the US where simply asking someone to be kept out wasn't enough unless potential harm could be proven... Also, this woman claims that if my sister visits any of her family's shops in Beloit, like her brothers spice store, or any of the family's businesses in Janesville, she'll stick the cops on them... and from the way it was written, it seemed like she would try to do more. 

Another thing too that caused Travis' wife to freak out was an apartment my sister got in Janesville- an apartment she no longer has. My sister got this apartment because she's a live in caregiver and it gave her a space away from her work... but Travis' wife refused to accept this reason and again, did not realize that this apartment has been out of the picture for several months. 

What's also interesting is another set of claims Travis' wife made- she claims my sister hacked into my mom's email and sent her emails from our mom's perspective saying that my sister had killed herself over this guy. However, when we investigated the email account, there was no evidence. The only other possibility would be that she, my sister, made a fake email under our mom's name. Furthermore, Travis' wife claims that my sister hacked their emails and facebooks and went after their friends, but no evidence for this was given... and finally, she claimed that my sister made a fake account under her identity and went after her friends with it... but again, no evidence.

Come tomorrow, I'm hitting up the uncle that introduced my sister to Travis... I'm hoping he can shed more light on the issue and pay her a visit to make sure everything is alright. From what I understand, they may have played in a few local bands together... blues bands that played in the bars of Janesville and Madison... and from what I understand, the band Travis was originally apart of is now in Chicago. Also, from what I can tell, my ex-aunt cut all ties off with Travis and from things my sister mentioned in the past, a lot of people did for one reason or another... so with that said, what should I do? Also, is there anyone from Janesville or Madison who has some idea of what was going on with this issue- including information from 2005 - 2007. 

Also, would it be a good idea for someone to email Travis directly to see what's going on?

The fighting, blame-games, he-said-she-said scream matches were the most horrible things I've ever seen.

My grandfather had been suffering from dementia ever since I was a little girl. He had a stroke when I was little and ever since then he's been steadily declining over the years. This, coupled with the fact that mother was the closest family member geographically to my grandparents, meant that we were always the one to help out, bring food, find specialists, translate for my grandmother etc. The past few years he declined dramatically, leading to more arguments between my mother and grandmother about proper care and spending more money for better nurses, a possible care home move, and specialists. My grandmother [65F] rejected all of the options given. 

Whenever we visited my grandfather, either when he was in the hospital in his final days or when we visit his grave, my mother would go through the same cycle of behavior everytime.

She'd start with silence, cleaning up the grave, putting flowers, sitting next to the memorial plaque. The silence would last 10-15 minutes and then I'd see her purse her lips, as if she was holding back her tears. After another 5-10 minutes, we'd leave. All of this done in silence.

On the drive back home, she'd start telling me about how I need to treat her and my father better and how I need to tell my younger siblings to correct their own adolescent behavior towards them (which I do CONSTANTLY). She basically says the same things everytime before leading up to what saying she's really thinking.

She blames herself. She blames herself for not doing enough, for not being there, for being too busy with us when we were younger. She blames herself for not bringing him to a doctor DECADES AGO when he was complaining of migraines because they didn't have health insurance. (My grandparents and parents were immigrants and really struggled when they first arrived). She cries that she hates my grandmother and essentially repeats that she blames herself.

I feel so angry whenever this happens. It's not that I hate to see her crying (I do feel uncomfortable because my family is just not....like that), it's that I hate that she blames herself. I repeatedly say that it's not her fault (and yes, even to my ears, I sound angry) and honestly, some of the things I sound callous and insensitive.

I angrily say things like how many times do I have to say this, it isn't your fault and you couldn't have done anything more. I've also said that it's better that he's gone because he was suffering. I feel insensitive and rude but I don't know what else to say.

I had a rough childhood with her. I suppose I would describe it as emotionally abusive; I was diagnosed with PTSD at 14 and treated for it, and a slew of other mental issues, from 14 to 17. To summarize what was wrong with our relationship, she treated me as a friend rather than a child. She confided marital, financial, and familial issues to me before I was even 8 years old. I was allowed to completely control my diet and most of my schedule (many fake sick days, didn't have to attend extracurriculars) and was quite spoilt with toys and attention. It is important to note my little brother got none of this preferential treatment... Just me. 

Now, I've always wanted to be a mother, so even though I'm young and this was unplanned, I'm doing my damndest to prepare to be a good or even great mother. I've made some mistakes already, most notably quitting my part-time job for reasons I won't get into here. My mother (and father, for what it's worth) have decided to support/help my boyfriend and I in any way possible. 

Or, that's what she says. The reality has been less than supportive. She second-guesses many of my choices, such as not wanting to move in with her (toxic environment) and rehoming my (well loved but very violent/crazy) cat. She keeps mentioning adopting my baby. Over and over again, different reasons every time. I'm crying because my BF wants me to work full time, pump, and hand my weeks-old infant off to daycare providers? Better let her adopt it instead! I'm panicking about quitting smoking cannabis? Better point out CPS could put me in jail until I give birth, then take the baby away and give it to her! It's just insane. 

I do want her in our life. She can be very sweet and caring, and, well, she's my mom. 

I need to figure out what boundaries to set and how to explain them to her. The first day she knew I was pregnant, I told her I would not tolerate negative comments after she went on a rant about how broke I'm going to be. There are ways to talk about my impending financial doomsday without being gloomy (such as asking me what ideas I've come up with for saving/earning money), but she seems quite set on just telling me what can (and according to her, inevitably will) go wrong. When I confront her, she oddly states that she thinks [I] will be a great mom and that she's not worried at all.

We hooked up once before he headed off to college in a city several hours away and again a few months later when he came back to visit his family. The second time he was rather rude the next day, telling me that obviously he wasn't interested in me and I was silly to assume so. I was very hurt and didn't talk to him for around 5 months.

A few years later, while drunk and when Alex was on a break with his long term girlfriend, we hooked up again. I'm not going into details here due to the fact the situation was so weird that it's identifying... but I've never felt so worthless and ugly as I did that night. Just remembering it still makes me nauseas 3 years later. It was a huge blow to my self esteem (but motivated me to lose a lot of weight, so yay?) Again, we didn't talk for a few months. Alex later awkwardly apologized for the situation. I forgave him, he was very drunk when it all happened and seemed genuinely sorry.

I haven't been interested since because I doubt I could ever have sex with him without feeling sick to my stomach... but I'm more than happy to be his platonic friend. Despite how hurtful he's been in sexual situations, we have a really great time when it's platonic. He's one of my favorite people and despite this making him out to be a bad person, I love spending time with him. We have the same sense of humor, same interests and are both laid back people. He's helped me through some hard times, come to comfort me in the middle of the night when I've called him in tears and stayed up for hours chatting with me about life. We often call each other just to catch up and chat for hours, bring each other gifts and make sure the other one is doing okay. 

This spring (again drunk) we were at an event with friends. Alex had his arm around me the whole time, which I didn't find weird at the time since he's a touchy feely person occasionally. That progressed to hand holding, which again I didn't question. (I'm still oblivious). Then out of nowhere in the middle of the event he grabbed my face and kissed me. We ended up making out for a lot of that night. I felt very odd about it the next day. Again, we didn't talk for a bit of time after that.

Every time we are together, he constantly talks about how attractive he finds other ladies/wants to hook up with them. I mean a *weird* amount. It is uncharacteristic and he never talks about this around anyone else. It's almost as if he's trying to make a point. I'm always encouraging that he pursue them because I want him to be happy and honestly, if he's trying to make a point that he's not interested in me... I'm not offended. I'm not interested either. 

He really finds a friend of mine to be gorgeous, Grace. Grace also has feelings for Alex so I've suggested that they get together. I often ask him if he wants to me to invite her to things, but he always says no. This happened at the event too. I offered to invite her along after, he said no he wasn't interested in hooking up with anyone and then... *makes out with my face out of the blue?*

Alex was in town a few weeks ago. He spent almost all of his time with me, most of it just the two of us. It was fun and great to see him! But... odd. He told me about a girl he started dating but spent 20ish minutes explaining how it wasn't *really serious at all* and almost no time telling me about her, even though I asked about her. He also kept incessantly telling me about friends of mine he found attractive or friends of his that he had a crush on. Simultaneously, he would scoot closer to me until we were touching a lot while watching movies, lay his head on my shoulders during group gatherings, generally get cuddly with me. I was pretty awkward and confused during all of this. He also brought up this spring a few times but I would immediately change the subject since I don't want to talk about it. 

I don't know what's going on. I don't know if he has feelings for me that I need to kindly shut down, I don't know what is up with him talking about women he finds hot *constantly* but I know that all this makes me anxious, confused and uneasy. Please help me figure out what is going on here. Given how uncharacteristically mean he's been in some sexual situations (he's otherwise one of the sweetest and kindest people I've met in my life), I'm not especially keen to open up a dialogue on this unless I have to.

22963,Non-Romantic,2ytynd,"I’ve been a lurker for about 1 year, and have been reading threads about other people’s life problems. I figured; why not ask for advice/help so here I am. 

TL;DR My brother tried to suicide, caught up smoking, became a major douchebag to everyone in the family, is lazy and uses my parents. He refuses to listen to anything my parents say and my parents refuse to listen to anything I have to say. My sister uses my parents and lies about being in school when she actually got kicked out.

For this purpose I’ll use different names:  
Father – David (54)  
Mother – Ada (57)  
Brother – Carlos (23)  
Sister – Jen (25)  
Me – I/me (21)  
All this began 2009 during the end of my 9th grade year. My brother, Carlos, tried to commit suicide by taking an excessive amount of pills. He posted it on yahoo answer a few minutes later asking what would happen. A few hours later my parents took him to the hospital because he was feeling sick (at this point they didn’t know what was going on). He gets treated, they pump his stomach and he survives and this is when hell breaks loose. 
My parents begin giving him all the attention, and pushing my sister and I aside. My brother picks up smoking weed and becomes an agro person overall. He’s mentioned how much he’s wanted to kill my mother, constantly yells and breaks shit all over the house, and my parents let him do whatever he wants. He’s totaled 2 cars drunk driving and has a shit ton of weed in the back storage room. My dad has told him not to bring any of his drugs into the house yet he doesn’t do anything about it. He simply just tells him and that’s it. Big bags of weed are sitting in the back yard, because my dad doesn’t do shit about it even when I tell him to. He’s struck my dad once in which I called the cops and they came to take him but my stupid mom begged them not to take her baby. She talks so much shit about him behind his back yet when he’s here she treats him like an angel. 
Example: Brother is showering “MOM GIVE ME MY FUCKING HEATER FUCK. MOM MOM MOM.”
Mom comes up: “Ok, here it is, where do you want to son, on the toilet, on the ground, here?” with a voice like she’s babying him.
WHY THE FUCK DOES SHE DO THAT??? 
There are times where he’ll come home from a party or something and is just yelling and shoving and throwing shit around. It makes me fucking sick. There has been countless time where he’s said he’s wanted to kill my mom. 
He’s also stabbed my cousin a few times but nothing happened to him.
I’ve repeatedly told them to kick him out and they refuse to. I hate my brother, a lot. He stresses me out and fucking makes my life shitty along with my parents.
At this point I’m fed up with my brother and my parents because   
1)	They let him do whatever he wants. (Telling him means nothing if they don’t have any action to stop him)  
2)	They don’t realize how sick and stressed I am over this that I throw up in the night sometimes. I get so fed up with it that I let out a lot of anger because of it (break shit just thinking of it).   
3)	He does whatever he wants, and has already proven that he doesn’t want to get better (his own words)  
4)	He doesn’t pay rent of any bills and just uses my parents.  
Another thing that stresses me out is the fact that my sister also uses both my parents. She doesn’t do anything around the house and doesn’t go to school. My dad thinks she’s in school because she lies about it which is why they don’t charge her rent. She’s 25 and got kicked out of college at 22 and just works. She’s a full on bitch, is spoiled, and is sassy with my parents to an extent that drives me nuts. 

I’m 21; I work a full time job and go to school. I pay my own phone bill, and the house internet. I also give my dad money occasionally to help with house payments. I still live with them. I have a girlfriend whom I’m in love with and have been with her for a long time. We’re both ready financially and want to move in/start a small family. I don’t want to introduce the baby to my family or vice versa unless my brother is out of the house and out of their lives completely. At this point I’m starting to feel a lot of anger towards my parents because they don’t see how much I have to put up with. It’s been years, and nothing is changing. 

Do they need an ultimatum or should I just get the fuck out without telling them.
Reddit what the heck do I do? About both situations! I can’t even write this properly because it makes me so damn angry.

We've had problems in the past (we've lived together 3 years) and I have confronted her about them a number of times with practically zero success. Last year, I came home for my lunch break to find a shirtless male stranger in my bed. I totally freaked out because I didn't even realize she was in the room. When she came out, she said they were only cuddling, but she is a notorious liar/manipulator and I don't believe that at all. Yesterday I found a cup that was not mine on my nightstand, today the window next to my bed was open. I can't prove anything based on this, but I'm fairly certain she's either sleeping or having sex in my bed while she knows I won't be home. 

What can I do about this? I don't have definitive proof, but based on the past and her general selfishness, I am almost certain this is happening. My boyfriend(m20) is suggesting I set up a camera (viewing only my side of the room), but I feel this may be a bit extreme (and potentially illegal?).

22975,Non-Romantic,22d0o8,"Okay first off I turn 18 in 2 weeks. I'm the oldest child, and I have little to no freedom. 

Let's start off with driving. I was supposed to get my license 2 years ago, like everybody else. I was ready to start driving a long time ago, since my grandparents and aunts and uncles started teaching me how at 15, and they regularly let me drive and teach me when I visit them because they know my mom doesnt let me. It's illegal, but I've never been pulled over. I'm a great driver. My mom won't let me drive at all, she won't let me practice so I can pass my drivers test I'm supposed to be taking in 2 weeks. I'm moving out this summer for college and il need to know how to drive since il be alone in a new town, my grandparents are trying to help me get a car. I've tried talking to her so much about her needing to let me grow up and start driving, like everybody else who grows up. She says she can't do it, she gets extremely mad at me everytime I bring it up or even ask if I can drive her to the grocery store and back. I don't know how I'm going to get my license, because I know she's most likely not going to take me to the DMV as well, I'll end up doing it on my own, and then it's going to be ww3 when she finds out I went behind her back to do it. 

Now with leaving the house. Every time I try to go see my friends or bf she acts like I'm asking to move out for good. She gets annoyed with me, gets mad, and says I don't know if you should and tries to talk me out of it.  She tries to get me to stay in and watch a movie even though I've already seen it and she's going to get black out drunk. I hate it when she drinks, I hate being around her when she drinks. She gives me an additude when I get ready to leave and if I need a ride from her, she complains and makes me feel bad. I try to say thank you but she just ignores me. 

Now while I'm out, she texts me a bunch. What are you doing? Where are you? are expected since I'm supposed to tell her EXACTLY where I am, but she also says You've been gone a while. How about you come home? I made a good dinner, come have some (when I eat out) and tries to talk me into coming home before my set time. It drives me insane, my friends obviously get annoyed too because I have to sit there and text my mother half the time. 

She refuses to give me a real curfew, she'll say be home in 3 hours. Or something. Its beyond embarassing since everybody I know can stay out til midnight to 1 AM. They have to cancel the rest of their plans to drive me home. It's really inconvenient for them and makes them hardly want to hang out with me. Then when I do get home, I get the nasty cold shoulder. She doesn't want to hear about what I do, will hardly talk to me, and acts like I insulted her. Sometimes it will last til the next day even. 

Last night when my BF dropped me off, she walked out the house and immediately started bitching at me because I ignored her call when I was literally right in front of the house. I was pulling into the drive way, and wasn't nice to me all night, she was drinking so I just locked myself in my room. 

For lunch at school we can leave campus. I get reduced lunch at school, but the good is disgusting and everybody I know leaves campus, if I was stuck eating at school I would be all alone for the entire hour. My mom tries to give me as little money as possible to stop me from leaving school, even though she can afford to give me a decent amount. So I either not eat or my friends pitch in for me. That's embarassing too. She also complains and disapproves of anyone driving me home from school. She acts like we pulled over and had sex on our way. 

I've always been a good kid, I never went out and got drunk or smoked weed, had sex with a million boys, or even gone to parties. I haven't done anything to lose her trust, but there's no trust anyways. My dad doesn't care what I do, he would let me stay out til 12 as long as I'm good and safe. He knows I won't do anything bad, but what my mom says goes, and he backs her up even though he doesn't agree. I want freedom without feeling horrible about myself for leaving my house. It's messing with me self esteem because of how little trust she gives me. I'm almost 18, a legal adult, I shouldn't have to beg for my freedom. I'm tired of this, and I want a real curfew where I can go do what I want without her acting like she does. 

Can anybody help me?

My sister, Madison, has been dating her boyfriend Dan [30/M] for about 3 years. He seems like a great guy. I only see him whenever he comes to big family events, but I get on well with him and so does our entire family. My parents are pretty sure him and my sister are going to get married one day.

Me and my sister meet up regularly for coffee as we've always been really close. About three months ago I began to notice bruises on her arms. Like lots of bruises all the way up from her shoulder to her elbow. I thought it was strange but didn't question it until a couple of weeks later. When I pointed it out to her, she went as white as a ghost and just tried to brush the question off. I definitely thought it was weird now and wondered if something was going on.

When we next met up for coffee, I noticed finger marks on her wrist and arm and asked her if Dan was treating her right. She insisted he was and went on the defensive, getting upset I was accusing her boyfriend of hurting her. I apologised, moved on, but when she got  cuts on her cheeks and arms, I knew something was afoot. I arranged to meet her for a coffee as usual and confronted her as soon as we'd sat down. She then admitted that he'd hit her. She told me it was fine, he promised he wouldn't do it again and she believed him. I mentioned that the bruises had been prominent and regular for months now and she told me that maybe it was an occasional thing.

I told her to tell me if he ever did it again. Two nights ago she came over to give back some video games Dan had borrowed and I noticed a bad bruise near her eye. She told me to back off when I started to question her but before I knew it she broke down in tears. She eventually told me the whole story, about how he'd been emotionally abusive, calling her worthless, fat and ugly for the past year or so and in November last year he started hitting her. 

She says she doesn't know what caused this. She said he used to be a kind and loving man, back when she began to date him, but has since turned into a bully. She says it was a gradual change, little jokes started turning into over the top taunts and it just grew into this abusive relationship. 

She's genuinely terrified of him, but says she can't leave him under any circumstances. She still loves him and thinks he'll change. Sometimes he can be the sweetest guy on the planet, then two minutes later he'll hit her. It breaks my heart to see my sister like this. I asked if I could tell my parents but she was absolutely against it. She says she'll try and sort it out and that if I told Mom or Dad she'd never speak to me again. She made me swear I wouldn't breathe a word to anyone.

I want to tell my parents, but I don't know if they'll believe me, especially if Madison covers for Dan. 

I have no idea what to do.

22992,Non-Romantic,1yvf16,"So I'm in a bit of a predicament with one of my best friends who I have a little bit of a crush on.. Don't worry it's not another friend zone post for the most part.

 Some background on us is we met at the beginning of last semester through an extra curricular, I'm a sophomore she's a freshman.  Even though we were acquaintances we never really talked until around November when we kind of just clicked. We would talk/text all the time, something we still do now.  We would hang out but usually in groups... That changed this semester where we started hanging out just the two of us, I found out recently that neither of us were really sure if these were dates or not so we kinda just went with it.  Since I was afraid to ruin the friendship I never made any romantic move (something I regret), however We both still consider each other one of our best friends we know at school. 

This is where my problem arises,  this past weekend I got little drunk at a party and ended up texting her about how I wish she was there.. Nothing too strange, she said we should hang out this weekend so I offered up plans for lunch, she said she hopefully be able to..  The next day comes around and I text her apologizing for drunk texting her but I still would be up to hang out since I hadn't seen her in a while. She replied a few hours later saying she had been busy with school work, we text for an hour or two and it's around dinner time now so I ask if she wanted to grab dinner, something, I did not really consider a date at the time.  she asks if we should invite any other friends and I say I am fine with just us if that was okay with her.  At this time she asks straight up if this is a date and that maybe we should just go out for lunch tomorrow so she had more time to get ready.  Which caught me severely off guard. I ask her if that would be at all weird and that we should try talking about it in person. She said she rather talk about it now and that talking in person would give her a lot more anxiety.  I told her I would be interested in dating her if she was open to it.  She told me she was in a weird situation with an ex[M21] currently, where they've been hanging out as she put it not really doing anything but he got her some jewelry and she was just a little confused, and she wasn't sure if I wanted to get in the middle of that or not, it sounded like she wasn't completely shutting out the idea.  She also had some concerns about things becoming weird between us but also said there was no reason for the friend zone talk.  We ended up not getting lunch Sunday which gave me some more time to think it over.

I don't even know where I stand with her anymore, we talked a little more about what was said but our conversation eventually switched back over to normal topics and it hasn't come back up in the past 2 days and it seems like nothing has changed from before.  I know I need to talk to her in person and we already have plans to go to a concert this Sunday that are still on.  I do still want to ask her out, I am not sure to wait a few weeks to see what happens between her and her ex or bring it up next time I see her. What do you guys think?

23010,Non-Romantic,2y9wvp,"Last August my friend, Alice, had a bit of a mental breakdown. In the months leading up to it she had been dealing with depression. We, myself  and another friend (Helen), did what we could to help her but we realized she needed professional help and encouraged that she get it. Alice had been living with her friend Arnold (M22). (side note: Alice, Helen and myself have been friends for about 4-5 years. Arnold and Alice have been friends for longer...not sure how much though) 

Arnold was a total sweetheart and they seemed well suited to live with each other. It was a strictly platonic relationship as he is gay. For the last year Alice had expressed her growing interest in moving to the big city where myself and Helen are. Alice wanted Arnold to move with her and he was somewhat interested but not totally sold on it. 

This really bothered Alice, she felt like he wasn't being 100% honest with her and she started putting a lot of pressure on him. Helen and I told Alice that she should just move on without him and come on up here. She would have been able to stay with Helen until she found an apartment and a new job. For some reason though Alice was dead set on Arnold coming with her and she kept pressuring and pressuring him. They had a few spats and she grew increasingly angry and resentful towards him. 

Finally, Arnold had to come out and tell Alice that he had to move back to his mom’s. He was going to have an immediate surgery on his knees and wouldn’t be able to afford to be roommates anymore. He figured that would be the easiest way to get Alice to lay off since it was a perfectly logical reason. Alice completely lost her mind. She started yelling at him, throwing furniture and whatever else she could get her hands on, and yelling “Do you want me to hurt myself!?!” and other similar statements. He was never touched by her or any of the objects but after she stormed out to drive somewhere he called the police. Helen and I both agree it was the right thing to do. She was in a terrible state and we didn't know if she really would harm herself or not. 

Turns out Alice drove to her parents. The police tracked her down there, arrested her, and booked her for the night. She was released the next morning. Since then the case has been dropped, she is living with her parents, back on medication, in therapy and doing seemingly really well. She and Arnold haven’t had any contact since the incident 

Fast forward to this last week...Arnold contacted Helen and myself. He said that he wanted to come visit us. We didn't have a problem with it since we did like the guy and in our eyes, he didn't do anything wrong. We did tell him that we would have to ask Alice about it because we didn't know how she would feel about it and didn't want to do this behind her back. He understood that. 

Helen explained the situation to Alice and she didn't take it so well. She said that she wasn't okay with us having any contact with him and that it hurt when she saw anything of his on Facebook that we commented on or liked. But she kept her mouth shut and did her best to ignore it. Alice basically shut down and said she couldn't talk about it. Finally a couple of days later she started talking to Helen again. All this time, Helen had been a fucking mess and I was upset too. Arnold ended up hurt as well and he posted some vague post on FB. Of course everyone knew who he was talking about and they proceeded to talk shit about Alice AND Helen. Helen deleted him, she couldn't take it. Ultimately I did the same. I don’t like seeing that stuff and I was never THAT close to him. Many more words were exchanged but that is the gist of it.

Alice doesn't think she did anything wrong. She thought it could all be swept under the rug, like it never happened. Helen and I were still upset and appalled at her behavior. It turns out after all of this she hasn’t taken responsibility for his actions. She blames “one punk bitch”  for her arrest and going to jail. She doesn’t understand why this one “little” mistake has to follow her around and is now freaking out because she thinks she will never get to move to the big city and will be living with her parents until her record is clean. 

Helen and I are having a hard time moving on. Alice behaves this way and then expects us to continue on as normal. We’ve told her this isn’t okay - we’ve dropped friends for doing this in the past (as has Alice!). We’ve tried telling her to just move on and not dwell, one misdemeanor is not the end of her professional career. She’s not having it and not REALLY understanding. We are at a loss and don’t know what to do now. 

Helen and her husband have also decided that they can’t have Alice living with them in the future. They can’t trust that she will behave in a mature manner and they don’t need that kind of stress in their lives since they plan on trying for a baby, etc soon. Helen hasn't told Alice yet as she is afraid of another outburst. She will have to tell her soon though. We feel like everything we say goes in one ear and out the other. At this point we are at a complete loss.

TL;DR: Friend had a mental breakdown, isn’t assuming responsibility for her shit fit and is causing unneeded stress and heartache.

She seemed nice and stable, but when his income started ramping up, he was much more interested in clubbing and being seen than settling down.


In the last few months, he's started dating a girl that, again, none of us have met. She has a kid from a previous relationship, but we don't know any of the story there. We googled her because we didn't know anything about her, and it's something we do with anyone that one of our friends starts dating.  Turns out she's naked all over the internet on porn sites, has used at least two different names before, and has no discernible profession other than potentially getting paid for her internet nudity/porn.

Our friend just bought an awesome place worth nearly $1 Million, and apparently at her direction, they're doing another $250k of renovations to it. Apparently, based on all her Facebook posts that she tags him in, she's also moving in. They've been together for maybe 5 months?

Anyway, the question is - do we talk to our friend about our concerns with her, or let him figure it out on his own? We all care about him a lot, and have seen him grow from the geeky coke-bottle glasses nerdy kid into the successful business owner he is today, and we worry that the girls he seems to attract may not have his best interests at heart. He's not a dumb guy in life, but he's incredibly naiive about women.  What do we do or not do?

23014,Non-Romantic,34sb9a,"So I am the house manager if you will in house of a 5 college girls. We are all juniors or seniors/grad students, so you'd think we'd be mature or reasonable at this point, but then again maybe not. So, as two new tenants are moving in at the end of the summer, I thought it would be a good time to go over what everyone's plan is over the summer so we can figure out all the bills for the house.


Myself, my other roommate will be staying in town and living in the house while the roommate in question will be out of town working at an internship. Our landlord is also a bit of a pain to work with because she really doesn't know how to manage a property. So she offers 10 month and 12 month leases, which can leave an inconsistent amount of tenants in the house. It looks like over the summer it will be just us three on the lease until August rolls around.


Here's where the problem comes in. I suggested that since we live in a co-op energy area where energy, water, sanitation and trash pickup are all under one utility bill, that we would split the bill evenly 3 ways but take out water from the roommate who will not be in the house. Honestly, I even think I'm being generous in taking that out considering she should have found a sub-leaser, but whatever.


She adamantly refused. She claims that when she lived in this house before I moved in, she was home by herself for the summer and had to pay everything by herself. Whoever her roommates were, they were total shit bags for making her do that. But now she is refusing to pay for something she claims she isn't even using. Yes, she is not personally using electricity, but we live in the south and air conditioning is a thing. And just because we close vents in certain rooms doesn't mean our bill will be significantly lower. 


My roommate who will be here with me suggested asking her to pay a flat fee that would cover a decent portion of the utility bill as a compromise, but I guess I'm really stubborn and don't think that she can expect not having to pay for something that she should have taken care of in the first place by getting a sub leaser. 


My question is, is it worth forcing this issue and sticking my ground, or is it something that I should concede for the sake of not losing my mind and her hating me?

23018,Non-Romantic,3dcfw6,"Hi Reddit!  This is my first time posting on Reddit, ever and it sucks that I'm starting out with such a negative post, but I am in such a bad state right now I could really use some advice. 

I've been feeling very empty inside for a long time but this past weekend has really just hit the nail on the coffin.  I am part of a friend group which comprises of approximately 10 girls.  Not all of them are close to each to other, and we don't always all hang out.  I am particularly close with two girls part of the group, Annie and Beth.

This past weekend I went on a short trip with girl Annie.  Basically, both of us wanted to go but I in particular was more keen on going, because I had some friends in the city we were visiting and also was interested in meeting up with a boy who I had just met a month ago and had been talking to.  Annie knew all of this going in -- she even said she was excited to hang out with my friends (most of whom she has met before) and encouraged me to have one-on-one time with this boy.

So we finally go on this trip and Annie becomes a complete princess.  The first day my friend comes to pick us up at the airport, takes us around to places we want to see, makes reservations at restaurants for us, etc... She keeps complaining about how tired she is and wants to take a nap at the hotel, etc etc...  The first day manages to be okay though, and we both fall asleep with no big issues.

On the second day, however, things really turn for the worse.  We both go to a girl's brunch we both planned a LONG time ago and she refuses to talk to ANY of the people there.  Mind you, she was aware of all the people who were coming and even said she was excited about hanging out with all my other friends.  My other friends try to ask Annie questions and include her in all parts of the conversation but she answers either yes or no and stays on her phone most of the time.

After brunch, the boy I had been talking to asked if we wanted to go to a park.  Annie says she is too tired and she just wants to sleep at the hotel again.  I ask her are you sure? do you want to do something else? And she says yes, she just wants to sleep.  So I go this park and come back and she suddenly explodes at me.  She says that this trip was a disaster and that she just wanted to go home.  During this fight she continuously insults me personally, saying that I am selfish and saying how the boy I had been talking to is just using me and how he would never take me seriously.  I am astounded because I thought it was very rude of her to say stuff like that regarding the boy and I, especially since we were still in the getting to know each other stage and we talked about going on this trip WAY before I even met the boy.  I point out to her that she was invited to everything that my friends had planned for US, and not just me.  She admits that she was tired and not at her best state to socialize, but she still claims I had not been attentive to her.  At this point I just say I am sorry because I do feel bad since most of the people we had been hanging out with are closer to me than her, but I also felt like she didn't give the trip a chance by refusing to talk to anyone.  

Annie continuously messages Beth openly complaining about me and how I am such a a bad friend while looking for earlier flights.  I just say I am sorry and offer her options to help her feel better but she keeps rebuffing them.  At this point it is 3 AM and she falls asleep, but I stay up all night stressed and throw up about 5 times throughout the night.   

The next morning I am still feeling ill.  I simply did not have the energy to do anything anymore and I tell her that I am sorry but I need to rest at the hotel.  She storms off.  Eventually we get on the flight back to our home city (during which she continues to complain) and I haven't talked to her since.

What makes me sad even more is that it is obvious that Beth is on Annie's side.  Throughout the trip, I did not speak to anyone about the situation because I felt like it is something between us, but Annie thought it would be a good idea to complain to everyone.  I originally really believed that I was in the wrong but now I see that I am just part of a toxic group of friends and I really want out.  I've been so stressed I have been barely eating, losing 6 pounds in 2 days... As much as they have been stressing me out, these group of girls were my best friends for almost a decade, and it would really suck to lose them all at once... I am just totally unsure of how to move forward with this situation.  Am I completely in the wrong here, as Annie believes?  How can I move forward from this situation with minimal damage as possible?

My parents were married for 28 years when my mom passed away unexpectedly last September. My mom was pretty much my dad's first everything. They met at work when he was 17, married when he was 21. They didn't have the typical go on some dates/courtship thing, it was more like instant relationship. She did everything for him and I wondered how he was going to manage, but he's making do.

My dad is an introvert through and through, and he has that sort of self-deprecating humor or view of himself; he knows he's not Brad Pitt or a fascinating conversationalist. If he's not at home in front of his computer, he's at his one close friend's house hanging out or riding his motorcycle if it's nice outside. He still has my two sisters (24 and 13) living at home.

Since early in the year he's been talking about dating, which to me seems a bit soon but that's not for me to decide I guess. He was talking to a woman he works with for awhile; they and another male coworker would get lunch often, and he would casually bring up going out sometime but she would always giggle and do the oh yeah, maybe thing - at least from what he said, that's my impression. After awhile he kind of got the message that she wasn't all that interested - they still go to lunch but without the talk of going out.

I'm not sure how to best support him in this. A few months ago he asked for my (middle) sister's and my help with setting up an online dating profile and I haven't broached the topic with him since. I want to help him be happy but I'm not sure what to do. Honestly it scares me a little to think of him out on a date knowing it's probably one of the most uncomfortable things for him to do - in the way that I imagine a parent is scared for their child to go to school, maybe. Supporting my friends dating feels totally different than this situation - what can I do?

23036,Non-Romantic,2uoz2l,"So, I go to a 4 year college. It's really small and has only about 2700 students. Last year, I tried to seriously harm myself, and I had to take a year off my school. During that time I went to community college and caught up on credits. This is my first semester back.


I kept in touch with my closest friends while I was away and was happy to see them again and be back. For the first week or two, everything was fine. My closest friend, Alex, introduced me to some of his friends and we all clicked. I thought I had finally found the group of friends I always desired but never really had growing up. We would always hang out, go out to parties, etc.


That is, until this week. I had a rough day last week. I didn't want to get out of bed, I was hungover, and I was dealing with the news that my very recent ex got engaged, and I have to see him around school a lot since we are involved in some of the same activities. I texted my friends asking for help, for them to come see me or get a meal with me. All of them shut me down and said they were busy. Some of them ignored me. I was pretty upset and spent most of the day inside, trying to recover and take care of myself. I asked the same friends if they wanted to go out with me that night and never got an answer. I saw them all out at a party that I went to that night and got seriously annoyed.


The next day I felt better and went about my college life. However, my friends were ignoring me. I asked Alex what was up, and he said he was disappointed in me and didn't want to get involved in my so-called downward spiral. I explained to him that I had a rough day, I apologized for coming off as needy, and that if he needed space to tell me. He never replied. I saw him around later that day and he actively avoided me. It really hurt. The week before he had encouraged me not to deal with tough issues on my own and that I shouldn't be too afraid to admit I need someone else and need someone else's support. So how come when I did that, I got shut out and abandoned?


Last night I noticed he unfriended me. I got even more upset. I've been trying to hold myself together. I've lost most of my core friends so I have very few left. I'm eating my meals alone now and when I'm not at club meetings I'm alone in my apartment with just my roommates, who are always busy. It sucks. I feel alone and have no idea what I did wrong. Yeah, I can be promiscuous and drink quite a bit some nights, but it's college. It's kind of my way of dealing with things right now. In no way are any of my actions indicative of a downward spiral or as drastic and serious as the actions that got me kicked out of school for a year. I've learned better ways of dealing with my illness and have not harmed myself in almost 10 months. I mentioned to Alex a bit how upset I was about my ex and how I had passing thoughts of self-harm, although I did not want to nor did I go through with them. He reported me to the school and I had to go in for counseling, but we still stayed friends. It wasn't until my bad hangover day that he cut me off, and I don't know why. My friends all cut or have been through things like me, and I don't know why they would leave me when I needed someone to be there. I felt like of all people, they should understand what I am going through more than most.

I previously had a boss that was wonderful. He let me do my work and didn't bother me unless I asked him for help. Now, my favorite boss has quit. I now have a new boss that just started with the company less than 3 weeks ago and was just out of training on the 1st.

His answers included the Christian religion repeatedly, which I am ok with. It seemed slightly inappropriate to quote the bible in a work email, but I let it go. Later, he came by my desk to get my questionnaire. He read my answers and laughed at my answer for what event I would like to see which was to see the first woman president. He raised his eyebrow at me and said, you wouldn't vote for Hillary, would you?


My jaw dropped. I just said, well, if she runs, I would probably vote for her. I am a democrat. His eyebrows raised.  He has been ignoring my emails for clarification on a document since then. I feel really weird now and I'm just unsure of what I should do. Should I talk to him about his comments or should I escalate it further if he continues to ignore my need for help?

Growing up lets just say he was a less than attentive father and I came to terms with it fairly quickly in life. My mother and father have been separated since I can remember and both were very young when they had me.

Without going in depth with my entire childhood we'll just say I never felt welcome and always felt like a huge burden in every sense to both of my parents. Living with my father it was especially hard when he chose his new wife and her daughters over me. Parties were attended, family photos were captured and trips to who-knows-where happened without me. Through this I learned independence and self-sufficiency where I kind of just accepted it and figured it wasn't worth my time to yearn for attention. However, Recently we've found a lull in or out bursts and have been really calm. Lately we've been trying to have conversations about whatever nonsense comes up and small talk here and there. For god sakes we teamed up the other day to change all four rotors on my car so that I could be done before nightfall. It's been an interesting last 10 months...

I'm completely able to be on my own and financially stable, but I just haven't decided to up and desert the man yet. Maybe its my ENTJ nature where I cut losses and move on but I can feel that my father and I will not have a strong enough bond after we move on to pretend to be related.

We've been friends for awhile now and we chat frequently and he's just been overall a great guy and a great friend. However, something recently happened and it's been kind of bothering me. I realize I'm probably overreacting, regardless, I feel as though what he did was wrong and I don't know how to make him understand why it was wrong. 


Last week Riley had plans to hang out with a bunch of friends after work. While going out, one of his friends (Creepster), commented on having nude pics on his phone of a girl (Vicky) that Riley was going to be meeting for the first time that night. Apparently, Vicky's ex-bf saved naked pictures she sent him (years ago) and sent it to Creepster, who was Vicky's ex-bf's room mate at the time. Creepster has apparently been carrying around these pictures for years and shows it to various other guys without her knowing. Riley looked at the pictures and later bragged to me several times about it because apparently this girl is really attractive.


I'll admit, I was pretty disgusted at first. I never could have imagined Riley doing something like that. He was always one of those seemingly genuinely good guy types. I guess I was just surprised that not only did he not tell his friend how gross and creepy he was, he chose to partake in the viewing instead of telling him off and/or choosing not to participate. I gave myself about a week to think about it, and I'm still feeling pretty grossed out by it. I just feel really bad for this girl because apparently she met all of these guys who were friends of a friend of hers and they have all seen these naked pics of her and she just has no idea.


Anyway, rather than be upset about it; I thought it would be constructive to talk to Riley about it so that he could understand why it was wrong and hopefully learn from the experience and maybe do the right thing in the future. We frequently discuss a lot of topics at great length and are generally pretty open with each other. But, I  tried discussing it with him and he's just disagreeing with me that he did anything wrong. I'm hoping I can get some alternative perspectives (unless you all think I'm overreacting and am in the wrong, which would be okay too!), so that I can try to make him understand how and why it was wrong. 


***


In a nutshell, he says that he understands all of my points, but that he disagrees. He claims that he did nothing wrong because he didn't share the pictures and it's exactly like viewing pictures of girls on gone wild . According to him, only Vicky's ex bf (for giving away the pics without her knowledge) and Creepster (for sharing them) are in the wrong. But viewers aren't. ???? Apparently, his one regret is telling me in the first place. So, no real progress at this point.


I know for me personally, I would be mortified if someone was passing around saved pictures of me (from years ago, seriously??!). 


What do you all think about this?  How do I convince him that he was in the wrong? Or am I just overreacting?

My brother and I are very close and I have tried to comfort him and we bonded through our mutual dislike of our dad.
Recently, I've noticed that he has a lot of scars on himself and I caught him poking and scraping himself with a nail a few times. I've confided in a close friend because I didn't want to jump to conclusion and make a big deal, but I'm really worried about my brother. I understand his pressure and from a logical point, it is definitely unfair how my dad is treating him. But I also cannot talk to my dad about any of this because he's a person that is prone to violence and verbal abuse and when he drinks (which is all the time, usually at night) he's even scarier by psychologically fucking you up.
If anyone can give me some courage or anything, I don't really know what to do. Thanks.

23140,Non-Romantic,2k2uh0,"My sister and I decided to share an apartment after I finally finished University. We've lived here for two months. We've had a few 'fitting-together' problems in the realms of locking doors, keeping things clean, caring for the animals...where I expect her to and she doesn't. 

She ignored my graduation. She blew of my Birthday (claiming the Banks in Canada were all closed...) and she has this boyfriend who tries to take responsibility for her over things I'm not sure he can. i.e. I told her she didn't clean up all the feces her dog had left by the door. She went to clean it and still left some. When I confronted her the boyfriend assured me that it was his fault because he didn't tell her exactly where to clean. 

My sister is diabetic and she is always sick, misses a great deal of work, and I found out tonight that she hasn't been coming up with the rent money on her own. She's been calling her father. 

Anyway, I have Asperger's and I'm not great at social issues and the conflict between us was starting to bother me. I don't tend to get verbally angry I just deal with what's not getting done and then am more civil than friendly...if that makes sense. But I was very upset when she stuck me with her dog again because she wanted to go hang out with her boyfriend but lied, saying he had a big break down (which I keep hearing) and he 'really, really' needed her. I knew it was a lie and it upset me. It also brought up the other things I was upset about, the things that just frankly hurt my feelings, like blowing off my birthday. 

So I did what my therapists have always told me to do when I have trouble communicating. I wrote a civil letter to her and tried to keep it short and phrased in the 'I feel' format, rather than 'you are' format. I told her that I was hurt and that I felt taken advantage of. I apologized for writing a note rather than speaking to her directly. 

I got several texts from her boyfriend the next day telling me that she was having more panic attacks and that he could not 'get her to promise she wont hurt herself'. I didn't think much of it, since theatrical behavior is quite typical of my sister. 

Then this past evening her boyfriend shows up at our apartment to collect her dog and her things because my sister 'isn't safe' with me. I didn't push an inquiry with him, he was clearly angry with me. 

I messaged my sister to ask what was going on and she informed me that she spent the previous day in the hospital because she tried to commit suicide using her insulin. 

I asked why. 

She said she had unbearable anxiety and dark thoughts. 

I asked why she didn't call me if she was so bad. She always has. 

She said I wasn't good for her anymore. 

I am very upset. I feel upset because my sister tried to kill herself. I also feel upset because while logically I am aware this is not my fault, it feels that way. I feel as if I am now the bad person and that I did something wrong by trying to communicate how I was feeling about some issues we  were having. I don't like being viewed as a villain and objectively I don't feel that I have been. 

I'm conflicted about my feelings on this because I suspect this is some kind of borderline personality type behavior and I will get hurt by it. I feel as if she has violated my trust and that we can never have the decent relationship we had before. I feel like she has taken something that should have been about me and how I was feeling and made it into an enormous catastrophe that not only makes it all about her, but also allows her to punish me for having expressed my needs. 

I have a B.Sc in Neuropsychology but interpersonal behavior is not my forte, not with Asperger's. I don't know what I should consider doing. I don't know how I should feel about her or myself. Have I done something wrong? Did I break social etiquette by telling her how I was feeling? Am I a bad person for feeling angry with her for this?

I became close friends with Alex quickly. I joke that he is my straight gay best friend lol. We are very close. We have slept together in the same bed, we cuddle up and watch movies. When we are sick we have taken care of each other. I was having a really bad period once and he brought me chocolate covered pretzels (my fav) and my favorite movie. He is super sweet. He is an artist and I have posed nude for his paintings before. 


We are also roommates with one other guy.


He is a quiet guy but him and I can talk for hours. I have a good group of friends but no one I am really close to except Alex. He is seriously my best friend.


To make things more awkward...we dated for a bit. We had both gotten out of relationships that ended very badly. Comforting each other we were both like hey we are both single why not date? 


Us together was a nightmare. We dated for less then 3 months and fought nonstop. It was a weird situation. It is kindof like as friends we could cancel plans or be like hey I am busy tonight doing whatever but dating that doesnt seem to fly well lol. Its hard to describe but it caused alot of fights. Sex wasn't bad but it wasn't this amazing passionate thing either. It was like we couldn't fully open up sexually with each other I guess.


So after a nasty fight we decided to save our friendship and break up. It took a few awkward months to get back to being friends. 


We never fight as friends. We joke and tease each other but never fight. I seriously love and adore him and couldn't imagine him not in my life. I'd say he is like a brother but that isn't really it and would be weird since we have had sex. He is just my straight gay best friend lol He is definitely straight.



The problem is that our dates have a hard time understanding this. And I totally get it. I am a jealous person and its hard to see your SO with their opposite gender best friend who is also their ex. 


Alex doesn't usually have serious relationships. He is that brooding artist type and IMO attracts girls who are not long term prospects lol. He has fun whatever. But recently he has started dating this girl and they have been together only a month which is a bit long for him lol but he really likes her. 


I have tried being friendly but she obviously has a problem with me. It doesn't help that he didn't tell her we dated. But at a party a mutual friend brought it up and she was pissed. It has made an uncomfortable situation to say the least. Our group of friends usually all hang out at our place and do game nights every week. She either doesn't want to come which makes Alex feel like he shouldn't come or she comes and shoots me daggers all night.

23157,Non-Romantic,2tq46c,"Just a little context before I get in to the meat of the post (Posted here before about getting over the same relationship but that was on an old account), going to keep it short as well:  
  
Dated this girl for 8 years about 4 years ago, haven't actually talked since the break up. Relationship was ended because of childish bickering, we were both immature at the time. It took me 3 of those 4 years to get over it all while dating other people (about 4-5 relationships in between then and where this thread starts off), none really panned out for other reasons.  
  
Now for the situation at hand:  
  
This same girl has gotten back in touch with me, through her own efforts with no help of mine. I was surprised in the beginning but kind of just let it happen, this was about a week ago, she says she misses our friendship, cool I understand, between the bickering we had a really strong friendship and relationship in general, I missed talking to her as well. The conversation went on to how's your life, stuff about each other and so on, then suddenly nothing for 2 days (the messages back were about 2-3 hours apart, totally acceptable), I ask if I said something wrong and after another day rolls by she responds says No you didn't say anything wrong, just been really busy, sick kid got me sick etc, all good no harm done, but completely ignores the previous message talking about and asking a few questions. Seems like I did say something wrong but she just doesn't want to admit it, fine with me, conversation goes on, she says her kids name, etc, I ask unknowingly oh is that his name, that's a great name she explains her reason for picking the name etc, cool, ask a few more questions (baby daddy stuff etc, not anything offensive just curious asking, nothing like Hey you single want to go out I don't even think I implied anything like that, it was more along the lines of What did he think of the name, how is he doing?), and suddenly she's magically gone again. This is all on Facebook so it shows it as seen, but just... Nothing.  
  
Which brings everything to current, I talked to a friend about it, she says it seems like she misses the friendship but really isn't ready to come back to it/is wishy washy about it (suddenly disappearing etc) as well as not willing to put effort in to the friendship, which I can see. I also see the girls side of it, she's busy has a kid etc, but at the same time, it just seems odd for multiple messages in a day, then nothing for 2-3 days.

My husband got a virus, and so did I. Typical, except it woke up my asthma. Prior to this an inhaler, maybe one nebulizer treatment every 2 years fixed it. No biggie at all as long as I never over exerted myself, and made sure to take care of any colds. When I was a child, my asthma was not under control. I had frequent trips to the ER, my heart stopped under anesthesia, and so forth. In College I had another hospitalization, and they gave me a medicine that messed with my heart. Because of this I have had a nebulizer machine since I was a child, but I have NEVER needed to use this machine since umm 2008... always just used the one at the doctors when needed. 




Well, on Monday I was at urgent care and got a steroid for fix the throat, cold etc issues. Am told to take inhaler as needed. Tuesday I wake up, and I can't breath at all. I take a cab to the urgent care, and get rushed in for nebulizer treatment. At this point I cannot speak, have issues walking, can't feel my fingers well etc etc. The doctors get me my script for my nebulizer, and send me home. Thank god my machine STILL works, so I've been using it every 4-6 hours on top of the steroid. Even so....




I am only now recovering from the virus and able to walk, talk full sentences etc again. I had to go to my university (I'm a housewife and full time student, husband is a full time salaryman) though, so I took my nebulizer before going, packed it up to my bag, and went straight to the clinic when I arrived on campus. The trip was nice because it was all train except for the taxi part which meant calm, AC air which is good for me. I am monitored at the clinic, am told to take the nebulizer ever 4 hours now, and they let me have my own room until my class, and I take my nebulizer again before my class. I get through class and am able to get home. 




---




This is the most I've done all week. My husband has been heating up food, doing the cores, setting alarms for me to take my machine middle of the night etc etc. He has waited on me hand and foot and I could not have gone through that class I could not miss (I would have lost my shot on graduating this spring!), and why I am getting better. He is losing sleep because of this, had to take some time to work from home etc. His company is generous, so the WFH was fine. 




So I think I'm getting better cause today I had a good productive day, albeit I spent most of it in a clinic... and so my husband doesn't wake me up for my nebulizer treatment. I wake up 40 mins past the time, and I'm suffocating/coughing/wheezing/etc. He sets up my machine, and I'm ok. I'm not as great as I was when I was on campus this afternoon, but I can type and I can talk and I can eat and walk around the house. :) 




The thing is, since we thought I was getting better we agreed to spend time with my in-laws. My in-laws know I'm sick, but not how bad. But this weekend is holiday, and we're suppose to spend saturday through sunday there. Their house is NOT a good place for my asthma (dog, dust, no AC (will be in 100s this weekend), no dedicated outlet for the machine which means I'd need to leave my bed to use it... hard to do when can't breath. and so forth) plus it's a long trip to get there. Plus I am 2 blocks from a highly ranked ER that takes our insurance, and they are 10-15 miles via car-only. 




I feel horrid. We are suppose to see them every other weekend at least plus holidays. We missed the last 3 weekends because of my schooling, furniture shopping, and my husband having to heal from the virus he gave me. The Thursday before the first weekend of the three we missed they saw us for dinner, so it wasn't that bad. But missing a holiday plus it being like we haven't seen them for a month looks REALLY BAD. Plus my husband wants to see them, and frankly he should. He shouldn't have to spend his weekend taking care of me. But there is no one else, I have no family in the area or friends who I trust enough to spend the night and are able to actually spend the night. 




So the way things stand now, my husband will leave the house Saturday afternoon and come back Sunday evening. I will be alone overnight, and I have no one to monitor me. I am concerned, and rather he stay here. I also am concerned because my in-laws will be very upset with me.... Again they have never seen me with asthma like this, so they just need to believe me on my word. They don't see me having to bring my nebulizer on a freaking 40 min subway ride to school in case I get an attack. They don't see me waking up suffocating, or shaking so bad from treatment etc. 




So what should I be doing? Should I try to have my husband spend his weekend with me, and just have his parents come over for dinner on Friday (we'd have to order in though b/c I doubt I can take a trip to the resturant)? Should I suck it up and attempt to go there Saturday, knowing I very likely will end up in the ER? Should I just check myself into the hospital for the weekend while my husband is gone? Should I strab a O2 machien to me and jet off to my parent's 3000 miles away?! WHAT SHOULD I DO?! I WANT TO MAKE EVERYONE HAPPY BUT ALL I AM DOING IS MAKING EVERyONE MIsRABLE CAUSE OF STUPId FucKing ASTHMA! Plus how the hell do we even explain it to them?! GAH

So ill start off with giving a little back story. My dad got married to my step-mom back in November. But before that they were already living together. I don't get along with them and a month before they got married i got into a big fight with my dad and haven't really seen them much since then. Just the occasional Christmas and birthday or other stuff like that. 

But today i decided to head over to his house (like a 30 minute bike ride) and wanted to talk to them about something. It turned into a fight pretty soon and i was asked to leave. I didn't want to ride my bike back because of the longish ride plus the fact that i was sore from working out my legs earlier. I asked my mom to pick me up but didn't hear back and wanted to wait to see if she could. But this is where it got physical, my dad starts screaming at me to get out of his house and when i don't he tries to drag me out. Hes a pretty big guy about 6ft tall and 215 lbs of mostly muscle. Im about 5ft 10 inches and like 205 lbs and a lot of it is muscle. So i resisted. He got on top of me and kind of got me in a headlock but i wasn't out of breath or anything, it just hurt . So i eventually got up and started walking out. He is pushing me along the way while im just walking to the door. So im conflicted. Im worried that he has gotten back into drugs after coming so far. We live in an upper middle class neighborhood and i don't want him to throw it away even if i don't want him in my life anymore. I also would like to call the cops but i don't really have any bruises on my neck. I have a couple on my arms but they could easily be dismissed. And the only witnesses were my brother and my step-mom but i doubt my stepmom would say that happened if i do end up calling the police. So i would just like some advice and input. Was i in the wrong by not leaving and would that be trespassing? Should i call the police with my brother as witness and very minimal bruises? Any input would be appreciated.

I (24 years old) am dating this beautiful girl ( 23 years old) and we have been going out for 4 years already. On our 3rd year she decided to get a tongue piercing and of course consulted with me first. I wasn't very thrilled about that idea, but eventually gave in and said sure. So she got that. My thoughts on it ? It wasn't that great as she made it seem. It's kind of just there. I don't like it but I don't hate it either, but that is when I figured out how I felt about those things. 




 Few months ago my girlfriend dropped a  what do you think of nipple piercings ?
In her language that was straight up ' I want them '. I told her that I honestly thought it looked trashy and she had a beautiful body and there was no need to mutilate herself with those things. Then as a joke I told her why not get your clit pierced as well haha and she gave me that face.  oh my fuck  I thought to myself.  She asked me why I didn't like them so much. I'm a pretty straight up guy and told her that those things are a giant turn off and in my opinion they look trashy. Topic kind of went away for a while but then came back up again.  it increases the sensitivity  she said and I almost choked on my morning coffee because I knew exactly what she was talking about.  Ehh are you talking about your nipples or your clit ..?  I ask. She replied with  both . I asked her why does she want that shrapnel so much if she looks so good already ? I asked her if she would ever put stickers and install a spoiler on a brand new Mercedes Benz. She said no, so why do that to yourself ?  I think they are cute  well fuck. Ok so she gets them and they are ' cute ' it's not like she is going to be showing them off to anyone (I hope) so I'm going to be the only one who's going to be seeing those things ( including her ) and like I mentioned before, it's just a huge turn off for me. I tried to be open minded about I swear, but I just can't get over the repulsive reaction I get from those things.
So I got a girlfriend who wants metal on her private parts and also get belly button ( forgot to mention that ) who thinks those things are cute.

She will run to the shop and get everything I just described.

Coming up this week is an event that is really important to me (I won't get too specific) which I have been looking forward to for ages. I've paid for my ticket and taken time off work, and I know exactly what I want to wear. The only problem is that I'm afraid my insecurities are going to hold me back. Whenever I meet someone new, I compare myself to them - my looks, my weight, my personality - and it gets really hard to try and get to know someone when all you can think about is how much better they are than you. I've never really put myself out there nor had much male attention (I know that I'm young, and I know I have plenty of time) and it just feels so discouraging when I'm making progress and having a good conversation with someone I like, and then suddenly I get ignored when this new girl enters the room. I know that it's nobody's fault, but it's still hurtful and makes me feel invisible and very, very isolated.


There will be only a small group of us there, about seven or eight people, so it's not like I can avoid anyone. I know most people very well, but a couple are strangers to me. Everyone already knows each other and are friends (two of them are already dating) and I will be the only one meeting people there for the first time. I'm so scared to meet these two girls [both F, 19] who one of my male friends invited. They are both very pretty and athletic and talented and apparently very likeable (everything I've ever wanted to be) and other people, especially my male friends, are always talking about them and how great they are. I'm so frightened I'm going to spend the entire weekend tearing them down in my mind and wallowing in self-pity and I'm not going to be able to enjoy the event. I'm scared I'm going to hate them automatically and not even give them a chance, when my insecurities are my own problem and not their fault at all.


How do I stop tearing other women down, and learn how to like them for who they are, not what they look like, or how much attention they get? It's ruining my life and my relationships and I just want to be able to meet people and have fun.

Last night, I was at my boyfriends (20, M) frat party. Lets call my boyfriend Jonathan. I got really drunk, and he lives in the frat house so he took me to his room so I could get some sleep. I promptly took of my clothes (we usually sleep together naked) and crawled into his bed. I had used the restroom before I went to bed, so I thought I was good. 


Before I get too far off, I should mention that his room is right next door to one of his frat bros rooms. Lets call his frat bro Michael. 


I woke up about an hour later with Jonathan calling my name. I answered him, and he came into the room and asked him why I was in Michael's room. I was extremely confused, and thought I was still in his bed, but apparently I had come into Michael's room at some point during the night, and thought it was Jonathan's room. 

We went back into Jonathan's room and passed out. We both agreed that what probably happened was that I went into the bathroom down the hall last night, then accidentally confused Michael's room with Jonathan's. I did not remember that happening. I remember everything that happened at the party, and leading up to when I went to bed, but I must have blacked out what happened when I went to Michael's room. We both agreed to not tell Michael for the time being.

I went home this morning, and got a text from Jonathan saying that Michael told him that his chair had been wet when he got home last night. I think, in my drunken state, I had walked into Michael's room, and peed on his chair, and then fallen asleep in his bed. 

I am incredibly embarrassed. Jonathan says that if I had indeed peed on the chair, that I should tell Michael and buy him a new chair. However, I am not positive that that is what I did. I am so embarrassed that I feel I would never live it down. I know that's not very mature of me, but this has never happened to me ever.

My other brothers and I were always low-key in school and everyone liked us because we were nice, funny guys. This brother, we'll call him Asshole, is completely different. Asshole is one of those kids like we (my brothers and I) all were, we were good in school and good in sports, but he uses his powers for evil.Asshole is one of the more popular kids in school and he knows it. Because of this he treats everyone like shit and knows that they won't do anything because he is higher up on the food chain. By treats everyone like shit I mean he'll punch people in the arm and call them a pussy and pretend its a joke.  He cheats on his girlfriend that he supposedly loves because he can. Don't get me wrong, Asshole's still a funny and nice kid deep down (I fucking hope so) but he's slowly morphing into an asshole. I'm not sure if this is because he's used to being a cocky douche in school and it carries over or because he actually is a cocky douche. 

Asshole also routinely gets in arguments with our parents and doesn't accept the answer no. We smoke weed together and if he doesn't have any I let him smoke with me because I still somehow like hanging out with him. I still have some hope left for the kid. Whenever he gets weed he is like dude I smoke you up all the time and in reality he doesn't. He is the most selfish kid in the world and doesn't do shit for anybody else. 

Asshole will go to his girlfriends house (45 minutes away) or his friends house without permission and then he expects us to pick him up at midnight when he wants to go home. Asshole thinks the world revolves around him.

Asshole thinks that the fact that he gets more likes on instagram makes him a better person than anybody. He just does what he wants and I'm sick of it. I've tried telling him that he is an asshole and should stop being a dick many times but he just laughs it off because, I assume, all his friends still think he's cool. Asshole is the type of guy who, when a smarter figure tells him off, just laughs it off like a cocky shit.

I still love the kid but I love him less every day and it's fucking sad. I don't really know what to do. I've tried spending less time around him but he just acts nice to me when I try to distance myself and I fall for his shit every time because he quickly turns into an an asshole after.

I posted this in relationship_advice too (sorry if thats not done, I'm new!) because I figured I need all the help I can get... Different throw away because I could not post it here for some reason.


A bit of background: Alice met and became best friends with Maria and a boy Brandon, around the same time 5 years ago. Maria had been in a serious but extremely volatile relationship with Brandon, but they broke up (Maria cheated on him and dumped him) two years before either of them met Alice. However, the breakup was not that cut and dry, and both Maria and Brandon were extremely hurt and saddened by its end.


A year after Alice's friendship with Brandon began, he made a move on her and she declined because of Maria, but Brandon said it was very unfair and hurtful to have someone who did not want to be in his life (Maria) control his future and Alice came to the conclusion that his reasoning was fair and they started dating and have been together ever since and are going to get married. Things got extra messy when another friend told Maria before Alice and Brandon had a chance to.


Maria was furious and after one or two initial emails went completely no contact on Alice. If you ever bring up Alice, she starts yelling, calling her a f$king b*tch, and saying it was the meanest thing anyone has ever done to her. Alice spends about 75% of her time extremely saddened and depressed by it, trying to reach out to Maria to fix things, and about 25% of the time angry because she feels her decision was fair, Maria had told her she was completely over Brandon, and she thinks if the friendship was actually important Maria would be willing to try to reach some kind of resolution and because Maria has done some very unkind things in her anger. They are both not over it at all and it has been four years.


They are both some of my best friends, and I want them as my bridesmaids but I’m afraid the whole thing will blow up. They literally have not seen each other in person since Maria found out.
Maria is a really emotional person and I know it is very important to her to by a bridesmaid. Alice is my best friend and was my first real friend and was the person I originally wanted as my maid of honor. Alice has said that she doesn't mind not being maid of honor, as it might upset Maria if Alice was placed above her. We also talked about her not bringing Brandon, which she is fine with. However, I don’t think this will prevent it from being the iceiest wedding in history at this point, even if they agree to both do it for me, I don't think that will stop the bad energy. I haven’t told Maria yet that Alice will be a bridesmaid because I am afraid she is absolutely going to flip out. What should I do? Suggestions on how to approach Maria? And if Alice doesn’t bring Brandon, should I ask Maria not to bring her boyfriend?

I have a pretty tight-knit family, even though we're all spread across the eastern US. My Auntie [40s F] (4 states away) sometimes calls me for advice on how to communicate with her daughter, who we will call Jean. Jean is the spitting-image of me at that age, from the Nintendo obsession to her drawing talent and even down to her tomboyish appearance. My own other was rather strict in raising me, and as a result, I acted out a lot growing up. Auntie will often ask my opinion on how I would have rather my mother handled a situation with me when similar situations with her own daughter arise.  

A few weeks ago, Auntie phoned to tell me that she received a call from Jean's principal. Jean had been cutting. Nothing too bad, just some scratches on her wrist, but obviously something to be taken seriously. I told her that I used to do the same stupid crap like that at her age, that I thought it made me look edgy and mysterious. If Jean was doing it for attention, it was a phase and would pass. However, if it was her way of dealing with internalized struggle, she needed to be approached with love and understanding and led somewhere to get help.

Auntie took my advice and spoke with Jean. After some gentle coaxing, Jean confided in her mother that she thinks she is bisexual. This hit my aunt like a ton of bricks, but she swears she maintained composure and asked Jean if she would like to see a therapist to try and sort out her feelings in a safe, non-self mutilating way. Jean promised to never cut again, but talked her mom out of trying therapy.

In the wake of this, Jean's older brother Ben [19 M] mentioned to their mother that Jean's favorite website is Tumblr. Auntie took some time to check out Tumblr and was horrified, blocked it immediately. 

Auntie and Jean have been here for the past few days on a week long mother/daughter vacation to visit my mother and our branch of the family in our state. It's been great, I love Jean very much and relish all the time we get to spend together. We have always communicated very well and she confides in me in ways that (pre)teen girls don't feel comfortable confiding in their mothers. 

Until yesterday, during a visit to the mall, rather out of the blue, she casually mentioned to me that she is transgender. Now this wouldn't bother me one bit if she was like, 16 or maybe even 15, but that she is 11 YEARS OLD. She hasn't even had her period yet! To top it all off, she went on to talk about her bi friends at school (6th grade). Does she genuinely feel some gender dysphoria? Or have Tumblr and the internet taught these children to, like, fetishize the LGBT community??

I told my gay [40s M] coworker who personally knows a bunch of trans folk and he definitely thinks she is very young to be putting this label on herself and should be put into therapy to explore her feelings. I agree with this, but I think I would need to tell Auntie why I feel it is so important for her to talk to a professional. I hesitate, not at all because I feel like Jean would be harmed or anything, but because she told me this in confidence. I don't want to break her trust. I know Jean doesn't tell her mother because she thinks she wont be taken seriously.

23324,Non-Romantic,2ivgtn,"I need to get the details laid out as it is quite complicated.

I have a good friend David, who is 29 and is newly married to a girl Brittany aged 21.  The we hang out for scheduled nights with several others including my wife for playing video games and watching geeky tv shows and movies 2 times a week.  We are all very close, and have known each other for years.  There are always 6 to 8 of us.  Usually David hosts because he is lazy.  Whenever we do something outside of his home, he never attends.  He also manipulates Brittany into not going, even though some of these events was her idea that she was excited about and meticulously planning.  The word awkward doesn't cover these outings.

However, this couple purchased a new dog as they had to put down their old one that originally lived in David's family side.  This new dog is quickly becoming the center of attention.  This is when the problems started boiling over to outside their marriage.

During these nights, Brittany would take control of the dog, and try to train it up and such that anyone would normally do.  I personally LOVE dogs, my wife LOVES dogs, and we help her out and of course play with it.  The 3 of us.  All the rest of the others stick to their regular thing which is to either stare at the TV or their computer screens, and sometimes I would go back and forth between the game room and the other room.  After a few weeks of this, Brittany would drop hints about saying that gaming nights need to be gaming nights.  She would also drop hints that the dog needs to be trained by just her, or if the dog sleeps to let it be, or if the dog wants to play to let it be or such inconsistent things like that (and I'm summarizing as this part isn't the point).  Then after the last gaming night, she told my wife that I need to stay in the gaming room during gaming nights.  Then after the last movie night, she said that Dave does not like the attention I'm giving the dog.  A week ago, Dave buys the entire gamer group a copy of a video game that we ALL originally decided we wouldn't play.  David has been playing this game for weeks, and we all know he likes to show off.  We all know that when he does this, it isn't about playing video games, it's about showing off at how good he is at a video game.

The ironic thing is that Brittany told my wife and I that this is David's night so he (meaning I) needs to be there.  I quickly responded you mean OUR night, so that we ALL need to be here.  Brittany did not understand the implication of my response.

Now pull up to this week.  We tried getting a game all up and running but it was glitchy and some of us could not play it.  Instead, David wanted to show us a cheezy scifi tv show that somehow relates to this video game.  Us gamers had to sit there and watch this show as Dave played another video game.  We asked what he was doing, and he tells us to watch the show as it is important.  It was horrible.  I decided to step out of the game room and play with the dog as per usual.  That evening, when we got home, my wife tells me that Brittany told her that Dave is getting frustrated that I'm choosing to spend time with Brittany over David.  Let me be VERY clear on this.  It isn't about who I choose to be with, as it is clearly about me not having fun because we can't play a game and instead watching a boring show, so I simply left to play with a very entertaining puppy for a little while.

Quite frankly, I'm angry that I'm being treated like an animal.  I'm never told what the problem is, which has been stewing for over a month now.  Dave never says anything to me.  I'm being forced to do things indirectly like herded cattle, that I do NOT want to do, and not been given a choice on it.  David now has Brittany catering to this way of thinking so that it is always about David.  This is not only breaking the gamer group apart so that people don't attend due to the uncomfortable atmosphere, people have begun to notice that David is apparently picking on me now.

Now, I can understand some people might say that my wife and I are interjecting into their marriage issues.  I get that, but this is not the issue at hand.  We are very good friends and helping is what friends do, so it isn't an extreme in-your-face confrontation.  Brittany has consoled us before on some serious matters.  If we notice a problem that effects the entire group, we will deal with it.  The frustrating part is that, again, David NEVER told me any of this.  I had to find out from Brittany indirectly.  I had to hear this from my wife.  I had to ask the other friends about why David is behaving the way he is.

Let me say this again.  It isn't about me spending time with Brittany.  My wife is always present, so don't even suggest going there.  One of my friends suggested isolating myself from Brittany but this will not solve the problem at hand.

**So the detailed version of my question is: **  How do I deal with approaching David to talk?  How do I stand up for myself without crumbling this very fragile set of complicated relationships?

TL;DR:  I found out the bad way that David is manipulating our friend group so that I am being herded like cattle into doing exactly what David wants.

23351,Non-Romantic,39cg71,"There is a long backstory between our relationships, if people request it I will edit with more info. 

Our current situation is this: I live on the west coast with my husband[31/M], my brother lives in our childhood home (on the east coast), my mother is currently residing temporarily with her sister in the south. She and her parents have always had a winterly migration to warmer weather. 

My mother and I are very close - we have the same views in almost everything and she is more my best friend than anything else. I would do anything for her. 

My brother has always loved our mother as well - he's never been cruel to her intentionally. But my issue is this - he is living in our childhood home for free. He has a full-time job. My mother has always been soft with us, we often knew which parent to go to to get out of being in trouble. But this is different, this is dealing with her day-to-day living. 

Before December 2014 he was paying her rent, albeit minimal, and paying for his half of their cell phone bill. Then he got a DWI and paid for a lawyer to get this straightened out. (this was his first offence but he's had a reputation for crashing cars, getting speeding tickets) So my mother let up on him for rent and other payments, so he could get his finances in order. 

Fast forward to today, she calls me and vents because everything has built up to this point and she can't take it anymore. He basically owes her $4000 in back rent/phone payments - but what she's upset about isn't the money it's all the lying that he's done. He's always done this. They're little lies of oh yeah I'll get that done don't worry I'll do it tomorrow over and over and over again. 

The straw that broke the camel's back was over a payment for a driveway plowing service over the winter. She'd told him that he had to pay them, as she wasn't going to be there for the winter so she wasn't going to pay for the service. This was $115. He was supposed to pay it months ago. He told both her and I that he had paid it. He came up with excuses once the company called my mother and said they'd not received payment. The list of excuses and phone calls telling him to pay went on for days, including I sent him a check but he never cashed it I can't find my check book I don't want to send cash in the mail he never called me back on where we should meet to give him the cash 

My mother finally says to him Put the money in my account and I will send him a check. Brother's excuses continue, The bank won't let me do that 

Remember my mother has been paying mortgage/taxes/utilities on this house that he's been living in while she's not there. She's on a fixed income - disablility and alimony from my stepfather. 

Mother finally breaks and tells Brother - Get me the money or I will no longer accept calls from you. 

Brother is moving out to live with a friend in July. He's moved out before, so he hasn't always lived at home. When he's not living at home, my mother never sees him unless she offers to pay for a meal or something of the like. My Sister is moving in to the house with her boyfriend but they are both being deployed this December overseas. 

I don't know what to do about Brother. While I know he's not maliciously hurting her, he's still taking advantage of her. I'm watching/listening to this story from the outside and my heart hurts. I want to be with her, but I don't want to be back on the East Coast. I'm much happier where we are now - but hate being away from her. 

There's no way to knock sense into my brother. He's always made excuses. Was always the type not to do something unless he was nagged over and over. But this has been something that never gets better - he's lazy. My sister and aunts have talked to my brother about being a better son but nothing has changed.

My husband is 100% okay with whatever I want to do to help my mother. He is willing to move back East, change jobs, have her move here with us, whatever. I've spoken to him, as I was upset after the call from my mother. The way he sees it there are two options - we move back East or she comes to live with us. 

I feel like I want to take care of my mother, I spent many months living at home with her in HS where it was just the two of us. She cared for me and got me through rough times. But I don't know what to do. I also feel as if I'm missing a lot of details but I will edit if I keep getting the same questions. 

I'm totally lost. I feel like I'm not even an adult myself - even after being married for 3 years. Please give me your suggestions/insights

I work as a veterinary technician in a small, VERY busy animal hospital. I have worked very hard over the last few years to build my abilities and gain the respect of my coworkers (40s and 50s females). About 2 months ago, Sam was hired, and we were all very excited to have a guy in the hospital. To be entirely honest, I didn't care for him from the very beginning. Any time I tried to give him instruction or help him out, he would argue with me or ignore me, and upon multiple occasions he has pulled the age card, saying he doesn't have anything to learn from somebody so much younger. I decided to back off, and didn't end up forming much of a relationship with him.

Only a week into his employment, Sam has a massive seizure at work, we all freak out and call an ambulance, and it is only at this point we learn that he has epilepsy and Parkinson's. He has not yet established a relationship with a neurologist since he moved to my city, and his symptoms are out of control. After this point, he starts to no-call/no-show to about 60% of his shifts. I feel that this behavior is unacceptable, disability or no. He has the ability to text my coworker about what he ate for breakfast, but he can't call the office or our boss to let her know he's unable to come in?! My coworkers then start to become more and more maternal with him, wanting to help him when he has seizures at work, and KEEPING HIS SECRET WHILE HE STAYS CLOCKED IN AND NAPS IN THE BACK!

The scariest part is that he drives a long, difficult commute across a large city, and he never knows when he is going to have an episode. Sometimes he'll arrive to work in a haze (not sure if it is from him meds or his disabilities) and he'll say he doesn't even know how he got there. On top of that, he honestly has no potential as a technician, or even an assistant. He will NEVER be able to draw blood because of his tremors, and he has no hand strength to restrain, which has led to both him and myself being bitten. 

Over the past week, things have gotten worse. Sam instantly bonds with Sheila (38/F), who works as a relief tech and only comes in about once a month. He admitted to her that he is only a few months sober after a long and destructive heroin addiction. While she was drawing up Buprenorphine, he told her that the drugs were calling his name. Sheila told me this information in confidence.

Victoria (44/F) is perhaps the most maternal woman in the office, and has made it a priority to care for Sam when he is unwell. As a result, he has taken to texting her in the middle of the night, every night. Victoria has shown me these texts, also in confidence. He writes about how they're coming to cut his head open and they're going to put electrodes in his head, and how he has died multiple times and met god. I already felt this was a little odd, but on Thursday night, he started sexting her. He told her that he knows she wants to sleep with him and he wants to too. He said that she could take care of him and make sure he doesn't have seizures in the middle of the night, and he would take care of her too ;)) Victoria kept changing the subject and he kept veering back into sexual topics. I pressed Victoria to tell our boss, but she claimed he didn't mean it like that and she doesn't want to get him in trouble. 

My boss (49/F) is very focused on helping him, and isn't even upset that he can't come to most of his shifts. While it is a huge difficulty when he doesn't show up and we are short handed, I sort of understand this view, as I feel terrible for him and all he has to go through. That being said, it's ridiculous that he gets away with not even letting us know when he's coming or not, and gets paid to sleep in the back. 

At this point, I just don't know what to do. If I go to my boss and tell her about his drug addiction and sexting, I will possibly lose the respect and friendship of my coworkers. On the other hand, he is a huge liability to have around, both in his commute and his presence. And now he's acting completely inappropriate. What do I do?

TL;DR 
New-ish coworker started out disrespectful, then was revealed to have concealed his epilepsy and Parkinson's, which massively restrict his work ability and attendance. Now I've discovered he's only a few months clean from heroin and is tempted by the controlled substances in the hospital, and is sexually harassing coworkers. Coworkers wants to fix him, don't know whether I'm overstepping if I tell boss about his transgressions. 


**Edit** The boss I mention in the post is the owner of the clinic, so there is nobody above her that I can go to. She has taken quite a shining to Sam, and has not even tried to hide the fact that this is because she finds him attractive. Apparently, all my pre-menopausal, horny coworkers do (I say this with love). I believe this is part of the reason he feels special and they treat him as such.

 My mom and I have had a strained relationship for a while now. She comes from a physically abusive household and while she's never laid a hand on me, she has been really emotionally abusive at times. She is notorious for keeping her emotions inside and then just exploding. Growing up I saw some pretty serious fights between her and my dad, i.e. screaming matches ending with destruction of property (quite often) and once I even had to try to hold her back while she tried to push my ~75 year old dad down the stairs. She and my dad divorced and remarried each other twice when I was growing up. I don't remember any good times between them. After my dad died of cancer when I was 17, my mom spent the next year trying to convince everyone in the family that he raped her and she was essentially in the marriage against her will and he was a child molester, insinuating that he molested me and my older sister [29] but I was too young to remember it. 

I spent the next few years not knowing what to believe and developed a drug and alcohol problem. During this time I was extremely suicidal and attempted suicide once by overdosing on sleeping pills and xanax. My mom found me on the floor passed out and I spent the next three days in the ICU and the next six in a psychiatric facility. I guess she told the doctors that I was molested by my dad because that's what they focused their treatment on and I was put on a bunch of medications and  put in therapy. It didn't really help because I had no memory of a molestation or anything weird with my dad and didn't want therapy for it because I was scared that therapy would make me remember something. Anyway, after I was released, I was still in a pretty bad way and over the course of the next six months she took me off her health insurance (the rate went way up after my suicide attempt) and proceeded to put me in the mental hospital FIVE more times without my consent. She signed affidavits, citing that I was a danger to myself and she was worried about me. After a couple stints in there I told her it wasn't helping me but it was all Mother knows best, and who would believe someone who keeps going in and out of mental hospitals??

I started racking up debt from medical bills. Where I live, just going to the emergency room without health insurance is $70. A ride in an ambulance (which they would have to take me to the psychiatric facility in because I was going against my will) was around $300 if I remember correctly. And then a week or so long stay every time...you can imagine how quickly this added up. I had thousands of dollars worth of debt at the age of 20. I spent a lot of time feeling sorry for myself, doing drugs, and drinking for the next year. Finally, when I was 21, I went off all my medications (don't try this at home, kids) because they were expensive AS HELL without insurance, stopped my AA meetings because I'm not religious and it pissed me off, and got a part time job at the mall. I slowly started to build my confidence up again and became more independent.

Fast forward to last year: I'm 23, working full-time as a manager and making decent money, almost have all my medical bills paid off, and even saving a little money so I can get a car. I'm living rent-free with my mom and her boyfriend. October of last year, I actually have $3,000  saved up. It took me two years but I actually have enough for a decent used car. After I get this car, my next plan is to save up and get my own apartment by the Spring. Mom and her bf say it's no rush, I can live with them as long as I like, but I'm ready to get out on my own. I start car shopping.

Halloween: my mom gets in a huge fight with the boyfriend, starts destroying everything in the house, he threatens to call the cops, she calls me and says we need to move out that night. We stay with her mom for a week while looking for an apartment to share. I DID NOT want to move with her. She says she needs someone to share the rent with her until she pays off her school debt, and asks me for this one favor, after she has given me a place to live all these years. I feel bad and I cave, blowing through a big chunk of my two years of savings on the deposit and first and last month's rent. 

Now I am stuck in this living situation until November 30. I HATE my mom. Every time I see her I'm just reminded of everything that's gone wrong in my life. I feel like a loser. I was ready to be on my own and now I am still someone who lives with their mom. I am ANGRY. She owes me a ton of money. She told me she would pay me back the deposit and one month's rent and I haven't seen a dime. I also haven't seen anything for the internet bill or utilities, which we are supposed to be splitting.

She tries to be really nice all the time since we've moved in here, but every time she opens her mouth I am filled with years of pent up rage. I want to scream, LIAR! Dad never molested me. I didn't need to be hospitalized. You had no right to put me in the hospital. GET OUT and I will never talk to you again. 

She and her boyfriend got back together a few days after we moved in. Am I crazy for thinking that was all a ploy by her to keep me under her control for another year?? What on earth do I do? At this point I feel too angry for counseling. I feel like our relationship is beyond repair. If it wasn't for this lease I would cut off contact with her today and spend the rest of my life happy.

I moved to Germany in 2009, in order to learn German and spend much needed time with my family over here. I met my son's father about 2 weeks after moving there, and became pregnant within a few months of going out with him. I decided that instead of moving back to my parents in America, I would stay with him and try to have a happy family.

In the beginning he was a very nice, cuddly person, who was attracted to me and was also good to me. Since our son's birth, he has been extremely distant. We had sex maybe 15 times in the last 3 years. Since I have a very high libido, this is hard for me. I don't think it would be so terrible, if everytime I try to cuddle with him, or touch his body, he pushed me away. This makes me feel undesirable, disgusting. But I could also deal with that, if it wasn't for the next problem.

He has become, in the last 2 years, I don't want to say abusive, because he never cusses at me or calls me names, but it is just as painful. Every few weeks he would have a problem with something I did or didn't do, and scream at me because of it. Our son was never around when this happened, thank god, but this last time he was there to experience it.

I had been watching a music video where my hometown was shown. I started crying, because of homesickness, and I went to him so I could give him a hig and hopefully feel better. As I went to give him a hug, I accidentally stumbled over his computer cable and turned off the computer. He freaked out. damn it, are you stupid? why the hell would you do something like that! Our son was not even 15feet away from him, saw me running out crying and called his dad a stupid bum (sounds worse in german). This is the reason I'm leaving. That my son now is seeing what his dad does and how he treats me, I know now I need to get out.

My question is, how can I end things without making him hate me? I do still care that he is happy. I don't want to be the reason he is sad, but I do need to think about my son now, and his happiness.

I rescued a cat 6 years ago. He was found in a barn with two infected eyes and I fostered him after his surgery. We bonded and I decided to keep him. Three years ago we moved into a new house and my new roommate got a kitten. This seemed to stress my cat out and he got really sick and was diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease. 

He's been on (expensive) vet food for his sensitive tummy ever since. He still has soft stools but is much better. Maybe once a week he will have a soft bowel movement and will wipe his bum on a specific carpeted area. I clean it up as soon as I notice it and I clean his bum with baby wipes every day.

I explained his chronic health issues and said I was doing what I could to help him. She then said that my cat deserves someone who can take care of him and suggested that I give him to a shelter.

I talked with friends and they agreed that she crossed the line. I spoke with his vet the next day and bought probiotics to add to his food to help firm up his stools. I took him to the vet today and got him a prescription for antibiotics to help calm his tummy down. All in all I've spent $300 on him this week (on top of the $55 I spent on food every month). 

When I got home from the vet she asked to speak with me. She said things have been tense this week and asked how I was feeling. I expressed my frustration with the situation. I asked her to be understanding of the fact that my cat is a chronically ill senior and I'm doing all I can to help him, but accidents are unavoidable. I said I don't see animals as disposable and won't be giving him up. She said that she's willing to see how his medicine works and that she wants to keep the option of getting rid of him on the table. I was speechless.

She's lived here for 2.5 months and thinks she has more claim to this apartment than me and my cat. She will leave before my cat leaves. I'm doing my best to help the situation but I can't afford to drop hundreds of dollars just to prove that I'm trying. I feel like she needs to meet me halfway by being more understanding. Everyone I've talked to, including the vet, thinks she's being unreasonable and that she shouldn't have moved into a house with two cats if she can't handle occasional messes.
   
**tl;dr**: New roommate frustrated by my chronically ill cat's occasional accidents. Says he deserves an owner who can take care of him and that I should give him to a shelter. I've spent $300 this week to try to help situation but roommate still thinks giving him up should be an option.

* Many people have suggested a mat/carpet to give him for wiping and I've already done this :) He has a mat close to his litter box and I've gotten another one to put on the area where he wipes, so he'll wipe on that and not the carpet.

I'm really in a bind and hope someone can help with some advice.  Throwaway for privacy and will keep the details as vague as possible as I know they both are on reddit.


I have been friends with a couple who I met almost 20 years ago.  We've become quite close and I consider them both my dearest friends, but looked to them as a unit instead of separate individuals.  Recently the husband has been diagnosed with a degenerative disease that makes everyday tasks quite difficult.  


He's never been much of an earner and relied on the wife for most of his sustenance.  She covers his expenses, mobile bills, and keeps his appointments.  He works part time in the arts.  She makes a decent living and all seemed fine until about a year after  his diagnosis.


Since that trip to the doctor he's become a shell of his former self.  Cannot walk without being hoisted up, cannot type, cannot make a call on his mobile phone, cannot walk more than 2 blocks without having to stop and piss on the street (bladder control problems), etc.  However, he can and does drink to excess daily.


They've separated last year and I am still friends with both.


The husband is devastated by the split and the wife is trying very hard to play the role of caretaker from afar but I think she is just exhausted.  I can see why.


I have a feeling that the husband's drinking is a giant factor with his disease.  It's a CNS issue and drinking only makes it worse.  
He is drinking daily to the tune of 4-7 pints a night.  I get regular emails from him asking if I want to meet for happy hour or come to his for a glass of wine.  By regular I mean daily.  Mostly I decline, but sometimes I feel sorry for him, or am bored myself, and agree to meet him.


I understand that he is in a dark, dark place with his diagnosis and separation, but I honestly fully believe that his drinking is making this worse.  When I do meet up with him, I end up sitting there debating calling an ambulance whilst he cringes in pain, falls over whilst walking, twitches, etc.  Then I walk him home and make sure he's sorted to get up the stairs and into his flat.  This is all on top of him telling me how he misses his wife and wants his old life back. 


I should mention that he's clumsy but fully functional whilst sober.  He works.  He commutes daily with a connection from a train to a bus and navigates several flights of stairs.  He is totally fine doing this and can make the commute without issue. 


It's when he drinks that there are problems.  We will meet for a quick pint because he is so lonely and all is fine for an hour.  Then suddenly he cannot use his hands, claims to not be able to see, falls over, needs to leave immediately and needs assistance walking home... all the while moaning about how unfair it was for his wife to leave him and how he is going to die alone because of his disease.  He's mentioned suicide a few times and frequently talks about how he is going to die in his new apartment.


I'm torn because this is someone I consider to be a very close friend, but I know he his is own demise and he's doing nothing to better his situation.  He will not look for a job that will keep him off his feet (I've never done anything but what I am doing now), will not stop smoking 1.5 packs a day, will not curb his drinking.   I've tried inviting him to lunch, to sport events, to concerts... but he will not go.  He will not attend any event that is not the local pub, and will not do anything without drink.  But everything that includes drinking makes his situation much, much worse and becomes a burden to those around him.  I feel like he is using his diagnosis as a crutch and he's wasting away before my eyes.


This man has no shower curtain, TV, heating, internet, or groceries in his flat or any other friends in the area.  I feel like he expects me to obtain these things for him.  He is perfectly capable of walking to the shops whilst sober but acts as if obtaining these things is a giant mystery that will never be understood.  Questions like where can I purchase an apple? are commonplace.  And asked repeatedly.


He is going down a wormhole of pity and alcoholism and nothing I can do is working.  He is becoming dependent on me as his sole friend, his caretaker and his psychiatrist and I am not in a position to help him.


The wife is being supportive of him but I think she's burnt out.  She covers the financials and some social visits but that is all.


How can I help him?  He does not think his drinking is an issue.  I'm tempted to go with him on his doctor visits to tell them how much he's drinking to see if it counteracts with his medications.  I feel like in many ways he's transferring the neediness he once shifted to his wife onto me.  Any boundaries I try to put up are met with the side effects of his disease and how I am being unfair to someone less fortunate.  But he is acting helpless when he is not helpless and it's beyond frustrating.

23448,Non-Romantic,397d30,"So I'll try to make this as concise as possible. Some facts that will be helpful: we work in a satellite office, it's only the two of us, he was hired thanks to nepotism, and my boss will neither care nor do anything if I bring my concerns to him.

My coworker, who I'll refer to as Caligula, is very immature and wouldn't know a hard days work if he saw it. In fact, the few days when we were beyond busy and I went into to uber work mode, he said I was being aggressive and giving him anxiety. I was neither of those things, but I did often have to remind him to work instead of looking up videos on YouTube.

Not only does he spend a good chunk of time on YouTube, but he's constantly taking personal calls, some of which last upwards of an hour. 

Now in the spirit of honesty, I'll admit I do text, reddit on my phone, and occasionally play games on my phone when we have major down time. With our job sometimes there is literally nothing to do but sit around. However, he's constantly doing something on his phone. He'll send a text and then stare at it until he gets a response, often taking ten or more minutes.

Caligula often works on stuff for his personal business, putting off our own work to do so. He has also taken office items, like reams of paper, to use with his personal business. 

Even though I've brought up not being okay with any of this, he completely blows me off saying that's the advantage of working where we do: that we can do whatever we want. I've tried explaining how ethically/morally wrong his taking advantage of our lack of oversight is, but he just tells me to stop being aggressive. 

In the mornings it usually takes him a good hour to even start to do any work, and when I've told him we need to get it done in case we are slammed later on the day, which happens often enough to be a real concern, he tells me he likes to relax in the morning and work hard in the afternoon. But here's the rub: he almost never works hard. But he obviously doesn't see it that way. 

Caligula also likes to stall work by bringing up topics to  debate , which means he wants to prove how intelligent he is because he can regurgitate something he heard recently on a podcast, and Zeus help me if I don't agree or actually prove him wrong. 

He's ex military (kicked out, long crazy story), always has to top people's stories, is rather condescending, and is a bit paranoid.

So I guess what I'm asking is how the hell do I deal with this without losing my mind or being sent to prison?

Tl;Dr: coworker is driving me being crazy, what's a good way to get through to him?

23468,Non-Romantic,27ske5,"Hey all,

I'm half-Korean and I moved from Philly, USA to Seoul, South Korea 7 years ago. I've known my 30-year-old Korean cousin since I was born, basically, but we bonded more when I finally moved here (I only recently learned Korean and hung with him a few times on family trips before my move). I'll preface this by saying we communicate in Korean, so something might be lost in translation.

Anyway, honestly he's not the type of person I'd be friends with. Compound that with the Confucianist older brother relationship I'm *expected* to respect (which I'm accustomed to, but it's *not* my natural state), I'm not a huge fan of him, but he seems to genuinely care about me.

Anyway, we don't see each other a lot, and he would drunk dial me staring about a year or two ago with stuff like:

- I love youuuuu

- Sorry we don't meet moreeee hold on talk to my drunk friend lol (HARRO?? HOWAYOO?? I'M PINE TANK YOU LOLOL ROFLLL, then I listen to them cracking up for a few minutes...)

- Why dont u come see meeeeee

- Why dont u call meeee

- Cry about his long-term gf who dumped him, saying he's not cultured, stupid, boring, blah blah blah listen to him drunk-cry, etc. (Why does he do this to me...; last time I went there he introduced me to his 4 best buds who he hangs with every day, I don't want the responsibility of emotional care-taker; we don't have that kind of rapport, and *does* have shoulders to lean on)

And these drunk dials would last a fucking **hour**, at midnight when I'm either relaxing, chilling with my girl, or getting ready for bed. It happened like once a month, so I started ignoring it because it's fucking annoying. 

Anyway the other day he called me at like 7pm, which isn't his usual drinking time, but I *could* definitely imagine him drunk at dinner with buds or something, so I ignored. Then he texted me You really trying to piss me off CALL ME NOW And he called me again today (maybe 2 days since the last one) and I just turned my phone screen off, put it on silent, and flipped it over. 

I'm now at the point where I feel like initiating or receiving *any* contact from him will just open a can of drama I don't have time to deal with (nor would I really want to). Unless he sent a text apologizing or something, but I don't think his asian-ego would allow him to do such a thing.

Am I wrong to be stone-walling him? Do I owe him an explanation? I was thinking about putting together a text about why I'm not answering him, including reasons like:

- Drunk dialing is fucking annoying

- 100% of the times we met, I made a 1.5 hour trip (one way) out to see him (probably 10 times or something); he's never come this way

- He has zero interest in my culture, language, or interests, and expects me to do what he wants to do: play soccer, get blasted, and then sleep on his sweat-crusted blanket on the floor of his dingy apartment (I woke up next to a giant pube last time i stayed there)

- I feel like he treats me like a high school or college student or something. He doesn't come from money, so I understand maybe it's a defense mechanism hiding an inferiority complex or something (not that i'm rich, but maybe being American or being more traveled makes him feel defensive?), but why would I want to deal with this?

Urgh. Anyway. Honestly, it would be nice to be on good terms with him, but maybe as a once-a-year reunion catch-up drink kinda thing. I work, I have buddies here (on my side of Seoul), and a great gf who I spend a lot of time with.

On the flip side, I wouldn't *really* care if we just cut contact. It'd suck losing a cousin or something, but he was never a big part of my life, and the good times we had are overshadowed by the annoyances.

Has anyone gone through something like this? Help plz

Background: About 3 years ago, I was looking for a roommate on Craigslist and I moved in with this girl, Erica. We ended up becoming best friends and shared everything. I would let her borrow my car every now and then since her car was constantly breaking down. Now a little over a year ago,  I was phone less for a while and came home one day to find my car gone from its parking spot. After checking iMessage on my laptop, I saw a text from Erica saying she had borrowed my car. I was initially upset because I had never given her permission to borrow my car at the moment. I told her it wasn't cool to take my car since I needed it and to get home soon. Long story short, a car rear ended her on the freeway and my car was totaled. 


I was pissed. I was freaking out because I didn't have good insurance and I was extremely upset because my car was taken without my permission. After this, our relationship fell apart. I felt resentful against her, I felt like she did not support me when I was stressing over the insurance companies, and we basically stopped communicating. Living at home became awkward so I moved out on a whim. After I moved out, we stopped talking. I really missed her and our friendship because I never had a friend like her but I was too proud to talk our problems out. 


Now about my sister: My sister Melissa and I have always been close. While my car situation was going on, I would constantly vent to her about how stressed I was. Melissa had previously met Erica once and right off the bat, I could sense Melissa didn't like Erica. Erica never did anything to her but I could just sense her dislike. 


So about two months ago, Erica texted me out of the blue. She apologized for how things went down, said she missed me, and seemed to really regret her actions/attitude after the accident. We met, talked, cried, and decided to mend the friendship. We both got everything off our chests and I was ecstatic. I felt and still feel like she was genuinely sorry and I was stoked we were able to move past this.


The problem: After this, I told Melissa and she was pissed. She said it was stupid of me to forgive Erica and be her friend. She asked if I would invite her to my graduation and I said I would consider it if my mom was okay with having Erica at my graduation party since she would be hosting it (my mom was completely supportive of me and Erica becoming friends again). Melissa went off on me over text and cussed me out. She threatened to not come if Erica was there and I said the decision would be hers at the end of the day if she wanted to come or not. She said if I wanted to have that bitch at my graduation instead of her, then I was stupid and she wasn't going to go. I told her I would love for her to be at my graduation and she shouldn't be acting like this. If I was okay with being friends and forgiving Erica, then she should be okay with my decision and respect it. I told her I'm an adult and can make my own decisions but she wasn't having it. She continued to cuss me out and call me stupid and held her ground. I was livid but decided to not reply to one of her texts and I cooled down instead. This happened 2 days ago and we haven't spoken since.

So my question is, am I in the wrong? Or is Melissa? Should I not invite Erica to my graduation since my sister dislikes her? Should I try talking to my sister again? For the record, my sister is pregnant so it could be hormones but that doesn't excuse her behavior. I also let Erica know of the situation and she volunteered to not come to my graduation to avoid issues with my sister but I told her this wasn't necessary because I thought my sister was acting childish and making this about her. I would appreciate any advice.

I've been dating my GF since last summer and we moved-in together August of last year.  The relationship has been absolutely wonderful, and all my friends and family adore her.  I feel I am truly blessed and I want to marry her one day.

Throughout the relationship, she has been dropping hints to me that she wants her family to move from China to America.  That is all fine and good, and I have no problem with that.

However, her parents visas got approved a couple of weeks ago and have already booked flights to arrive in a week and a half.  Her mom will visit for one week and go back, **WHILE THE DAD WILL STAY WITH US FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS TO LOOK FOR A JOB WHILE LIVING IN OUR 1 BR APT. It get's worse - HE CAN'T EVEN SPEAK ENGLISH!!!**   

Some background on her dad - Sorry, but he is a dirtbag.  He has been cheating on his wife practically the whole marriage with several different women.  Him and his wife run their own small business, but he will take some of the business money and either waste it on other women or will use it to trade stocks which most of the time will end in a net loss.  Meanwhile, his wife practically runs the business.

He is a crazy driver as he caused three accidents which hurt his wife every-time.  The last accident happened literally a week ago.  He's the type where if you give him an inch, he will take a mile.  This guy will be living in my apt.!!!

Her parents never asked for my permission, or even my GF's, but instead invited themselves over and have already booked the flights. 

I never gave approval for them to come.  My GF never asked me if it was OK for her dad to stay this long.

Just for the record, I pay 2/3 of the rent since my income is higher than my GF's.

I talked with my GF last night and mentioned that I don't feel comfortable with her dad staying this long - Either he needs to find another place to stay immediately or have a more defined exit strategy.  Unfortunately, my GF sided with her dad and doesn't feel supportive of kicking him out.

Give the type of person he is, I'm assuming that he will contribute nothing in terms of rent, bills, or food and I will have to take care of him. 
   
The only out that I have is that the lease is up in August and I will refuse to sign another lease anywhere until he is living somewhere else, or plane tickets are purchased.  Also, I have friends and family in the area that I crash for a night here and there.

I have to pay rent, since it will hurt my credit otherwise.  I have no choice.

Having him live with us indefinitely is unacceptable.

 To start things off me and my mother generally speaking have an OK relationship in the eyes of others just because being the type of person I am whether I dislike someone or not I'm friendly though I don't hide the fact I dislike them. My mother and I have never gotten along well in private. She's manipulative and uses just about every excuse she can to get out of taking responsibility for her actions and blaming it on others in the household (usually myself). Recently I injured myself and had to go to the hospital for it, well she had told me beforehand that she would handle the medical expenses and not to worry. So i agree to go to the hospital, well once we leave and I have a $512 dollar bill she tells me that she refuses to pay it. Now at the time I was attending college and was not employed. So I spent the next few days discussing things with the hospital and they told me I could get help with the bill if I did a form that they would mail to me and gave it to the billing office which I thanked them and waited for it in the mail. My mother usually gets the mail and it magically didn't come any of the three times they mailed it to me. So i print it off and fill it out and ask her if she can take me to the hospital to give it to them. She says yes but not today as she has work to do. So I put it in my room and during the next few days it vanishes. At this point I'm angry and say screw it and apply for a plethora of jobs just to pay it off. I get hired at walmart roughly four weeks ago I get one paycheck and tell my mother that I'm going to be saving my money that I don't put into my bill to pay it off so that I can have a better future and move out at some point. Which doesn't go over well with her so she yells at me and throws a fit telling me I don't contribute to the household and how terrible a person I am. How shes spent so much money on me over the years and how I'm horrible for saving money instead of giving it to her. 


She recently took herself her boyfriend my sister and my sisters boyfriend as well as my youngest sister on a vacation to the beach and I was told to set up things to take care of our multiple animals on top of all of my transportation to and from work(this part I was fine with the animals I was not) my mother had planned this vacation before I got my job and had my schedule multiple weeks in advance to plan things for the animals. I of course did this regardless of how I felt about it I won't punish my animals because I don't like the situation.


 So they get back from vacation and immediately start in on me with attitude because I was left at home with very minimal food as in we had chips eggs hamburger etc in the fridge to eat and milk and tea for me to drink. Now this is fine with me my monthly food cost is around $50 on an expensive month ( I eat solely cup ramen and hot pockets are my luxury food. I drink water bottles) So today my mother tells me that I do nothing to contribute to the house financially and that because of this my friends when they come over can only eat food that I buy myself. Now this can be viewed as more than understandable why should someone have to pay to feed someone other than their own family. My friends don't eat the food from upstairs, my friends eat the food that I eat for the month as in ramen and hot pockets they also bring their own drinks. They're over maybe once or twice a month at max. My sister however has friends over almost every weekend that are all employed, break just about every rule in the house (smoke inside, be noisy till 4am, have sex in my sisters room, and a few times they've drunk or done drugs in our living room). My mother tells me that my friends are loud and horrible and eat everything vs my sisters who eat about $60-100 worth of food every visit. 


So now to get to my point, is there anything you all would recommend I do in this situation? I plan not to have any contact with my mother or my sisters after I move out just because I know even if I'm not in the house I'll somehow still get blamed for their problems in life and I can't handle them. Is there anything financially I should do? I want a roommate when I move out and I have a few people I can ask but aside from that I have no idea what my options are. Just any overall advice on how to escape this situation would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance you all.

TL;DR: Mother dropped a $500 medical bill on me told me she would help, sabotaged me at every step. Mother blames me for all expenses in the house even though my monthly cost is roughly $100 including water, electric, and food. tells me I do not contribute when I do not give her my paycheck and instead pay off my hospital bill. Looking for advice on how to escape this situation and my family.

Edit: I forgot to mention that around June or July of this upcoming year is essentially my deadline to get out of the house. My mother is planning to move to a town about two hours away.

23541,Non-Romantic,2o05it,"Okay so, I live with my mom, my sister, and my grandmother in a house (Parents divorced when I was 10). My mom pays for rent and utilities. I pay my bills (student loans, phone, medical bills, etc.) and buy my own food.

When I got a job at 19 I would give my mom $100 to help with some bills. I moved out at 21 for less than a year and had to come back home because of a back injury. I lost everything, and still owe my roommates rent for the rest of the lease. My dad had to literally come get me since I couldn't walk and ran completely out of money.

My mom let me come back home to heal and I finally got another job this past February. With the new job, my mom asked that I give her $200 for bills to help with the house. I didn't mind that since she let me come back home, but recently there's been a rift with my sister and my mom that makes me wonder what I should be doing too. 

My sister went to school about an hour away, and my mom helped with paying for her expenses. When she finally finished school, and got a job, my mom asked that she helped with the rent and my sister refused. She claims that our mom should be helping us start our lives and shouldn't be asking us for money. My mom says that we are grown now and that this is how the world is and she needs to help out. 

So my sister now has been mostly staying with our grandparents, where she doesn't have to pay for rent or anything. She works close to their house so it makes sense too. She comes home sometimes since all her stuff is here, but now I'm beginning to wonder if my sister is right.

I do live in this house with my mom, and I know that I need to contribute. But I can't help but wonder if I could have already moved out of here if I didn't have to pay my mom. The money I've been giving her I could have been saving, and I would have a good amount by this point. I'm a bit torn with taking my sister's side and thinking about myself and how to better my life, but at the same time I know I can't just refuse to give my mom any help with maintaining this house. 

Who is right here? What should I do? I obviously don't want to live at home forever, I'm 24 for christ sakes. But at the same time I'm not sure if saving the money to get out while mooching off my mom is fair. At the same time, my mom has a huge amount of money saved, and I don't have anything saved because my extra income is going to her. 

Any insight would be great

Thanks guys!

23551,Non-Romantic,2bxbbf,"Went out with my friend to our favourite bar where there's a bartender who works there that she always talks about how nice and goodlooking he is. 

Later that night she started to talk about her extremely low confidence due to being overweight and never really being asked out. She talked about how she avoided mirrors so she didn't have to look at herself and how men just saw her as the fat girl. 

I told her this was wrong and that she was beautiful and smart (she is) and that maybe she need to get a bit more confidence and talk to guys first. 


I convienced her to go talk to the bartender but she wanted me to come sit with her. I agreed and we went to the bar. 

The bartender came and talked to us a few times and generally was talking to her which made me really happy. I was sitting on my phone typing when he suddenly took it out of my hands, typed in his number and left. 


She was clearly *really* hurt by this. She wasn't mad at me - and said she wasn't mad at me even - but I felt and still feel AWFUL about it. She's been talking about this guy for weeks. I don't even know why he gave me his number. I don't drink and don't go to the bar nearly as often as she does but he said I was refreshing which also hurt her. 


I don't know what to do. I want to help her build her confidence because she's amazing and one of my best friends. 

She said she wasn't surprised that he wanted mine and that guys like him were just a pipe dream for girls like her. (She wasn't being overdramatic either, she genuinely believes this.)


I am of course not talking with this guy or starting anything. If he tries I am going to say that I am not interested. 

How do I help my friend feel better about this? 

She believes she's the ugly fat girl who no one wants and that he showed her that he has no interest by putting his number in my phone. I really hurt her and I don't know what to do. 

I'm afraid something like this might happen again because in all honesty guys talk to me very easily but I always do my best to be kind to everyone. Sometimes that gets taken the wrong way. 

I also never flirted with the bartender and was purposely keeping quiet so they could talk. It really caught me off guard and I feel very bad about it because it was my suggestion for her to go get his number and somehow I ended up with it...

23552,Non-Romantic,3ax1s1,"I'm shaken up right now. I'm writing on behalf of my childhood best friend (Scott). I just got off the phone with him.

Quick background on Scott: he's Korean-American (meaning he was born here, but his parents are Korean immigrants). He just finished his freshman year of college. He has two younger siblings and a girlfriend.

The problem: 

I just got off the phone with Scott. He and his girlfriend are interested in taking a road trip to Niagara Falls. The whole trip should only last about 3 days. This trip would include her whole family - not just the two of them.

When he asked his mother for permission, she blew up at him. For no foreseeable reason. She screamed at him, saying he was crazy for even asking. She took away his keys, called him selfish &amp; crazy, said that his two younger sisters need his help at home (which is not true; they're both in high school and fully capable of taking care of themselves).

The worst part is that she threatened to kick him out. Right before he hung up, he said his mother came in the room and would talk later. He sent me a text saying I think she's kicking me out now and I have not heard from him again.

I often frequent this subreddit so I know that a lot of the advice will include moving out on his own since he's legally an adult. But please, that isn't going to be helpful advice. Scott has a part-time job at a grocery store. He can't live on his own. He doesn't have the resources nor the money to deal with his own place. 

Therapy is also out of the question - his mother would *never* agree. She doesn't believe she has done anything wrong, despite all the pain she's inflicting on Scott. She also doesn't speak English well at all (she can understand, but she can say only a handful of words). 

Scott never talks back, he doesn't rebel. Out of all his siblings, he talks back the least. The few times he has talked back, he's landed his ass outside their house. This is not the only time this has happened.

Scott has brought up the fact that in America, much of this would be borderline abuse. But his mom would always retort with you're Korean and you're going to be raised Korean. We will discipline you the way we were disciplined when we were younger. 

And also about his dad - he doesn't help. In a way, you could say he's scared of Scott's mom. He doesn't want to do anything to upset her either. 

And from what Scott has told me, his parents are fond of his girlfriend. So I don't believe her distorted reaction stems from a rooted disliking to his SO.

**TL;DR** With harsh Korean parents that display abusive behavior with no remorse for their method of discipline, what is a 19-year-old to do?

23576,Non-Romantic,21rmqk,"My brother and I are 5 years apart. I left home when I was 16 for many reasons, some being that being around my other siblings who were complete leaches on my parents drove me crazy. My oldest brother lived in our 5 bedroom home with his girlfriend and their four kids at the time. He was verbally and physically abusive to everyone and I was a teenager who hated him and living in that house. My brother and I were close and he would always find refuge in my room. When I left, I knew I left him behind but at the time, I couldn't do anything else. We both grew up in a household with no rules, no consequences for our actions, and frankly no expectations. Fast forward to now. I am graduate student living 3,000 miles from home and the first person in my family to get a bachelors, move out of our home state, and to ever even think about higher education. My brother has been stuck in alternative school for the past 3 years and he just can't seem to graduate. I have spent alot of time talking to him about his future and trying to motivate him and sometimes it feels like I'm getting through to him...but then today, I get a call from my sister and she tells me that he's not going to graduate. That he's been lying to us all and he will likely need another year. He sits in his room all day and plays video games. I seriously don't know what do, how to help him, or how to talk to him anymore. I just need advice on what to do. I'm so far away but I want to help him. 


I have thought about just moving him out here and getting him away from home. I don't know how he would benefit from it other than that it would take him out of this place he is stuck in. My fear is that he will never venture outside of the small shit town we grew up in and that he will become like my brothers who have never left it. My parents are traditional hard working people. They came to this country with one thing in mind: to give us a chance to make something of ourselves. They had no idea what that meant, or how to help us get there and it's really shown itself in my siblings. Around our home, having a kid before 18 is normal. Having my parents practically raise that kid is too. He, thankfully, hasn't gone that route. He has told me that he feels like everyone compares him to me and I know that it's true. But, all I want for hi m is to be independent and happy.

23586,Non-Romantic,2ts0mm,"Hi reddit! I'm gonna try my best at explaining this in the best way possible. First I'd like to apologize, in advance, for my English, as I am Dutch. Secondly; some details may be forgotten as this is a very long and confusing story.


Let's begin at the beginning; I was 16 when my dad lost his job as a cook. He had worked for that company for 12 years and they fired him. Being part of a familay that doesn't earn that much, I knew we were gonna feel this one.


My dad started drinking as we went down this unfamiliar road of financial stress. I always felt  smarter than my family, but my drunken dead mostly had none of it, so we had a lot of fights. I mostly felt sorry for my mom for marrying him, but also for my dad cause I know how hard he has it.

Now my family does not have a lot of money and being surrounded by friends who go on expensive holidays and get their school and drivers license paid for, I feel under privileged (even though I know that is very selfish of me).

No one will hire my dad because he is too old and can't fdo a lot of things like sending a well spelled email or read well.

I know this may make no sense at all since its a very long story and there are a lot of things going on, but the most important thing here is that I feel that my parents are not the best parents in the world because they're not tryung hard enough for themselves and for me and I feel that's pretty selfish. What do I do?

If you have any questions, please ask so that I may make this situation more clear.


Thank you very much!

23594,Non-Romantic,2xnw3z,"When I first met my MIL when my husband and I were dating, back in 2008, I liked her fine. My default for pretty much anyone is to like them and give them the benefit of the doubt until they give me a reason not to, which doesn't happen very often. But as my husband and I dated I was shocked by how she treated him. Nothing abusive but she blamed him for everything, even things that couldn't possibly be his fault, and her reaction to these things were far more severe than rational. He was her whipping boy, and meanwhile his brother was like a golden child, he could do no wrong. It appalled me.

Fast forward a few years, her behaviour has improved significantly. Looking back I think part of her behaviour was poorly addressed frustration that he lived at home longer than she liked, (he paid off some student loans, then got laid off for year shortly before he was about to move out) though she never actually told him she wanted him to move out. My husband thinks she was menopausal as well, plus he also finally called her out on how she gives his brother special treatment. I don't really think any of this excuses it necessarily but it does explain why it's much better now.
But the way she acted before just left such a strong taste in my mouth I can't seem to get over it, and now that I'm pregnant with the first grandchild, in dreading how much more she'll likely want to come over to see him.

Now to be clear, I've never been anything but polite to her. I'll gladly go along with my husband to family dinners/holidays that he wants to go to, I would never refuse to let her see her grandson once he's born. And if that was it, it'd probably be fine.
But she clearly wants to be friends with me as well. She's suggested outings, just the two of us without my husband along. I generally just give a generic, non commitment response but most recently she wants to take me for lunch then to pick out fabric for a blanket she's planning to make for my son. Which would, and should, be lovely except that spending time with her feels like pulling teeth. Even when she wants to do something nice for me i resent it. 

Now as I've been trying to think of how to decline without hurting her feelings, and thinking of the situation in general the more I realize my thinking seems to have evolved from a valid dislike for bad behaviour to a somewhat obsessive and toxic mindset. I caught myself thinking that I don't want to go and have a nice time with her because I don't want to like her, even though that's ridiculous, never mind that life would just be so much easier if I did!
Anyway I've since accepted her invitation to lunch but I'm wondering if anyone has suggestions for how to just make myself like her.

My parents and especially my dad took some time to come around to us since I am south asian and she is black and asian.  It was definitely a process to get them to accept her as they wanted me with someone of my own race but eventually they saw how happy we made each other and how accepting my fiancee was of our culture.  

Anyways, my fiancee and I were thinking of just a quick courthouse wedding or a small one with just family and close friends &gt;25 people.

I'm just upset at this moment by a fairly small incident. I'm hanging out in my room today, and it's roasting, I was alone, so I went topless, something rare for me. My mom knocked on my door, I called out to wait, and she came in anyway. I covered myself with a dressing gown both because I generally hate people seeing me uncovered, and because I didn't want her to see my nips since HRT has changed them, and she gave me the same disappointed, disgusted look she gave me when she confronted me about being trans and other stuff several months ago. Surely that's unfair? She invaded my space, my privacy, etc. I know it's a petty complaint, but it's upsetting me so much right now. I'm worried this will cause her to corner and confront me again soon.


It feels like the last year, and more, of my relationship with her has been so, so toxic. She reacted so poorly to me coming out (last July/August, I forget), she's diagnosed me with Asperger's, she tells me I'm damaging my body, that I'm naive, that I'll likely never find a partner. She used my sexuality (which she knows nothing about) to say maybe I shouldn't transition, she says I'll hurt the family and especially my sisters, she asks me to wait and wait and wait before doing anything. Any time I've talked to her, she subtly tries to influence me away from anything trans-related, she tells me I was so male as a child, she just hurts me over and over again, though unintentionally I *think*. In reaction to all of this, I've gone on HRT (**hormone replacement therapy, simulates, for me, female endocrine system and changes my body accordingly**) unbeknownst (I think) to her, and I've come out to all my peers, more or less, unless they're related to my workplace. After summer, everyone will know, and I'll hopefully be moving out (something they don't know about my plans for either).

For the record, she also knew about my depression and self-harm for quite a few years, and rather than attempting to help me or send me to a professional, she kept quiet, and only recently came out with her knowledge, in an attempt to guilt trip me around new years.

I know I'm obviously presenting this from a really biased perspective, but even keeping in mind that she's just trying to help me, I can't find it in me to want to forgive or reconcile with her. I'm working on being able to move out of home, I'm working on being able to transition, and I'm working on doing it without any help from my parents, because otherwise I fear they'll be able to influence me with guilt or emotion. Am I being an asshole? I would love to live my life without them, but it feels like I'm being a reactive teenager, like I'm being unfair and rebellious and unkind. That doesn't for a second change how I feel, though, and that's a whole lot of upset and hate and anger.

23634,Non-Romantic,2j7u4s,"Hello Reddit!  I need your advice on how to handle a situation with a friend, let's call him Ed, who has suddenly stopped talking to my boyfriend Tom and me.  Tom and I have already asked advice from friends and family, but we are getting a mixed bag of suggestions and would like some additional help!

**Backstory**: Tom and I grew up in neighboring towns and have a bunch of mutual friends from our childhood, including Ed.  Ed and Tom grew up a few houses away from each other and considered their relationship brotherly, where Ed viewed Tom as a little brother that he watched out for and supported in various situations over the years.  Surprisingly, Tom and I did not actually meet until a few years ago when Ed introduced us after all of us moved back to our home state post-college.  Tom and I had known of the other's existence, but never met before going away to college!  

After introducing us, Ed suggested to both of us that we would be good together and should date.  Now, it did not exactly happen right away, but over time, as Tom and I got to know each other, we fell in love and before we knew it, we were serious about our relationship and now live together!  The entire time, Ed seemed happy for us and continued to hang out with us, along with our other mutual friends, and everything seemed hunky-dory.

**Present Day**:  Up until about a month ago, Tom and I would hang out with Ed and our other friends on a regular basis, particularly when we would go back to our hometowns to visit (Tom and I live a little over an hour away from where we grew up).  Ed also lived (he recently moved back home) about an hour away, but in a different direction, so the best place for all of us to get together was back where we all grew up.  

Then, one day, when it was just Tom, Ed, and me hanging out, Ed started acting kind of distant and, when Tom left us alone for a few minutes, Ed blurted out that he would prefer it if Tom and I stopped doing any PDA while he was around.  Now, Tom and I never did anything extreme, except for the occasional kiss, hand-holding, and hug, so I thought at first that Ed was just one of those people that is uncomfortable around any kind of PDA, but at this point, Tom and I had been dating a year...so why was he uncomfortable now?  And so, I asked him and he simply replied that he *still* likes me...and I was pretty much thinking WTF?! because Ed had *never* shown any interest in me, even when I was single when I first moved back to our home state.  I was in a state of shock, so I mumbled Ok... and that was that.  He asked that I not tell Tom, but of course I told Tom (in private later on)...how could he think I would hide that from the man I love?!  The whole thing just floored me, as it did Tom, and we were not sure what to do at that point...

Well, Tom and I hoped that Ed would eventually get over himself, since he was actually known for developing crushes on girls in relationships, but the following week when we all hung out with our other friends, Ed blatantly ignored both of us.  He actually walked out of the house we were all hanging out at less than an hour after Tom &amp; I came over to hang out.  I texted him asking what was wrong and he told me that seeing Tom &amp; I together took him off guard...so Tom &amp; I eventually left a couple hours later, with Ed never returning during that time.

Ever since that incident, Tom has been trying to get a hold of Ed to simply talk about what they normally talk about, like computers, video games, other random guy stuff...but Ed has not responded.  This is the *first* time Ed has ever done something like this to Tom and, understandably, Tom is very hurt that one of his best friends is treating him like this.  I have also tried contacting Ed by asking him how his dog is doing (he recently got a puppy and had been asking me for advice, since I have a dog of a similar breed).  Nothing.  To us, he has simply disappeared.

We recently went on a camping trip with one of our other mutual friends, Rick, and when we asked Rick what was going on, he mentioned to us that Ed had lost his job recently (company went bankrupt) and he was completely broke, so now my suspicion is that Ed is taking it out on us because Tom has everything he wants: the girl, a good job, financial stability, etc...  Ed grew up as a bit of a spoiled brat, so now that is not getting everything his way, he is throwing a temper tantrum of sorts...at least, that's what it seems like to Tom and me.

At this point, we have tried reaching out to Ed, but to no avail.  We are planning on visiting our parents this weekend and know that Ed moved back in with his mom due to his job loss, so we are hoping to stage an intervention of sorts and talk to him.  Would this be a good idea or should we just let it go, hoping that he gets over himself?  This whole situation is making our other friends uncomfortable and it is hurting Tom &amp; I at Ed's sudden horrid treatment of us...

23638,Non-Romantic,2vwfh5,"I have a good friend that I've known for a little over a year now. About 8 months ago we were drinking and talking about relationships, and he told me that when he gets married he'd like me to be one of his groomsmen, but since they weren't engaged yet it was an unofficial asking (his words). 


Fast-forward to last week: He and I were going over his proposal plan and he brought up who would be in the wedding party, and to my surprise I was not included. He's recently been spending time with his girlfriend's sister's boyfriend (who has only been in the picture for 4 months) and he wants to ask him instead. When I asked why, he said because I've known him longer (they went to the same high school for a year and used to skateboard at the same skate park; they didn't really become friends until 4 months ago). He said that he'd like me to be in the wedding, but he wants each of them to have the same number of people in their party and his girlfriend currently only has three people in mind (her best friend and her two sisters) so I would only be in if she adds another person. 


I told him I didn't want to argue my way into his wedding or cause a fight, but that I was upset because he'd unofficially asked me months ago and now he's changed his mind.He didn't seem to understand why I would be bothered, and then our conversation was cut short because he had to leave for a date. 


They just got engaged last night. I feel like I should talk to him about all this, but I don't know how much of a deal I should make about him changing his mind and if it's worth damaging a relationship that I genuinely care about because my feelings were hurt.

23641,Non-Romantic,28dxdz,"I [30/F] work in a very small office, 3 people in total.  The owner [55/M] and his [50/F] wife and then myself.  Been here for 7 years or so now, pay is decent with future raises a possibility.  It's close to where I live and I can go home for lunch every day and take my dogs out for a walk.  Also the owner and his wife are for the most part nice to work with/for.  When there's things that need to get done the owner and I buckle down and get things done.  The wife, while she's nice, kind of comes and goes as she pleases and when she's here she spends the majority of her day online shopping.  This just isn't me saying that, often the owner will go into her office and make a comment about it.



Without making this too long the work breakdown is as follows: Owner does the sales, the wife invoices out/collects incoming payments (and we do have an accountant do the end of the month books and stuff that we hire out to do) and then I do pretty much the rest.  This includes everything from freight (intl/dom) setting up new customers, taking orders, sending out samples, anything IT related, creating POs through QuickBooks and various other things.  It's a lot of work but it keeps me busy and like I mentioned above, there are other perks.



The wife is the day to day accountant, I do more accounting then I would like but the point is moot at this point.  Our Quickbooks is never correct on a daily basis in terms of inventory so I have to use a separate system on my own to keep a running count on it because I'll often get a call from a customer asking how many of x product can I ship out that day.  I use to just use an excel spreadsheet but found a nice free program that allows me to keep better track.  Also because she doesn't want me to put in Sales Orders the moment I get them because I may not have a PO number, won't know the ship date, batch number, etc. she says it messes up with her monthly numbers.  Fine, we use Salesforce (the owner and I do, she doesn't want to learn how to use it) so with some page customization on the setup I am able to enter in each incoming order and then in my other system account for the inventory.  So between these two system I have everything 100% accounted for.  When something is ready to ship that's when I generate the sales order through her system/Quickbooks and then she creates the invoice.  Also I should mention that all sales reports that the owner looks at are generated through her system.



So I get in this morning at 8am, boss comes in about 8:30am (which is the norm) and asks me if I billed out the freight for an order.  I say yes and leave it at that.  The wife comes in around 10am (which is early for her) and asks me to come to her desk to ask a question.  She points to some things on her screen and some printout and says that the last freight bill wasn't put into the system.  I broke my glasses a few days ago so only wear them when I drive at the moment, so I can't see a darn thing she's pointing out.  Ask to see a copy of it so I can go over it.  Our offices are small so my boss comes over and rips me a new one.  Says he should fire me on the spot and take it out of my pay (It's $8000 so I couldn't pay for it) and just goes off on me for a good 20 minutes.



So I just get the paperwork and go over it all and everything matches up 100%.  Everything was billed out, put through the system and I have no idea WTF the wife is on to not see it.  Granted on the report it has sales orders, invoices, incoming wires, invoices, etc. for each order.  You just have to match up the PO numbers and yeah, they match up.  I didn't think I didn't put it through in a sales order but it was over a week ago and at the time I was getting my ass chewed out I didn't have any of this paperwork to look over so I had nothing to defend myself with.



My boss is traveling internationally and won't be back in the office until next Monday.  Do I bring this up to him?  Do I bring it up to her?  I'm just really upset right now for getting my ass chewed for something that I did correctly.  I'm not perfect, I do make mistakes every now and then but not these kind of mistakes.  I don't want it to seem like I'm out to get her in trouble or anything, yet at the same time I'm really freakin pissed off that this happened.

So, my brother has always been pretty depressed and miserable, and it's always made my family very concerned. My parents really do their best to support him, but we have always wished he'd take more time to figure out what would make him healthier and happier.


 In the last three years, he's married his high school girlfriend, gotten a full-time job and left home. This was met with reservation on our part -- his wife suffers from severe social anxiety and refuses to work or apparently get help for her condition. My brother worked overtime night shifts at a fastfood place (he never finished any education after HS) for years, walking home alone after shifts because he didn't want to bother her (they live in Minnesota, it gets really cold). 


Recently, my brother called my mom to explain that he is trans. I got the info second-hand (I live in a different country), and while my mom is very accepting and open, she's not really up on trans vocabulary, and her phone call to me was pretty garbled. In the end, though, my parents would rather have a happy daughter than a miserable son and if this makes their child happy, they'll support it.


Honestly though, my sibling has only discussed this with their wife, who has no real world experience in anything. Apparently my sibling hasn't spoken to any trans resource centres or online communities or anything. They live in a small town in the Midwest, there are no trans-positive counselors I could find in the area, even.


Quite frankly, I have this horrible feeling that neither my sibling nor their wife have any idea of the realities of transitioning.


The idea of my no-education, minimum-wage-earning trans sister living in a small conservative town with no queer resources, no financial support from their wife, and having to walk home alone at night for an hour terrifies me. 


I feel like they're probably really nervous coming out, and I don't want to say counselling! and have them think I mean counselling to un-trans them. 


 I want my sibling to have someone to talk to who can point out that transitioning requires a lot of work and self-examination. The happiest trans people I have met have all had a lot of community support and have all seen someone to help them through it.

They fight about this among other financial issues as well. 

This man is pretty much the biggest man child you will ever meet, he's 30 and the wife to be is 23. To give more background M 30 who works as a tradie gave F 23 an ultimatum at the start of the year. Either get married, have a child or buy a house. And since she doesn't want a child right now and there's no way they can afford a house in the current Melbourne Real Estate bubble she agreed to get married. It seems like he's pressuring her to catch up with him since he's older and wants a family ect. Also keeping in mind that she lacks a lot of confidence and this is the first guy that she's ever been with. I didn't realize before but thinking about it now he seems hugely manipulative, even my girlfriend's step dad who's a CFO has offered to help them with finances but M 30 refuses to let him look at his accounts. The same pettiness goes for the wedding as well, he refuses to let anyone measure him for a suit tailor. I don't know how his fianceé can put up with this but the fiancé refuses to hear to reason and even though it's not my problem it'd be great to get some other perspective on this.

23664,Non-Romantic,3f4qro,"Alrighty, so about a year ago I was living with my best friend. We had lived together with a few other people before with no issue, so we got a place together- just us. It was fine, but I think we spent too much time together and had too close of living quarters, because the littlest things each other did started to get on the others nerves. No biggie, it happens. 

Anyway, I decide to introduce her to one of my male friends. They hit it off, start dating. This means that she isn't home as often, so her and I get space. Works out great. 

Later on down the road, she keeps asking me to hang out with her, have a girls night, catch up, whatever. I agree every time (if I don't already have plans). But when we go to actually hang out, she either has something come up with the boyfriend or she just invites him along. So I never really see her alone anymore. Which is fine, except that she says I'm being distant. I tell her the reason (that he is always around and I feel uncomfortable speaking freely about poop and sex around her bf) she dismisses it and says that I just don't want them together (even though I set them up). She doesn't see my point, I don't see hers- these things happen. This goes on for about 6 months. By that time our lease is up so I decide I don't want to renew it. This causes a huge wave and we have a falling out. 

I haven't talked to her in a few months. We have mutual friends, so I know she is still with bf and seems to be doing well. The both moved into his parents house about a month ago.

Jump to today, I was on Tinder (I know, right?) and I saw his name. He has a very unique name. The picture is a meme that he recently put up on facebook. We had quite a few mutual connections I think is the term. Basically a lot of the same facebook friends on Tinder. One of which is his cousin, whom I have no other mutual friends with- except him. I know this is him. In the description about himself he wrote Just for fun.

So I'm thinking, maybe I give him the benefit of doubt. Maybe he made an account to see what all the fuss was about? Maybe it was to mock other people who use the app? Maybe they set it up together out of curiosity? I don't know. 

But I *do* know that if I were in her shoes, I would want to know if my bf were on a dating site. I wouldn't care who told me, but I would like to be aware of that fact.

Now, she isn't the most logical person. Kind of stubborn and makes a lot of decisions out of anger- then sticks with them after the anger fades. I'm afraid that if I tell her about this, that she will shoot the messenger and say I'm trying to cause drama in their relationship. Nothing could be further from the truth, but I could imagine her saying that. 

I could tell a mutual friend, but then the issue is well why didn't she tell me herself? or how can I believe her if she won't even tell me to my face? This would be the same as if I tell him that I know about the account and to delete it or I else tell his gf. Then I am withholding information that could be detrimental. 

Otherwise, I could see them breaking up and he blames me for it. I see the logic in that as well, and I wouldn't mind it, except that we are in the same fantasy football league, so I have to see him often. I can't just avoid him. 

I don't want to be the bad guy and possibly damage their relationship/ cause drama. But I also don't want to withhold something big like that from someone I used to be close with.

23674,Non-Romantic,3cpgw8,"My brother and I have never had a close relationship. I've never posted before but I'm struggling with how to proceed with a fight that happened on Tuesday.

But first some relevant background info.

As I mentioned my brother and I have never been close. As kids we never played together and growing up he made it clear that I was a nuisance to him. Typical sibling problems from what I hear. I had one neighborhood boy who was my saving grace against the loneliness and isolation I felt from my family. In high school my mom found a raunchy note I had written to one of my girlfriends freshman year and was subsequently dragged out of the closet kicking and screaming (at the time my brother was a senior). My parents did not approve of my 'lifestyle' and from then on I backed away from my family and hardened my feelings against the rejection that I felt at home. Without going too much into it, I lost privileges such as mobile phone, band t-shirts, posters, alternative  jewelry, my bedroom door, blue jeans and shoes to name a few. My parents were very unhappy with me and withheld their affection for months at a time due to their disgust.


While all this was going on my brother was nowhere to be seen and offered no protection or support to me. When it all started I had held onto the hope that he would show up for me, but he was focused on his own thing, he was popular had beautiful girlfriends and my parents let him through regular parties at the house. I was very envious of him.


I moved out of state at twenty one, the way I saw it was I didn't really have a family life there so I wasn't missing out on much. So I left and I don't plan to ever move back. I see my parents about two or three times a year, usually meet up with them whenever they are traveling out of state. 


Over the last three years I have worked very very hard at rebuilding the relationship with my parents. Even while we were battling it out in my late teens I always did my best not to disrespect my parents. I craved their love and attention, my father is a good honorable hardworking man and my mother has always been faithful and taken good care if him (now that I'm older I don't think she's a very nice or happy person). 

After he left the house I never worried about him. He was off on his own enjoying his life, he got married owns his own home and business and seemingly is living the American dream. 


Something else worth mentioning. My brother is embarrassed of our family for some reason. He thinks he was abused and neglected by my father and he regularly says that I'm spoiled and am niave in general. At his wedding my family was placed at the far end of the room away from the bridal party. When I made a 20 hr road trip back home he would allow me to stop at his place because my cat would upset his dogs. For thanksgiving my dad and I were traveling through his town and we ate a Sonny's because he wouldn't leave his in-laws. He regularly picks fights with my dad over email and forwards them to family and friends for some reason. 



To wrap it up. I do not make much of an effort to keep in contact with him. My parents are going on a cruise and send us a picture of them eating dinner as a way to just say hi and that they were excited. I made a reply to the group message and my brother goes off the deep end about me not keeping in contact with him and also never making an effort. He proceeded to call me a coward and commented that I don't know what it's like to make my own way. I responded 

Alright Brother, here's what's up. I've been sitting back reading your messages trying to figure out how I feel about you and your little storm you decided to kick up. I'm not going to be the little sister that falls back and bows down to you There might of been a time for it but we've missed that window. Calling me spoiled and a coward only shows me that my hesitation is justified. I don't trust you. The way you treat our parents is embarrassing. I isolated myself from the family, but I did that for me. You do it because you're ashamed.


Since that I haven't heard anything from him. I think I hurt his feelings. I really don't wish anything bad for my brother, I want him to be happy in his marriage and have a better relationship with our parents (something I know he must want). My problem is when he reaches out I don't have any pull to keep in contact with him. It's not easy to hurt my feelings anymore, I've learned to take a very cold approach to relationship conflict, something he doesn't realize and a habit I'm not ready to break.

I guess I don't know what to do or say to him. My parents will be getting back this weekend and I'm hoping to have done something to minimize the conflict before my mother hears about it. And also for his wife, I don't like that shes having to see this side of him or me.

I really don't want to call him anytime soon.. Maybe that's just me being immature. I'm really not feeling very nice right now, but I don't want to hurt him anymore. 

How do I explain to him that him? I'm not sure what I'm really expecting, I think I just needed to write it out. Thought comments and opinions are welcome.

We come from a very loving household of happily married parents and two older siblings, (M/23) and (F/21), who now live on their own.

My younger sister has had anxiety for several months now, possibly longer. 
It has been mentioned that I, being an older sister who has good grades, many leadership positions, and hold a big weight at our school, am a cause of some if her anxiety. I am not boastful and no one expects her to become the same student as me. However, she feels as if she is living in my shadow.
She is wildly talented and so beautiful, so it breaks my heart to hear this.

Months ago, it was to the point where she would run off crying if I had her gentle instruction. Now, after seeing professional help, she has become stronger, yet will still have attacks.

She currently seems stuck in this mindset that it will take years for her to get better, she needs continuous professional help, and can not escape her anxiety. 

I tried to explain to her that I used to have many issues with my anxiety, but decided that I did not want to submit to it anymore, and matured out of it.

But she won't listen. She's stuck. She lets unfortunate instances consume her entire day.
We are very supportive of her, but want her to get off of therapy (primarily because we would like to her use the tools she has been given to make strides in her own, and also it's a financial burden on our family).

I apologize for the length of that message, but I tears my heart to see her so feeble and I wanted to give you proper perspective.

Although i acknowledge that anxiety is a serious issue, I have always thought of anxiety like this as rut in the road; something people grow out of and move in from. It seems to be so much more common nowadays, and although I hate to admit it, much like fad. I have of course never told my sister this, but I was wondering if anyone else had thoughts regarding this and how to handle it.

But above all else, I want her to get better.

(Ex: When I was struggling in class, my parents almost made me change my major to Education; they went to talk to the parents of a previous boyfriend and when discovering he came from a non well-to-do household, accused him of dating me only for money and sex.)  
  
  
Alright. 
I (20 F) am college student that graduated two years ago and, my younger brother graduated high school today. When my parents watched me walk, they came late and couldn't find seats and had to watch from far away. Today, my dad and I were in Houston Chinatown running errands all day (dentist appointment, shopping, etc) and my mom was just relaxing at home doing some gardening. My brother left for the practice ceremony at around 5pm, and my dad and I got back from Chinatown around that time as well. However, my parents made the conscious decision to not go to the graduation ceremony this year. We left the home at around 8:30 pm and stopped by Kroger to pick up some balloons, and then got to the graduation stadium around 9 pm. By the time the car pulled up, graduation was over and people were already filing out of the place left, right, and center.  
  
Long story short, my brother was livid. He said he had been looking for my parents all graduation, that this was one day out of 4 years of high school, and they couldn't even spare that much. The car ride home was silent besides him berating my parents and my dad giving weak excuses about how he mismanaged his time (he didn't mismanage the time, he had 3 or 4 hours of free time before they left home). No pictures were taken, and my brother said he was going to burn his robes because he doesn't want to remember a graduation where no one from his family was there to see him walk. When we pulled into our driveway, he said asked for his medals back to throw away (he graduated with full honors), saying give them back. I don't want them and you don't deserve them.
  
When he came home, he shuffled around the kitchen's knife drawer. He is currently on the computer, not wanting/ accepting the graduation presents from his parents or me. He has attempted suicide a year ago, it is possible he would do something to harm himself again, though there isn't a way I can verify that. My parents probably feel horribly guilty as well, but are too prideful to apologise. And I'm here in the middle, typing out an Ask-Reddit really late at night, desperate for some advice. What advice do I give my parents? How will I talk to my brother again (who has now been ignoring me since)? What can I do to help patch this situation up? Please help me. I don't know what to do or who else to ask.

I know I am also to blame in this, more comments reminding me that is not necessary, I already feel like shit, nothing more you guys could say that could make me feel worse. Advice on how to proceed from here would be appreciated though. Just trying to focus on being better in the future. My brother and I don't traditionally talk a lot.

Meg promised never to put me through the things Amanda did, but she ended up cheating on me with Chloe too! This obviously brought up a lot of really painful memories from the emotionally abusive relationship with Amanda. I felt a lot of betrayal. I broke up with Meg and cut contact with her. I've moved on with my life (this was all years ago) but still see Meg on rare occasions because we have mutual friends. I just try to avoid talking to her because I have enough friends in my life and don't feel any need to have ex's as friends, especially since I have grown and changed a lot since high school and feel I have nothing in common with Meg any more. Meg is now in a long term relationship with someone if that's relevant.

I don't want to say that she is in my thoughts or I hope she's doing okay. I was going to say something about it being sad to hear but I don't feel sad, I barely remember her Dad. I guess I could say it anyway but it wouldn't be genuine. I know I am being weird about this. It is obviously not about me and it's a sad time for her but I still want to choose my words wisely. What do you think I should say? Agh. I am overthinking this. Any advice would be appreciated.

23713,Non-Romantic,2h1798,"Preliminary information: my family and my niece, Sabrina's family are not super close, mainly due to religion and the fact we no longer speak to my parents (Sabrina's grandparents) due to this as well (religion, their physical abuse, etc) and Sabrina's family still have a relationship with them. My family (me, spouse and kids) are quite liberal and though we belong to a church and are moderately religious, we are not super vocal about it. Sabrina's, family (Sabrina, her sibs, and parents) are very religious, in a weird way (I.e., don't believe in dinosaurs etc.) and very judgmental and right wing toward the world. However, I keep up on Cathy and Sabrina's lives through Facebook.

Sabrina and her mom, Cathy, like to vague-book in general - I.e., asking for prayers on Facebook but not saying why, partial statuses that just leave one guessing, etc. Sabrina's statuses have been getting weird lately and she seems pretty emo, though still religious. A few days ago, Cathy posted a plea for prayer with no explanation, only a photo of Sabrina. Of course the prayer soldiers (all the super religious people they know) were right on it. Instead of publicly posting anything, I messaged her asking for details, to which she never responded. Then later she posts some info on her status like Sabrina is in icu in a coma. Please give us privacy. 

Wtf. Do you want attention or privacy? At this point I am floored and of course my suspicions are building on what may have happened to cause Sabrina to go into a coma. I suspect Sabrina attempted suicide because I can't think of anything else it would be that Cathy wouldn't say.

Since this happened, Cathy has been posting updates including photos of Sabrina unconscious in the hospital, but still no details on why she ended up there. I think it is incredibly weird to do this stuff on Facebook.  Am I wrong to believe this is attention seeking behavior on Cathy's part? Knowing her, I think she's loving the attention. But the human and parent in me of course feels bad about the situation Sabrina is in and I want to know what happened; however, I will not take part in this public strangeness.

2) do you think Cathy will ever say this publicly?

23719,Non-Romantic,2xcd8b,"Ok, so I'll do my best to be clear and coherent but this is a pretty worrisome situation for me so apologies if I'm muddled.

I'm a first year [UK] University student  and now is the time when we have to look at where we're living next year. I ended up agreeing to live with my best friend and another close friend [also 19F]

We'd been looking at places as a three for maybe a month or so with little progress (we did find a really nice place but the agent messed us about).

So last week one of my other closest friends [19M] returned to the city after a month at home because of personal tragedy. I really like this guy and he's going through some really tough times, but his best mate [another 19M] is insufferable. I've had real problems with him in the past (especially when he's in a group of males) but he seems to quite like me. 

My best friend somehow invited those two to live with us without consulting myself or our other flatmate first. She's been going through some real problems too, so I don't want to start another one for her, but the thought of living with the two of them as well is something I'm really not comfortable with.

Our other original flatmate was uncomfortable at first but now is acting like it's fine (though she would prefer a three), meaning that I'm the problem stopping the 5 of us living together. 

They've already viewed some flats together (which were, apparently, appaling) but I really don't think I can be a part of it - the two guys keep mentioning the roommate thing and it makes me sick thinking about it.

When we were first planning living together there was another girl I wanted to invite, because she didn't really have anyone to live with and I liked her a lot, but my two other roommates said they weren't comfortable with her so I let it drop (she's fine now though).

When I told my best friend yesterday she said she needed time to think about it and we changed the subject for the rest of the night, but she's going away for the weekend and every day this goes on it gets worse I think.

My best friend has said that not living with me is not an option so I think if I really force the issue she'll go back to the three of us, but I'm not sure how to deal with the situation - I'm at risk of losing my close male friend because there's no way he'd abandon his mate. We all (except for the mate) live in one big hall at the moment so him not being my friend would be really hard.

I was due to live with the two guys (and some other lads) earlier as well but I left them (mainly due to the mate) and joined the plans of the two girls

What do I do? What do I say?

**TL;DR: Best Friend is trying to include guy I don't like in our house plans, I'm not comfortable, but I don't want to ruin it with his best friend.**

I need to speak to my male friend tonight and tell him that I'm not comfortable living with his mate.

23738,Non-Romantic,3bfjuj,"**Throwaway because one user (not the one I talk about here)  actively stalks my main account and also knows this person.** 

Just for the record, me and this guy **are not** in a relationship and throughout the 9 months we've known each other we have not been in a relationship with each other.

We met about 9 months ago on (he was 19 at the time) on another subreddit that we both use quite frequently, I had recently just been rejected by someone that I had liked and posted about it in this subreddit. He was one of the very supportive people that helped me out a little bit. Anyways, we talked for a bit in the thread, we found some common ground and before you know it we're talking on skype about a week later. 

The second time we ever talked through voice on Skype he confessed to me saying that he liked me. Me, having just been rejected and not knowing this guy all too well said no. 

But again, that was 9 months ago, he and I have actually gotten to know each other really really well. I've helped him through some rough times in his life and he's helped me out a little bit too. We have lots in common, and we talk pretty much everyday now. 

However, he never quite got over his little crush on me. As time has gone by, his feelings for me have only grown more intense and now its gotten to the point where he pretty much says I love you every single day. 

I don't necessarily have a problem with this, and I think its because I'm not necessarily sure about my feelings for him myself. I know him very well, but I haven't met him in person yet. And that's sort of when I want to make my mind up about it. But that won't be for at least another 18 months. 

He is genuinely a good person, he's willing to go above and beyond the call of duty for his friends, he really cares about other people and he's passionate about the things he does. He's also treated me better than any other man I've met in the world and I really care about him too. 

But even if I was in a relationship with him, I don't ever feel like he could be the number 1 thing in my life like he says I am to him. I don't like letting myself get too close to people, its caused me too much hurt. 

He's said that I'm probably the last girl that he's going to fall for and that I'm the perfect one for him, and if that's true, than if we never get together he's going to be really hurt and he's already had to deal with a lot in his life. 

A couple months ago he tried to fly up to see me, but was stopped at the border because ya know, he's 20 and I'm 16 and my parents weren't having any of it. If we got together in a few years, they would never approve and it would probably cause a bit of unrest in my family if he turned out to be the one

I could see us in a really good happy relationship, but the thing is I couldn't see myself staying. I might leave him for someone, or leave because relationships just don't do it for me. 

I should also probably mention that I have never been in a relationship with anyone before and I am a virgin. 

Its more of a minor thing, but he has had girlfriends before and is not a virgin and I've never told him this but it kind of intimidates me a bit as well. Like every time he mentions one of his exes it just irks me. And every time I'm reminded he's not a virgin it just bothers me. I know that one of his exes is going to have better assets than me in some way or another, I just know that he'd probably have enjoyed sex with them better than me and it just hurts. 

The funny thing is, this has never happened to me before, I know its something I'll just have to get over if we ever end up dating. But everyone else whom I've liked I didn't care if they were a virgin or not, had girlfriends/boyfriends before or not. (I'm bi, always preferred women) I'm not sure why it irks me now. 

I think this is just because I've never had a boyfriend/girlfriend before and the fact that I'm still a virgin, so its all completely new territory to me. I don't know though. 

I don't want to lock myself down onto one person (him) I've still got a couple years in my teens left, but I honestly don't see anyone else willing to date me in my local area. 

I really care about him, he's a great friend to me, I just have no idea what to do at this point. 

I just kind of went off with all of this at once so if something is unclear or you have any questions please ask.

23743,Non-Romantic,22u7hw,"Back when I was studying, I had two ban accounts. One was for my main income and everyday banking. The other one I set up specifically to receive my monthly study stipend. Where I am from, the government pays a monthly amount to students and if you finish your studies successfully, it becomes a gift. If you don't finish successfully or not within the set time frame, it becomes a loan.

I put my dad's name on the account and gave him full rights to help me manage it. I was living abroad and travelling a lot so it made sense to have someone at home who could go to the bank and check on the account. Back then, I had a good relation with my dad.

Fast forward to when I finish my studies. I am back in my native country and negotiating with the organisation that paid my study money. They are notorious for having a bad administration I.e. I had to prove multiple times I actually studied (never mind my diploma's) and it was not uncommon for them to state I had to pay everything back. A lot of my friends were in the same boat, it was part of the reason I have my dad access to the account. After the negotiation, I ended up having to pay them back some of the money. I had left the money on my student money account and hadn't touched it in a long time.

When I logged in, all the money was gone. I could see my dad transferred it all away to his own (and even my sister's) bank account. We're talking thousands here, and none of it was his or ever belonged to him (he never paid anything into the account).

When I talked to him, he danced around the subject. He stayed really vague, like:oh, that money? I took it because it was just sitting there etc. 
He did not acknowledge when I asked him where it went or if I could have it back. 
When I told him I needed the money because some of it needed to be paid back, he basically told me not to worry and they won't send the bailiff any time soon.

I have tried several timed to talk to him over the past two weeks, but now he seems to be ignoring me. I am never confrontational or rude to him, I just said I would feel a lot better having the money back, and that if he felt I still owed him money for whatever, I would gladly set up a monthly payment once I have the money back.

23747,Non-Romantic,1q1no1,"The guy I'm dating (John) adopted a dog about 2 months ago. It was obvious it wasn't very well taken care of. The dog is only two, but already has some pretty bad problems with his knees and hips. Those are problem areas for this particular breed, but his knees especially seem like they are more damaged than normal. Looking up his symptoms online, it really seems to me he has a cranial cruciate ligament injury, which is basically the canine ACL.

*An ACL injury is extremely painful and affected dogs experience pain while simply walking. A tear or rupture leads to joint swelling, pain and instability in the knee joint. If left untreated it will cause lameness in the affected rear leg and, ultimately, chronic irreversible degenerative joint changes. Damage to the ACL is a major cause of progressive osteoarthritis in the knee joint of dogs. The good news is that there is a high success rate with surgeries performed to repair ACL injuries and that dogs who receive surgical treatment can resume regular activities after rehabilitation.* 





We have both looked this info online, so he understands what's probably going on here. Most of the treatment options are expensive, which is why I think he hasn't brought him back to the vet. I have a feeling if left to his own devices, he won't bring the dog in until it's hurt so bad (like not walking or whimpering all the time), he has to go in. 

This is driving me crazy. I never understand people who buy or adopt animals and then resent it when it costs money. That's part of the deal. Though John isn't rolling in extra dough, he just got a promotion at work and is looking at a $5,000+ motorcycle to buy. Early intervention is important. If he's worried about money, he should bring him in early before it's more expensive to fix or irreversible. I tell him when I notice the dog is whimpering or holding a leg up and have asked when he's going back to the vet, but he's brushing it off. I've spent as much, if not more, time with this dog and I care a lot about it. I'm at the point where I am willing to bring the dog in and pay for the appointment and any x-rays etc myself. We just need to know what's going on here, for fuck's sake. 

How should I go about getting this issue solved? HE is the one who adopted the dog and he CAN afford it. If John doesn't want to pay for it, I really don't think he should have the dog at all. But this isn't the dog's fault and if I have to pay to get him into the vet sooner, I will.

I first met Michael in high school of my junior year. We were in a sport together and eventually we became friends when we started to hang out more. So I joined his group of friends and it was great because this was my first time I would say I had a real set of friends. I was able to join the group and they accepted me and we all became close. When we hung out I was introduce to his girlfriend Sally of which they been together for 2 years. We became closer and I saw her as much a friend as the others instead of just my buddy's girlfriend. I would consider both Michael and Sally to be my best friends cause I could talk to them about anything from personal problems, religion, politics, and in general anything. I would tell them my problems and they tell me theirs. They were the 2 people I could hold conversations with easiest and be most honest with. The problem with the recent break up is I don't know if I could still be friends with Sally anymore. It was a mutuel breakup so no bad blood but I don't think it would be possible for the group to hangout with sally without getting awkward. For context their relationship started with Sally joining the group a year before micahel and her got together so she was at first a member of the group and then a year later she and  Michael got together so I don't know if this changes the dynamic. Also sally does have her own set of friends so its not like we are her only friends and she can't hangout with anyone else (although most of her friends either are always busy with work, live further, or are constantly doing drugs of which she doesn't like). So what will happen? Will I lose Sally as a friend or is it possible for our group to remain the same despite the breakup?

here's the issue: All the adults except me went downtown Yesterday.  


For a while I've been asking her to go to this specific restaurant but we haven't been able to.  Well, while she was gone I jumped on the computer to look up something for the kids and her email was open.  In it there was a message from her sister requesting they go to this place.  My wife makes a mention that I would be mad if they went, but doesn't outright say no.  Following that, lots of joking about how they will lie to me and just say they went somewhere else.


This bugged me but they ended up not going there. She made no mention of the restaurant though, just said they went to Y place for lunch.  I did get upset a bit yesterday bc it was supposed to be a girls outing but I found out later everyone went but me.


However , today in talking with the BIL I discover the joking was no joke - they actually went to place 1 first, and only did not go bc it was closed.


Naturally I get a little upset. Wife keeps asking what's wrong , I keep trying to push it to later but she persists. Finally, I tell her and she gets mad at me! Tells me she didn't want to go there.  That I'm being ridiculous. Meanwhile I know she made no mention of it to me at all.


well, whatever. I had to go get some food for the kids, and here's the kicker -as soon as I'm gone and out of earshot, her sister comes back and I see my wife through the window aping my eexpressions and basically telling her what I just said - before we were able to resolve the issue.   this made me very embarrassed, So I took off, after texting her to enjoy her conversation.

23789,Non-Romantic,326f0m,"Hi all, I want to start by saying that I am madly in love with my fiance.  She is amazing and is absolutely the love of my life, and the chemistry we have is simply incredible.  I'm sorry if this a bit of a ramble and I will try to keep it as clear and concise as possible.

That being said, there is an issue with her interacting with my family that has been driving a wedge in between us.  My fiance is incredibly shy, and she comes from a very small family.  She is an only child, and outside of her parents, she has 5 living relatives.

My family is Polish on the one side, and Italian on the other, and by her standards is huge (although in my opinion we are probably more moderately sized).  When we first started dating a few years ago, she would come to our family events and have no problem (birthday bashes, thanksgiving, etc.).  We are a pretty laid back bunch, and usually our get-togethers consist of finger-foods and people relaxing with wine and just catching up, usually with about 10-15 people depending on who can make it.

Last July however, she was hit with a tick-born disease (the doctors could never specify if it was Lyme disease or something else, but they were certain it was tick-born). This absolutely wrecked her, and we basically put off all wedding planning until earlier this year.  By early 2015, she was still having the occasional bad day, but by and large was was having more good days than bad.

Where the issue with my family comes in is that whatever happened to her last summer, it seems to have magnified her shyness and social anxiety 500 times.  We discussed our wedding over the course of December-February, and finally decided to move forward with the wedding this coming September (though I still wondered aloud if we should put it off to 2016).

Then came the problem; my family is absolutely thrilled that we are engaged, and naturally wants to celebrate.  My fiance has said to me many times that she likes all my family members individually, but can't handle us when we are all together.  I do not force her to come to most gatherings; she has been absent the last Thanksgiving, Christmas, my birthday party, etc., because she is simply terrified of my family.

For our wedding, we decided on a small elopement package, and then to have a more formal party at a nice restaurant when we get back, but I was insistent that our parents join us.  My mother would have been simply devastated had she not been able to be there for the ceremony, and after all the love and support my parents have given me throughout my life, I felt leaving them out would have been unacceptable.

This led to many tear-filled debates and arguments.  In the end I got my way and my parents (and her parents) were allowed to come to our wedding.

For the record, getting her to agree to have a party afterwards was also a slogging debate.

A few days ago, my sister told us that she wants to throw us a couples-shower (she wanted to do a bridal shower but figured my fiance would say no, which she was right about).  This led to another tear-filled debate last night and my fiance told me that by making me interact with my family so much that I was forcing her to be someone that she is not.

I have told her over and over again that we are only going to get married once, and that the people most important in my life simply want to share that moment with us.  I've asked her to try and tough it out for the wedding, and that in the future I won't ask her to come to any family gatherings unless she truly wants to.

She usually breaks into tears and tells me how much she doesn't want to let me down but that this just isn't her and that making her do all these things is too much.

To round it up, I simply don't know how to approach these issues, and I am getting worn down by all the arguments over things like a wedding shower and whether or not my parents should be at our wedding.  99% of the time this would not be an issue, but I do not want to cut the most important people in my life out of the most important event of my life.

Does anyone have any advice for working through these kinds of issues with someone who has very bad social anxiety and extreme shyness?  It would be much appreciated.  Also, in case any of you ask, we are scheduled to meet with a counselor before we get married.

23797,Non-Romantic,39n2su,"I feel like this story needs a little background... My fiance, we'll call him Charlie, was raised by just his mother (we'll call her Rose). When Charlie was a kid he only saw his dad (Arthur) a little bit, once in a while they would spend a weekend together but they ended up losing touch and didn't talk again until about a month ago. 


Arthur and Charlie have found out that they have a lot in common, and one of those things is that they're both stoners. Arthur doesn't care because Charlie is an adult, but needless to say they've talked about smoking through Facebook. But for the most part, they're just talking and getting to know each other again after years of not seeing or hearing from each other.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Rose got onto her laptop a few days ago and read all of the messages between them (we know she had to dig through the messages, the last message was innocent, just asking how we were and if we wanted to come visit). Then, she decided to send Arthur some messages from Charlie's account. She told him he's disgusting for wanting to do drugs with Charlie, and she claims that Arthur is trying to lure him into being friends. She told Arthur it would be a cold day in hell before she **let** her son do drugs with him. Rose also told Arthur that we said we didn't want him to attend our wedding (which is a lie - we'd both love to have him there). 


My fiance sent a text to his mother telling her she had no right to look at his private messages, let alone send messages to his father, and she basically gave him the same speech. Charlie tried reasoning with her but she told him You're an adult and can do what you want, but I don't approve of it. And now she's ignoring him. Rose has told Arthur that she has his phone number and address (which she got from one of their private messages), and she says she'll contact the authorities if he tries contacting Charlie again.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



We really want to have Arthur at the wedding, but Rose is threatening him with the authorities. Is there a way we can guarantee his safety if he does come to the wedding? And is there action that we can take against his mother for this invasion of privacy (we aren't planning on actually pressing charges or anything, but she doesn't have to know that. We'd like to tell her how wrong her actions were and how much trouble she could be in.) ?



**TL;DR** 
My fiance left his Facebook logged in on his mother's laptop. She read messages between him and his father about smoking marijuana (and sent messages through my fiance's Facebook). Now she's threatening his father, saying that if he tries to contact my fiance again she'll call the authorities.

23799,Non-Romantic,28l1iq,"I really don't know where to start so I will try to put this together as good as I possibly can. I do apologize for the wall of text.

**Background**: My mother and I (Asians) have always had a very emotionally distant relationship. She married early (16 y/o) and I'm not even sure if she willingly married my father (who is 7 yrs older). I was told that my father was very physically abusive towards my mother. After having 3 kids, she got pregnant again. She didn't want another child and panicked. My mother chose to have an abortion, but she was quickly stopped by my grandmother. She later found out that she was expecting twins, which was even worse for her. She cried. I am the younger one (or so they say) and to this day, I still feel like I wasn't supposed to exist at all. My mother barely took care of me. Another family did. At the age of 4, I and my family, excluding my father, moved from Asia to Europe.

I don't have any deep connection with any of my siblings, especially K, due to our differences. My mother never was emotional with us. Not once in my life have I heard her say that she loves me. When she went shopping for things with my uncle, K always wanted to come along. I wanted too, but they didn't have enough space in the car, so I stayed home. Since we moved to another country, I learned to speak its language much better than the asian one, which of course caused a bit of a language barrier between my mother and I. My father finally moved to live with us when I was about 10.

**The issue**: I have always felt unwanted and less loved than my siblings. I tend to hear from relatives how much more K is loved by our mother and that I was a stupid child for being nice and easy-going. I can't ask her for advice or tell her about my life. In my family, it is very common to humiliate each other and point out flaws. She hasn't teached me anything. Not cleaning, cooking nor any household stuff. Yet, she complains that I can't do ANYTHING. When I try to help her or am told to do something, there's always something that I do wrong. Too slow, not the right way. Sometimes, I end up crying in front of her and asks her why a mother is behaving like she does. She only stared at me.

Ever since my father moved in with us, my mother has a tendency to start arguments with him, even insulting him right in front of her children. The fights have become more frequent and my father is starting to yell back more often now. Whenever I or K try to tell her to please stop, she gets extremely defensive and starts throwing insults as well as guilt tripping us. They still live together despite being divorced.

My mother also has a thing for other people's children. She puts more effort into caring for her nieces and nephews than her own kids. One time when I was 17, she told me to go buy some ingredients for her (she was going to cook for my 6 y/o cousin). I came back, apparently with the wrong stuff and was yelled at and forced to go back again. I got it wrong twice since she didn't know the brand. She was enraged, started yelling and insulting me. I couldn't deal with it so I packed my stuff and went to my friends' houses. I was away for 6 days.

When I told her about my boyfriend (23 y/o), who is dark skinned, she laughed at first and tried to make me leave him by saying really racist things, but when she realized that I wasn't going to break up with him, she cried. I've only had two emotional conversations with her throughout my whole life. This and one before. When I asked her if she would allow me to be with a person of my choice and she said 'yes, I want you to be happy'.

Now that I have started my summer job, she is acting nicer towards me. Asking me about work related things (and of course, the amount of money I'll get), making my bed, bought more food for me and so on. She had asked me if I wanted to buy her a train ticket to go see my older sister (32 y/o). She had spent the same amount of money for a toy that she had bought for my 6 y/o cousin. Also, she doesn't work, my older brother (30 y/o) is the provider of this family...

I feel that I don't want to have much contact with my mother when I have moved out. My older brother (24 y/o) had moved to another city. He rarely calls or visits her/us. I can see that it makes her sad.

**Is it disrespectful of me to do that?** After all, she has looked after me and let me have a home. She plans to have us give her money to live on when all of us have moved out and started working.

**How do I cope with her behavior?** Reasoning with her has no effect. Moving out is impossible as I'm still attending high school and have no job. I'd be very grateful for some advice and feel free to ask me any questions!

Danni has always been a free spirit and has recently kind of become a hippie. Sweet! I have no problems with her beliefs or anything. The issue is that she doesn't shower anymore. Like, ever. She boasts about the fact that she hasn't showered in over 6 months, and honestly she smells disgusting. She's a big girl and she is super sweaty. She doesn't have a car and rides her bike everywhere. Where we live 100 degree temps are not uncommon, so everybody sweats! But everybody else showers. I'm open minded, but the last time she hugged me, I literally gagged. She knows she smells like rotten BO but she doesn't care, and laughs it off like it's a hilarious joke or prank to hug people with her nasty smell. We were out of town at a friend's wedding and I had to sneak away to my hotel room to change dresses because when she saw me and hugged me, my dress smelled awful! My husband came out from the bar and hugged me afterwards and told me I reeked of BO.

What should I say to her? Should I say anything to her? She already knows she stinks, and I don't want her to think I don't like her anymore, but sometimes being around her (especially if we are in close quarters) makes me nauseous! Anybody have any ideas?

23852,Non-Romantic,1t4nb5,"Hi. I don't know if this is the right subreddit, but here goes:



Almost two years ago I dropped out of high school and took the GED. My parents were incredibly disappointed, but I convinced them to let me do it because I was bullied a lot at high school and had attempted to kill myself before (preteen angst, not an issue anymore). I figured I could just enroll in community college, study whatever and live a nice uneventful life and my parents would help me go through with that... but then we moved. For whatever reason, my parents decided to pick up and go to live in a middle-of-nowhere house that is a half hour drive from anything and I, stupidly, went with them. Now it's been over a year since I've left or seen anyone else.



I don't have a car; I have maybe two-hundred dollars in the bank; and my parents never leave except to take my little brother to school and to go out to the occasional dinner. So here I've been, sitting at home for a year, because my parents won't let me leave.



You might ask why--why won't my parents let me move out? Well, they won't help me leave unless I get accepted to a top-tier college. They think that if I just sit at home and apply myself, I can get into Harvard and go become a doctor. I have not expressed interest in this and am not smart enough to do it even if I tried, but it is apparently my only option.



I've tried to reason with them. I've given them the this isn't what I want speech and the you can't just trap me here tantrum. After months of sitting home alone I even went and got myself committed to a psychiatric ward so that I'd just have someone to talk to that didn't infuriate me.



Once I got into the psych ward, the doctors realized I wasn't actually what I had pretended to be and they tried to help me through it. For two weeks, my family and I went to counseling and tried to mediate our differences, but lo and behold once the required two weeks had passed, they just went back to their old mantra: study hard and get into a good college.



Maybe that's what I should do, maybe I should just try my best and follow what my parents want, but it's so hard to study when I'm so depressed. I haven't talked to anyone since the psych ward and even prison seems preferable right now (I've told my parents all this, but after the psych ward they are even less inclined to listen to anything I have to say because now I'm crazy and not fit to go out in public). And also, I don't know if they even would let me leave if I did. 



Its not that my home-life is bad--my parents give me anything that I ask for as long as it doesn't involve leaving. (Actually, I've begun to consider the fact that they don't even care about college, they just want me to stay with them) But either way, I'm too scared to do what I've considered a few times, which is just to hitchhike my way out of there and try and make it (did I mention that all my money is in an account controlled by parents?)



I am actually very attractive (it's part of the reason why I was bullied and alienated at school) and I know I could make it in some sort of indecent career if I really needed the money. It's just, I feel torn between my above-average lonesome life and a potential poverty-stricken future. Being at home is okay when I don't think about the loneliness. I don't have a friend in the world to talk to this about and my parents refuse to listen. I guess I just want some advice.

In short, my family seems to be in terrible shape.   
First of all my family is PLAGUED with mental health issues. Both my parents appear to have Bipolar and Severe depression. I also suspect my Mother has narcissistic traits.   
My middle sister (19) has Borderline Personality Disorder. This became evident when, around four years ago, she was BRUTALLY assaulted. She is very lucky to be alive, but has been very ill since then. She's attempted suicide 5 or 6 times, which my parents refuse to acknowledge. Or my Mother tells her to forget about it.   
She's moved into her own Apartment now, has a steady job, and has been in a relationship for 3 years, which the rest of my family, again, refuses to acknowledge.   
My middle sister is.. odd. She's very well behaved at 12 years old, but I almost never see her eating. She's detached from the rest of the family and as far as I know, has no friends. She seems to have no real interest in boys and when she was younger, said very often that she wished to be a boy. I asked my parents to comply with her wishes but they did not, and now she's started getting into more 'feminine' things, though that could be just to appease my parents, I don't know.  
Like myself she has dyslexia. Once again this is utterly ignored by the rest of my family. They accuse me of thinking she's 'dumb.'   
She isn't. She just needs extra help, that's all.   
My mother spends most of her time drinking or asleep. My Father is so depressed he just sits around, staring. He'll engage with me, though, if I try.   
I was admitted to a mental facility a year ago after I attempted suicide. I'm okay now, but I'm finding it increasingly difficult to cope with all of my family's problems, my mental illness, and my depression.  
My Mother goes to visit a therapist but I know he tells her what she wants to hear, and I'm not sure what she's told him, or how much she's left out.

I'm having an issue at work. I need help articulating my concerns and what I want from my manager. 

Backstory- Up until a few years ago myself and co-worker Jay(we are the only two in this office) were  both working 4-day work weeks and all was well. My boss came to me and said that we were just getting too busy and that I would need to go back to 5 days per week. Jess will stay at 4 and use Friday as an outside sales day. First off I was kind of pissed since I have been with the company longer(by 5 years), but since he started out as an outside sales person only and I figured that once we got back to the slow season I would get to go back, so I didn't speak up about it. 
Well, 2 years later I'm still 5 days per week and Jay still has Fridays off. 

2 things that really piss me off is:

1- If Jay is taking a vacation, he gets the previous Friday, Monday-Friday and is only using 4 days vacation. Note the vacation time is only 8 hrs per day, so he only gets paid 32hrs for that week but gets 6 full days off. If I take a week off I have to use 5 full days and only get 5 days. I do not get the option of only using 4 days and taking 1 day with out pay. See how the math isn't adding up?? 

2- When I do take vacation my boss makes Jess work on Friday so he isn't the only one there. This week my boss was on vacation and guess what? Jay still had Friday off and I was alone all day with the exception of someone from another dept. coming to cover my lunch. 

This is just a few of the many problems and I need to send an email to my boss and ask for either, my 4-day work week back or have Jay start working 5 days again. I just have a problem sorting out exactly what I want to say.

LONG ASS BACKSTORY



My mother Terry was raped when she was younger and that led to her acting out promiscuously and through drugs, which put her at ends with my grandma Roberta [71F]. She claims emotional and physical abuse after Roberta failed to remain married to gramps and understand what she was going through. After my family was in an intense car crash, my mother slipped in depression and possibly drugs as my step father Paul [48M] definitely did drugs and they got into physical altercations regularly that resulted in police visits. Grams intervened, called CPS and my two sisters Jane [16F] and Laurie [19F] and I went to a children's shelter until we were released  to Grams care. 

3 years later and Terry regains custody over us, but not of her family dynamics. She is emotionally and physically abusive and loses custody again. We are returned again. She blames us for her failing marriage, but of course she denies this claim, even though what six grader forgets that type of stuff. Paul continued to cheat and use drugs until last year when she kicked him out, for the millionth time. She still considers herself happily married of 25 years.

Oh, and she has chronic back pain that leads her to use morphine and norco and other DEA monitored controlled substances. She doubles up on pain pills and complains that the doctors just think she's an addict and the pain isn't real, but it's unbearable etc. She sometimes buys them off the street.
She's on disability and housing aid. She's awake until 3am every day watching the same DVDS because we can't afford cable or wifi. She sleeps until 4pm and watches movies. She is a hoarder of items when she volunteers at a church pantry. Our garage is filled with useless items. 

She commits fraud with me and my sisters names, misspelling a letter here, or a wrong social number because she defaults on everything. Mail just accumulates in a corner.

My credit is pretty bad.

I was always nerdy having taken on a motherly role for my sisters. I failed them. They dabbled in drinking, drugs and tattoos, living the thug life. Laurie had a baby at 18 and has no job, lives with her boyfriend and is a pot head. She lives with her boyfriend and his family, and is given an house-wife allowance by him. They are relatively stable, they get into physical fights sometimes which I despise. They've been together 5 years and are of same age.

Jane had a baby at 16 by a male of 22 years. THAT'S OLDER THAN ME, AND ALTHOUGH I WANTED TO FILE RAPE CHARGES, SHE AND HER MOTHER REFUSED. 
She is crazy. We started calling the police for aid when she was 14 when she threatened to kill my mother in her sleep, threatened to kill herself, threatened to kill me and Laurie. She has called the police on Laurie for domestic fights and we have called the police on her for her generally beating us. She has 60lbs on me.  
She is in no medicine and hasn't been to therapy since we were in foster care.

THE INCIDENT
I get a call as I pull into our neighborhood that her boyfriend had tried to run her over with his car after she started acting all dramatic because he was talking to her some girl and wanting to be a father to her baby. Yeah, he has another baby and supports none of them, lives in the county and works at Walmart.
She breaks his windshield, he leaves and she's crying to let me let her take car so she can go over to his dad's house and pay for the windshield. Bigger surprise, she's fucking drunk but has stopped breast feeding a week ago for supply issues not related to crazy. 

I tell her no, and to look at me so we can have a normal conversation because she's slurring to her reflection, fixing her hair and watching herself cry.

I go to the living room and she demands the car. It's a car that was gifted to me by my grandfathers and I hold the title. It was my responsibility to use it to help my family, but this isn't the intended use. She threatens to kill him and me and then herself because just wants to make things work her little family. I break and tell her to go ahead and kill herself. How dare she claim to love her daughter when she's threatening to kill those around her and herself. 
She snaps and attacks me. Druggie elderly mom gets in the middle, I call the police, she starts with the I won't call them, I'm going to get her baby taken away, she's going to get me and my mom arrested, cussing me out then claiming that we are abusing her while I'm on the phone. 
They hang up and she's saying she'll calm down, let her up, she just wants to leave and stupid ass Terry relents. Of course I'm telling her not to listen to her, she can't be trusted, think about the consequences she needs help etc. but alas she runs and grabs her newborn, she has no shoes and wants to ditch the cops who are on the way. She starts slapping and hitting me and Terry with the baby in her arms.
The cops come as she's screaming down our neighborhood that were ruining her life.

Terry hides the beer bottles, the drugs and tells half truths. Idgaf and tell them the truth. 
Right now she's at Grams who is more than aware of the cycle.

I'm done.


 I've wanted to kill myself since I was in 1st grade. I would spend hours cleaning my closet crying  I want to die, I want to die. In sixth grade I wrote my first suicide note, which Terry found under my mattress, and called me dramatic.
I started cutting in eighth grade, and have since stopped, but the thoughts are still here and there. 



With the exception of moving out of state, I've lived with long term boyfriends, ( 2 in the past 4 years ). Right now I'm at home since my last relationship ended, but I can't do this anymore. They are on my phone bill and I pay $300 a month, thanks T-Mobile. Mine is $100, everyone else's is $65 a month, plus account access which is $110. Laurie doesn't pay anything because she is never reachable at the due time, Terry and Jane pay their $65 sometimes, but no ones pays the account but me. 
I'm in community college and I work two jobs (70hrs at $15). I have a credit card debt of $5,000 that I am paying off increments of $294. This went into collection and I'm dealing with creditors?

This debt was accrued from moving out of state for college, having to pay living expenses there and helping to support my family killed me and I moved in my now ex. 

If I had to take custody of my niece, I would but I can't at the moment. After my move and after being in an isolated relationship, I don't have any friends that I could live with. My ex and I work together, and his mom may let me live in one of their spare bedrooms, since she knows of my situation, but he wants no contact to pursue another girl so that's obvi not an option. 
Grams lives with my cousins and they have no room for her. Gramps lives 90 miles into the country and I would have to commute an hour and half to work each way to work, which I guess is an option if he'll take me.

If you have advice, let me know. I live in a large metropolis. Living is very expensive here. PM with help.

She seemed okay with me too – she was totally fine with coming up to me and starting conversations, so how was I supposed to know she hated me still?

Anyways, I brushed it off again. But recently, I noticed somebody on Snapchat named ilove[my full name] had added me. I was really creeped out, and asked all my friends about it, and they were creeped out too. I decided to add them back just to see what they said. 

I have a crush on you is what they sent me. I asked them who they were, and they only said a friend from class.

Then they started to ask for pictures of me. Send me cleavage I was terrified, but also kinda found it comical despite the situation. I basically told them to fuck off.

Then they told me how they had a crush on me but they were ugly and I wouldn't like them back so just send hot pictures please. Um, no. I told them they were a creep and I wouldn't send them anything.

I told all my friends and my older sister [20 F] about it, showing them screenshots. I knew it was Sarah – there was absolutely nobody else it could be. I checked her Tumblr, and the times she posted on her blog matched perfectly with the times that I received the Snapchats. Mysterious, right?

 The thing is, all of my friends are still on good terms with Sarah and like her a lot, and I know they think it's weird that I still dislike her. I feel like they don't believe me and that I'm just being paranoid and weird.

I decided to Snapchat the person, telling them that I knew it was Sarah and that this was pathetic and sad. No reply as of yet.

I don't know what to do. Am I overreacting? This doesn't count as cyberbullying, does it? But most importantly, what can I do to defend myself? I mean, I already told my friends, but there's not much they can do, especially since they won't believe it's Sarah.

My sister is a bit more supportive, but she doesn't really care and I know she wouldn't want me to make a big deal of it, same deal with my parents. School doesn't start for nearly an entire month, so I can't go to my guidance counselor like I normally would. 

I just really hate feeling like this. I'm so afraid to go out in public because I feel like I'm going to see Sarah there. I'm absolutely terrified of going back to school because I might have a class with her. I feel so helpless.

&amp;nbsp;

My issues started approximately a month ago when my best friend of 3 years, Roger [22 M - my friend of 3 years], and his girlfriend of 12 months, Sarah [22 F - my friend of 2 years], broke up. Both Roger and Sarah often came to me when their relationship hit rough patches. After countless issues I felt their relationship was probably the cause of more problems than good in both their lives. Neither of them particularly loved my change of attitude but they knew I was saying what I felt was best. After some other friends gave them similar advice they had a very messy break up. Sarah was sad but knew it was for the best but for a long time Roger was in denial that the relationship was even over and refused to talk about his feelings.

&amp;nbsp;

That all changed about three weeks ago when Sarah told Roger she had slept with another guy (after they had broken up). However, since the relationship wasn't over in Roger's eyes he saw this as cheating and asked Jason [22 M - my friend of 2 years] (another mutual friend of Sarah, Roger and I) and I to stop talking to Sarah. We obviously, didn't think such an extreme response was warranted since they had broken up at that point. However, I was annoyed at Sarah for telling Roger. I eventually told Roger I would at least make it appear to him that Sarah and I are no longer friends. It wasn't ideal but Roger was very angry and I didn't want to risk our friendship. Jason never really promised anything but Roger wasn't as close with Jason as he was with me so he didn't push the topic.

&amp;nbsp;

Since then Roger has become a somewhat different person and I'm slightly worried that he may spiral into severe depression or something worse if I'm not careful but currently I don't think it's too worrisome.

&amp;nbsp;

The reason I finally decided to turn here was this weekend Sarah told me she had slept with Jason (in addition to the guy she told Roger about) shortly after Roger and her broke up. When Roger told us to stop talking to Sarah, Jason (worried about his own ass) told her that what they were doing needed to stop but continues to do things such as kiss her. This recollection has slowly eaten away at me ever since. For one thing, even though she would deny it, I'm pretty sure sleeping with so many people isn't really a Sarah thing to do and is a pretty unhealthy way to deal with the breakup. However I'm not sure how I should tell her that without her getting defensive.  Secondly, I'm furious at Jason and should probably end my friendship with him since he clearly cares very little about his friends: by sleeping with Sarah so soon after the breakup he clearly betrayed Roger and he was clearly taking advantage of Sarah when she was vulnerable and continues to abuse Sarah by leading her on. However Sarah does not want me to tell Jason that I know and I don't want to be the cause of more issues in Sarah's life . I also feel a strong obligation to tell Roger since he should know to watch out for Jason but Roger already is so unstable I'm terrified what he will do if I told him. Pretty much everything's a mess and I could really use some advice on what my best course of action should be.

I am a 19-year-old female from Germany who just finished Abitur (something like highschool graduation). For what comes next, I plan on moving to and studying at university in another city. This has several reasons: 
*1. The variety of subjects I could study in my hometown is pretty underwhelming.
*2. Also, I am in a 2 years long-distance relationship and want to move in with my boyfriend, since studying here while he's somewhere else would mean at least 3-4 years of more long distance, and I seriously do not want that. 
*3. Maybe the most important reason in terms of this topic: the relationship with my parents is problematic. It would be too much to explain this point in detail. It's not obviously broken, like only yelling at each other, and also I guess at least my mother would be shocked to hear that I think that way, but it's still that I do not trust my parents and live in a daily fear of the power they have over me.

They know about my plans, and they know about my reasons, and from what they SAY (which can highly differ from their true opinion), they approve it. But. They claim that I can have absolutely no financial support. 


That would mean that I have to work whilst going to university, while also having the first own household. I know that this will be hard, and they do too, and since my mother repeats over and over that I can always come back if I doesn't work out, I assume, they don't want it to work out, so I will have to come back. Probably I would also have to work when they pay me something, but paying myself entirely on my own means, I guess, 20h/week, and that would be much for studying simultanously. A little less, and the ability to switch a job because I can live 1-2 months without it, would make it a lot easier. 


They argue that they don't have the money. I see their point that they have high monthly costs, since my father had to accept a job in another city and now has to pay rent there, too, and I guess I would just accept that if their behaviour would not clearly show that they are lying. There a constantly packages sent to our house, with new stuff my mother bought on the internet, and it's mostly expensive stuff. When we had a week of hot weather here, she instantly bought some kind of air conditioner, but she didn't even take it out of the package because when it arrives, the hot weather was gone. Now it stands there, unused, and no one seems to care. Furthermore, she is currently looking to buy a new car. The one she currently has she bought about two years ago. And the one she had before that one is now the second one of my father, so we have 3 cars for a family where 2 people have a driver's license and she is looking to buy a new one. And no one cares about the costs. These are only 2 examples from which I know that they have more money than they want to admit to me. 


Well, I know one could argue that in the end, it's their money, and they can do with it whatever they want. I agree partly, but there's two points missing. Firstly, I have a legal right to get supported by them if they can afford. There's a law for that. They can only do that because they know I'm not psychically in the condition to fight in court over it with them. There's even a determined amount that I can claim from them in the law, but this amount is utopian. I would be happy with half of it, and even that I will not get.


Secondly, there's my brother. He's studying to university in our hometown and still living here with my parents. He does not have a job, he gets paid entirely by my parents. He also does not help with the chores, even less than I do. The thing is, he's not even GOING to university. He's like 3 terms behind in learning because he's always missing classes, not doing anything at home, failing tests. Now he wants to switch subjects and does not feel the need to go anytime, because he will study something different anyway - and that is the point that really makes me angry. Just because he can and wants to stay here, he gets paid everything and does not have to do ANYTHING, because my parents willingly close their eyes when it comes to his studies. While I, just because I am not willing to stay with mom and dad until I'm 30, get treated like I was not the same like him anymore, suddenly completly on my own because my parents' feelings are hurt from my wish to move out. It feels like they want to show me that although I'm full age, I can not do anything without their consent. 


So - should I accept that? I have not yet confronted them with my severe doubts whether they really have no money, and my feeling of injustice when it comes to how different they tread me and my brother. Will this lead anywhere, or should I just accept it?
Also, I am thankful for any piece of experience how working whilst studying can work. Any tips on how much is appropiate, which fields are more practical etc. are welcome.

23903,Non-Romantic,2pr2zm,"My parents divorced when I was 4. Personal differences, financial issues, and my dad's drinking were to blame. In the early years post-divorce things were relatively stable, I lived with my mom and brother and fairly consistently saw my dad every other weekend. As the years passed these visits grew less frequent as my dad's alcoholism worsened, as did his living conditions. By middle school I was probably only seeing him every few months, when he managed to hold a job and didn't live in too awful of conditions, and this trend continued throughout high school into college. 

At this point I should note that my dad is a very nice man, never had any intention to harm anyone, never was an angry drunk, and his alcoholism most likely stemmed from a super shitty childhood losing both parents and several siblings.. not to mention a probable diagnosis of depression and/or bipolar.. Anywho.

While I was in college he was with a woman who was an alcoholic (well all his women after my mom were), though this one made it a mission to get herself sober. This was at the peak of my dad's alcoholism as well, as he later told me he was drinking no less than a fifth of vodka a day, and the physical impact it was having on him was awful. Through her getting sober for a few months, and the quite near-death state my dad was in, he managed to get sober. He gradually got more and more involved with AA and to this day he is 4 years sober.

Throughout my dad's alcoholism I always still wanted to see him whenever I could. I know he is a great person and I always wanted to be closer to my dad. But now, a college graduate and a bit closer to feeling adult, I feel so different about it all. Not that I resent my dad for not being there, I just genuinely lack the interest to see him when he asks to meet or do something around the holidays. The times I have seen him the past couple years have all felt obligatory and to be nice, like I owe it to him now that he has turned his life around. It's just so weird because I just don't have much of a relationship with this man and the desire to do anything about it just isn't there. What is there I guess is feeling incredibly awful about how he must feel, coming out of his alcoholic stupor so to speak and his two sons are grown and generally don't care much about seeing him.

Okay, so where do I begin? I'm a 21 year old male going to the same university as my sister, who is a freshman this year. She was supposed to live with me until I graduate in 2016, but she met the guy whom we'll call John. John is, as you can see from the title, ten years older than her and is in his second year of college after however many years of fooling around and being lazy. Yes, I'm fully aware of the fact that when he graduated from high school, she was only finishing second grade. Yes, i'm just as disturbed as, if not even more than, you are about that fact. I don't like to think about it. Anyway, initially she tried to hide the relationship from me, but after I caught them making out in her room, she was forced to admit the truth to me that she was dating him and had consistently been out until 4 in the morning or so on weeknights despite my desperate attempts to urge her to tone things down. She begged me not to tell my parents (we come from an Asian family, and my parents wouldn't be happy if they found out she was dating anyone at this age, much less if she was dating someone so much older than her). I did tell my parents as soon as I could, but I did it so that my sister wouldn't know I tipped them off.

In early October, midterm grades were released, and my parents learned that she was failing three of her five classes, including ones essential to her major. In an attempt to try to rectify the situation, my parents drove down to visit us and, during this time, asked to see our midterm grades. When they managed to get my sister to show hers, my dad ordered my mom to stay back for the rest of the semester to see that my sister improve her grades. Between the three of us (my parents and I), we also hoped that her relationship with John would also quiet down a bit. But after a week, she threw her hands up, gave up on my sister, and returned home after getting so frustrated with my sister.

Literally the day she left, my sister, for all intents and purposes, moved into John's apartment. The last time she had slept in her own bed was October 10th. Since then, she only comes to my house once a week or so to feed her boyfriend my food. And every time she comes over, she brings her boyfriend with her, forcing me inside my room because at this point, I cannot even stand the sight of him. Furthermore, she has dragged him into aspects of my life where he is most unwelcome. On New Year's Eve, she convinced my parents to go to a work partner's party so she could invite him over, breaking the tradition of celebrating the new year as a family and effectively stranding me that night. Throughout the semester, I've had my eye on another girl I've taken a liking to but haven't approached due to my own issues with time management, and since September, every time I brought the girl up my sister put on a nasty attitude and demanded that I shut up. But during the Christmas break, and especially during the family cruise at the end of the break, every other sentence described how much she missed John. And when I brought up the fact that she was starting to do what she had asked me to stop doing, she claimed that the fact that I wasn't dating the girl I fancied, along with the fact that I've never been in a serious relationship before, meant that I didn't have the capability to love like she loves John. The final straw came on the last night of the cruise and the night before I had to make a five hour drive back to school. That night, as soon as she received cell signal, she called John and began to talk to him for hours. Then when I asked her to take the call outside because I needed sleep, she turned to me and accused me of being jealous, saying that my jealousy doesn't give me the right to be an asshole towards her. To figure out the number of hours of sleep I got that night, count the number of 7-legged women who have landed on the planet Neptune.

Oh yeah, I should probably discuss why I hate John. He's a 28 year old guy who hasn't accomplished anything in life. He regularly gets drunk and encourages my sister to do the same. When my sister went on the family vacation, he took trips to strip clubs. Every time I borrow my sister's phone, her phone will receive a text from him discussing how he wants to fuck her brains out (I don't care what you think. No one should have the audacity to talk to my sister like that). He encourages her to neglect classes, the very reason why she's in college in the first place, which so far has led to my sister having a 2.16 GPA in her first semester. He has encouraged her to cease treating anyone in my family with any respect at all. He is far from fit to be someone I would ever consider calling a brother-in-law, and consequently I will **never** recognize their relationship or, God forbid, their marriage.

My sister has opened up to my mom about the relationship, which hasn't led to very much improvement. She hasn't told my dad yet, so my dad still pretends to not know, which apparently has made him a lot happier. Still, it has come to the point where my parents regret having her, and I become despondent every time I have to refer to her as my sister. Right now, I don't even bother to acknowledge John whenever I see him, and I am still so frustrated by my sister that I only speak to her whenever I can't avoid it, and even then, I do my best to finish the discussion as quickly as possible so that I don't have to look at her anymore. In September, I weighed 140 pounds at 5'8. But today, without any exercise or a conscious change in diet, my weight has dropped to 125 pounds, which is dangerously close to being considered underweight, due to the stress this ordeal has given me. If their relationship fails to end, I predict that I will spend a night in a hospital within the next two years.

There are few things in the world that I want more than for my sister to dump her asshole of a boyfriend and finally stop being so hostile towards my parents and me. With everyone else in my family so far away, it's so burdensome to have to watch all of this unfold, and there are many things that I wouldn't dare tell my parents (informing them of the explicit content of my sister's conversations with John would send them both to the grave). But I don't know how to get them to break up, seeing that if I try to talk my sister out of it, she'll only hold on to John even more tightly. And if their relationship doesn't end, then I won't have much of a choice but to stop acknowledging my sister as my sister, and the love she receives from me will be equivalent to the love I'd give to a complete stranger. Clearly this is not the most desirable option, but I'll do what I have to in order to stay sane and sleep at night.

Sorry this is one huge, messy rant. I don't ever discuss my issues like this with other people.

 I honestly don't interact with this coworker much, he's coding all the time while I'm doing marketing stuff.

We made this video/slideshow thing for someone leaving the company for the summer, and he took the pictures and put together the slideshow. He's not originally from the US and his English is okay but not great. Right after we took the pictures, I asked to see them and he showed me the group photo and said you look beautiful in an undertone. I basically said, You're so sweet, and told myself that it was a bit awkward but his grasp of English wasn't great and he might have not fully understood the strong connotations that word has. And I kind of hoped that even if he did like me, I could just ignore it and he wouldn't pursue it further. We work in the same 15*15 office after all. 

He later took a bunch of candid pictures, and ended up them in the video with little things like intelligent and funny under each name. Mine was beautiful. Honestly, while mine was awkward, some of the other captions were a bit odd as well. One person got full of life and another got keeps in shape which didn't fit him at all. He showed us the video a few days before so we knew about our captions, but there was kind of an unspoken agreement among the rest of us that we were just going to let the captions happen and never speak of it again. We made a few jokes about a couple of the captions when he wasn't around, but that was it.

I was feeling awkward but hoping that his crush would die quietly. But while he hasn't said anything to me, it's clear that he's not giving up. If I'm going to lunch with the rest of the group or anything like that, he's right there with us. When a couple of my coworkers and I decided to spend the last few hours of Friday watching the world cup, he suddenly developed an interest. He hasn't said anything and I honestly think he feels really awkward about it but keeps thinking that if he can get me alone for a moment during one of the food truck runs, there might be a chance. 

I don't know if I should just let this die out. I barely talk to him, the you look beautiful thing is one of the few times I've ever talked to him. I haven't worked there that long, and we don't have a reason to talk anyway. So short of shooting him an email, I have no chance to just say hey, I'm not interested.

I could wait until he's awkwardly hanging around and drop in a lie into the conversation about how I have a boyfriend, but a) I'm becoming friends with my coworkers and I don't want to have to backtrack later and, b) most of my coworkers are 20-something guys and we have other 20-something guys visiting from our other offices sometimes and I don't want to hang a permanent  closed for business sign around my neck.

Option 3 would be to talk to someone higher up and get them to talk to him. But it's not a super structured office. We had someone doing HR, but she had to leave for the summer and has been temporarily replaced with an administrative assistant-type person. And while my boss is great, the idea of approaching him and asking him to deal with this on my behalf makes me feel like I'm 10. My boss would just smile/chuckle awkwardly until we both died of embarrassment.

I don't know how to let him down easily, or whether I should just wait until he's accepted it. I've tried to send clear signals without being cruel or rude, but I don't know.

23950,Non-Romantic,1xyxy2,"I don't even know where to start. I am posting here because I don't have any support system or anyone to reach out to at all and I desperately need help or advice. Also, I'm very afraid. It has taken me weeks to gather the courage to post this and even as I type it I'm fighting back the tears.



From as early as I can remember my older brother (33M) has emotionally abused and manipulated me. He also abused my mother (55F), his ex wife and their children (that's a different story altogether.) I really don't know why he always hated me so vehemently. My best guess is that he was jealous that our parents were now focusing their attention on two children instead of one... or, well, because I'm simply a female. He hates females. He had many girlfriends cheat on him, and from there concluded that all women are sluts and whores or gold diggers and then took all of this out on me. Every single day, for years, I was subject to his abuse. Sometimes he wouldn't let me eat. He would make fun of and demean me for anything I did that was girly or part of my own personality. (for example, growing up I loved the backstreet boys/pop music - he would yell at me and tell me I was stupid for liking that music and make me listen to hard rock music because it was 'better.')



The entire time that he would abuse me, I would try and stand up for myself and fight back. He would yell at me that I was stupid, control what I did, try and tell me what to think, try and dictate my own personal interests and personality, but I would still try and stand up for myself. This often led to shouting matches in the house. Whenever this happened, instead of listening to me, my parents would punish us both. (Why can't you BOTH get along?) Despite YEARS of me explaining what he would do to me to start a fight, protesting, trying to stand up for myself, my parents never listened.



My parents never once stood up for me, or stopped him from abusing me. I would cry and beg for them to please help me and they ignored me. They never stopped him from threatening me, from yelling at me until I cried, even in times when I was afraid for my life, or became suicidal, or starting cutting myself. They would never reprimand him from his behavior and I was just a child and I had no allies.



So that leads us to today. For a few years now I have been harboring resentment and anger towards my parents for not protecting me. This anger has been building. And then a month ago, something very tragic happened. My father's girlfriend passed away extremely suddenly and unexpectedly. My older brother lives with my dad and on a whim I added him on facebook to try and get my dad's phone number so that I could get in touch with him. (It had been almost two years since I had spoken to my brother at this point.) I inquired about dad's health and asked him how his kids were doing, small talk. I didn't want to get involved. Well, my mother found out about this. And she thinks it's the greatest thing to happen since sliced bread. She now thinks that my older brother and I should reconcile, that we should be friends and 'put our differences behind us.' When I tried to explain to her that I couldn't forgive the years of abuse he put me through, she shrugged it off and said that it was better to let sleeping dogs lie. 


Another thing I want to mention is that my parents and my older brother all deny that he ever abused me. My mom says that I throw the term 'abuse' around too loosely. She basically does not believe that emotional abuse exists. My entire family's idea of abuse is physical or sexual assault, and anything short of that isn't worthy of the term 'abuse' and she always begs me not to use that term.


So reddit, my question is... how do I deal with all of this? I have no money to afford a therapist or a psychologist or anything. I am desperate for someone to talk to who can understand. If I had money I would be in therapy in a heartbeat. I am SO angry. My older brother was even arrested for child abuse and neglect a couple of years ago and my mother not only bailed him out of jail, but moved him into our house. If that's not enabling his behavior, I don't know what is.


I'm scared. I'm miserably depressed and angry. I can't talk to my family about any of this because they have never been supportive. My entire life they've told me that I was 'overreacting' or 'irrational' or whatever other bullshit excuse, and since that's all I've ever heard to my protests it makes me so scared to come forth and post this here. But I don't know what else to do. If anyone wants to format this better or correct any grammar feel free. I just don't know where else to turn and could desperately use some guidance right now.

Thanks so much for reading.

23955,Non-Romantic,2g52xg,"I met my best friend in high school when we were both 16/17 years old. He's kind of awkward and shy and didn't have many friends... I'm super outgoing and loud. We worked together in high school and did pretty much everything together. I got really close with his family - his mom and I do lunch dates and hang out frequently. She sent me birthday cards and care packages during college. I've gone to his family events and dinners and whatnot. We ended up going to different colleges but still remained inseparable.

He was my date to one high school dance but other than that, there's never been anything romantic between us - never even kissed or drunkenly hooked up, though there have been plenty of opportunities. But EVERYONE talks about how we're going to end up married. We already act like an old married couple. We bicker about stupid things but have our stupid inside jokes and poke fun at each other... but he also knows every single thing about me. I know all of his family's deep dark secrets, and he knows some serious shit about my family as well. He's literally the one person I tell ANYTHING to - no one knows as much as he does. I can 100% be myself around him and don't have to censor myself.

I've dated throughout high school and college and post grad - he's always the person I debrief with after dates or give him the gossip about my hook-ups with. During college I actually dated one of his roommates... that was kind of awkward. He never really dates much. Like I mentioned, he's pretty awkward and shy and isn't good at meeting people. The few times he has mentioned being interested in a girl, I get suuuuper jealous. Nothing has worked out with any of the guys that I've dated, and he's still single as well.

We both graduated college last spring (2013) and are currently living across the country from each other. We FaceTime almost daily. When he moved away, I went with him on a cross-country road trip and he paid my airfare home so that I could help him move into his new apartment. He flew back to my city a few months later to visit. Whenever we're both in town visiting our families, I always have dinner with him and his parents. Next month we're flying cross-country together to visit his brother. We just do things that couples would do... except we're not a couple.

In the past few months, he has made a few non-committal comments about transferring locations for work so that he could move to the city I'm currently living in (which isn't the city we're originally from). This really perplexed me... ultimately he hasn't made any moves toward that though.. but just the fact that he has brought it up more than once makes me wonder. We kind of joke about how if we're both single when we're 35, we'll get married... but other than that we never really talk about dating or anything. 

I'm starting to wonder if nothing is working out with the guys I date lately because no one compares to him and the awesome friendship/relationship that we have. I'm starting to wonder if I'll EVER be this close with anyone, or if I'll ever have a good relationship with someone else... because what if I'm meant to be with this guy? My mom wants us to get married so bad and she's very vocal about it - she always says that you're SUPPOSED to end up with your best friend. We already know we're super close and we complete each other - he's the quiet, smart, and mellow to my crazy, loud, impulsive self. We've been inseparable for the past 7 years despite being at different colleges for 4 of them and living in different cities for the past year and a half.

I just don't get how friendships like this progress now that we aren't in high school any more. Fact of the matter is that we are both pretty successful for being so young - we both make great money and have awesome careers. I'm looking for someone to start settling down with. I think as much as I don't like to admit it because it sometimes makes me feel weird... I can't imagine settling down with anyone BUT him.

But what freaks me out is I really don't think he feels the same way. One night a few months ago, I drunkenly texted him I think it's stupid that we never dated. He never acknowledged it and it never came up in conversation again. I'm afraid if he starts seeing people, I'll get insanely jealous. It freaks me out to think that we'll both be in relationships with different people and go down different paths in life. I just feel like it's not practical to maintain a best friendship with someone of the opposite sex like we have once we start growing older and having families. But it honestly kind of freaks me out to imagine losing him.

I guess I just kind of wanted to vent. I've never actually admitted before that I think I might have feelings for him and my head is actually spinning right now just typing this out and realizing it. I really just wanna hear if anyone else has experience with anything like this and if it is possible to go from best friends to a relationship? I don't know if I wanna say anything to him because I don't want this friendship to blow up in my face...  but I also don't wanna miss out on what could have been.

I need some really good advice. 

Background: I have been working in a small creative firm. The creative firm consists of the creative team and the development team. I am part of the creative team and my coworker is part of the development team. I have been working here for a year and a half, and my coworker has been working for about a year now. So, I have been working with her for a year in the same creative firm. She has very little patience and when she feels pressured by our boss to do everything quickly, she gets mad at me very easily. She yells or comes over and takes control of my computer. Basically, I feel like she throws tantrums.

The first episode of this happening was when I had my first joint project with her. It was my first time for that type of project, so I get that she got very impatient and would get annoyed. So I let it go. Unfortunately, this has gone on for the whole year. 

We recently had another project where we were paired together. I made a small mistake this time, and she got mad. Then she said It's okay, it's not your fault. It's because our boss is pressuring me. I was very irritated and pissed by this point but tried to understand (though, I wanted to punch her in the face), but that wasn't going to be because she's manipulative. 

My boss went over to check on her and this is where she got a bit f-ed up—she exaggerated a story to my boss. She could've just said Hey, could you resend me this file? The button is too small for desktop. But instead, she tells my boss that I didn't hand off anything to her and that she could no longer continue for the day(which is not true). So I got in trouble — my boss started yelling at me. As usual, I had to run inside the bathroom afterwards to cry.

When we're not working on a project together, she's nice — not genuinely nice but I'll take it (I'm an introvert and I prefer not being with people that aren't genuinely kind people. Niceness just covers the top and doesn't really matter to me). But after what happened in the last few days, I just can't handle this anymore. 

I want to tell my boss, but they're pretty close. I also want to ignore it but I've held my tongue for so long. I'm literally at my wit's end. I will take any advice. Thank you.

Last ye ar was tough for me, but I still always had my job and paid what bills I could. My brother on the other hand can't hold a job down, when he does have a job he doesn't go in part of the time, and he spends all his money on pot, smokes it inside, comes home drunk, has 3 felonies, doesn't clean or pay bills, blasts his shit music on his kindle all day.

And then me, I now have two jobs, work both jobs on the same day frequently, pay my mom what I can while also paying bills, spend maybe $20 on pot a paycheck, I just bought myself a new car, I never come in drunk, I don't blast my music all, I clean on my days off (worked 3 jobs 16 days in a row, I cleaned the whole house on my first day off), and I help with my nephew. 

Today he woke me up as usual by blasting robot sex music at 7:30. I made a comment about it being annoying, and he said so you can do it but I can't? Uhh I DON'T do it. So at this point I was tired of it so I got my ipod and started playing music off it. So he calls my mom at her work and tattles on me. So I comment he's a loser, and then he started calling me a piece of shit and blah blah blah, getting in my face, threatening to slash my tires, so I pushed him away. 

He responded by grabbing my arm in his hands and trying to break my arm.... what. I couldn't get him off me until I hit him in the head. I was so shaken and my arm instantly turned red, and swelled up a little, I couldn't even close my hand on my steering. I left and called my mom. She told me to stop picking fights. When I got home later, my stepdad said I needed to work it out.

This is the second time he's gotten out of control violent with me. He did it in front of my dad's nephew even. They didn't make him leave or apologize.

My grandpa and step-dad are doing some major renovations in the basement, and it has really taken a toll on my family. My step dad works long days and then comes home and works on the basement until late. My grandfather babysits my sister during the day and also helps out with the basement. My mom is the bread-winner of the family and works full time then comes home to relax. I am a full-time student and also work at a very demanding job, where I find it really hard to maintain a work-study-life balance. 

Now let me explain how this all got blown out of proportion. My boyfriend of 2 years came over on a Friday night to hang out with me. We usually just do our homework together or chat and watch a TV show to unwind. My step-dad frequently asks him to help out with the basement, and my boyfriend always complies. This particular night he had to work on an assignment for a bit, so he could only help out for around an hour and a half. He worked on his assignment and then slept over, which is usually fine by my parents since he lives quite far. The next day I went to work and my mom sends me a very threatening text about the fact that I don't do anything around the house. Then she confronts me when I get home saying your grandfather thinks your boyfriend is lazy and useless and doesn't want to see him around. This is because he doesn't ask if we need help around the house. She also states that she was really mad the snow wasn't shovelled in the morning, and wondered why me or my boyfriend didn't shovel. My boyfriend had to leave really early in the morning and I had to bus to work, so we weren't using the cars parked on the driveway. 

I don't even know how to handle this situation, because I do help out with the house when I can, and I need to spend any extra time I have studying. My family doesn't make that possible because every time I come home I get scolded and treated like crap. My mom constantly calls me names and tells me if I don't like the situation I should move out. I'm not quite financially stable enough to move out, as I have to pay for my tuition and other necessities. I don't know what to do and would really appreciate some advice.

To top things off I ended up moving half-way across the country just to have a place to live (I moved into my best friend's spare room) and so I'm in a completely new environment and don't know how to cope with this feeling of complete abandonment/being alone.

I was never very good at making friends in grade school, so I'm not really sure how to go about making completely new friends as an adult. My ex and I met in college, and she was incredibly social/popular so I was quickly assimilated into her friend group and didn't have to make much effort.

I'm friends with Guy B for almost 2 years. He is narcissistic and pisses me off with his remarks but is the only person that has been talking to me these 2 years.

I'm friends with Girl A for about 7 months I think. She is the type to make lots of jokes and have a good time. Sadly I'm not, so the only thing we talk about is her normal or sex life and her life dramas.


We were kind of a trio, but I did something shitty.

You see, Girl A has epilepsis(something she is ashamed of). She is talking about herself a lot. Even her boyfriend's deepest secrets. I simply listened but I got terribly fed up by her stories. She was repeating the same thing over and over. About her boyfriend being possessive/jealous and that she can't wait until he goes out of country and get rid of him. As a friend, I advised her to dump him because he was really toxic to her. But she didn't listen to me. I even gave her numerous signlas that I'm really fed up and she couldn't stop talking about it.

It became dark, and Guy B visits me and my roommates. Suddently, the subject about Girl A was brought up and roommates were insisting about what intimate stuff she did.

I told them about the stuff, while Guy B was listening and added some other details.

I know, I did something shitty, I told her deepest secrets to my roommates. I really did something crap.

Next thing you know, some incident happened in my room and I went to her and vented. Because I thought that, you know, since I heard all of her life story, I at least have the right to vent too.
I told her that the roommates know about her health problem, and that I didn't remember that it was I who told them or Guy B. I seriously didn't remember at that time.

She then phones Guy B to know why did he say those things to them. He got pissed and told her that I was the one who did it, and told her the many times I vented about her to him, and that I find her annoying.

She then phoned me, and asked me if I was the one who told them, I then told her it was me. And that I also told her that I told them stuff about her relationship.

She then told me that she'd talk to me, but not about intimate stuff. Won't you know it, she doesn't text me much anymore, nor does she give me any phone calls. She just gives me calls about schoolwork.



I really am a piece of shit. But I can't seem to get rid of this feeling that I'm missing something. I can't get rid of the feeling that Guy B didn't tell the whole story, that there have been some things he missed telling them to Girl A. He always said that Girl A is annoying too, and that he doesn't like her indifference and many other things. Yet now they're best buds because I was a piece of crap and told her intimate info to my roommates. It's not like my roommates have any sort of connection to her, or know her irl, but I felt that I shouldn't have kept this thing a secret to GIrl A.



People have told me that I should simply change the subject if I don't want to talk about something, but really, if someone says intimate things to you,that really mean to them, you can't simply say : I don't care, oh look a car. That's really rude.

I stopped at the place I was told to wait to be picked up at and he sat down beside me and asked what was wrong, I was irrationally angry and told him that he just used me as a back up friend, that he didn't want to spend time with me when he was happy with his girl friend, and that his suicidalness was not good for me and that I couldn't handle it, he looked at me with the most defeated expression I have ever seen and just turned around and walked away

I feel like the worst friend in the entire world...He was incredibly anti social when he was with his last GF but part of that was because he was just starting to transition, and of course he would spend time with him girlfriend that's what people who date do. right now I have no idea what to do, I feel like I have fucked things up with my best friend in the world and I am scared he will wind up hurting himself again.

I had it drilled into me, from an early age, that anything illegal was completely and utterly out of bounds.

My friends have recently become friendly with this pothead who dropped out of high school. I'm not friendly with him at all, in fact I've never even spoke to him. When I first heard they'd smoked weed when hanging out with him, I wasn't too worried. Just because they did, doesn't mean I had to.

Yesterday, however, I went to a party, where one friend, lets call her A, and another friend, S, also came too. A drove me there and was my lift back, so I had to stick with her for the whole party. Turns out S had arranged to get some weed from the pothead, O, who had gone off to get it from his dealer (that's what they told me anyway). I was a bit anxious about this. In the end, S and A walked back to his house at 11:30 pm. I had to go with them because there was no other way of me getting back home and the party was over.

There were a couple of other people at the house, completely pissed and smoking weed. This is where I felt uncomfortable. I didn't feel like I could say anything to A because she was driving me back home. An hour later, O eventually came back, high and pissed, and gave S shit loads of weed. None was offered to me, but I was extremely uncomfortable. S rolled up a joint on the way back home but didn't smoke it. 

I can't tell my parents because if I do, they will, for sure, tell S's parents and in the end I'll get all my friends in trouble. But I don't want anything to do with these people anymore. I've been drifting away from my friends for a while, towards another group of people who I generally prefer as company.

How should I let them know I don't want to be friends with them anymore? Should I slowly stop hanging out with them, or just tell them up front?

24053,Non-Romantic,1ulp23,"It's pretty long but before I start, I'm not sure if this is allowed in this sub, but I wanted to ask anyways so if it's not allowed here, if someone could direct me to where this would go that'd be awesome. Oh and throwaway cause like 2 people use reddit from the story they know my username.

Alright, to start. My best friend, let's call him Tom is in a relationship with another one of my friends, lets call her Nicole. Now, we all lived together last year in dorms. Myself, and another person kinda linked Tom and Nicole up because they both liked each other but weren't acting on it, and due to drama of college freshman a lot of stuff happened in which one thought they didn't like the other etc.. etc. Anyways, they've been together for almost 8 months now. Nicole has a best friend, name him John. John's what you'd call a typical scumbag. Sleazy, stupid, alcoholic, kinda nerdy but whatever. You kinda get the point. Nicole's got a few friends like these from our floor. She's pretty much friends with kids from the floor that everyone, including Tom, hates cause they're either two faced or just assholes. 

Now it's second semester of Sophmore year, me and Tom are roommates. Nicole lives right across from our apartment complex in the other complex, and her friends including John live near our complex too, but a little farther of a walk (prob a few mins).

I really wouldn't be concerned over other peoples relationships at all, but me and Tom talk a lot before we sleep, sometimes staying up till 5 am just talking some days. 

He tells me a lot about how he loves Nicole and what not, but she's always around John and those kids and he thinks it's messing with their relationship. I can totally see why he'd say this too as John and his friends are the kids who drink every night, get shitty grades and then complain about the school being too hard.

A bigger reason as to why he'd say this as well is the fact that John is extremely touchy-feely with Nicole, which people from our dorm noticed too and told Tom to talk to John about. Tom's a complete pussy and won't talk bad to John to his face or hurt him for going out of bounds with his girlfriend just because he fears Nicole will dump him if he does.

 I punched John in the face before for it (and other personal reasons) because I got sick of Tom not doing anything and Nicole doesn't really talk to me anymore other than when she's over and we'll just talk normally, but I don't care enough about her for it to make a difference to me.


It's Tom's first real relationship, and I've told him my flat out answer is just talk to her about it and if it doesn't work just tell her it's not working out and move on. He's a complete idiot about it though so he doesn't take that as a solution because he thinks it's not her fault. Which I sorta don't agree with but whatever.

I'm just not sure how to break it to him. I've told him just move on, but I feel like he's going to be so depressed and his grades will just fall all next semester if it happens. I don't wanna prolong the inevitable either, but if it's mend-able I'd like suggestions to give him.

24066,Non-Romantic,2vx4iw,"My best friend comes from a Muslim family where she is often taken for granted and neglected upon. Though she has not told me how she really feels, a part of her wants a way out, and she thinks the only way to achieve that is to get married and have a family of her own. 


Since a year ago, I haven't been able to contact her as much as we both have our lives, we both work and although I still care deeply about her - I just can't talk to her daily. 


It started 2 years ago when she told me about her SO at the time, whom she met on instagram - he was 6-10 years older than her and they were dating for a few months. Their dates would always have to be in secret locations where the possibility of them meeting someone they know would be low - because she couldn't risk her family finding out. 


Six months into the relationship, she would always tell me that they wanted to go on double dates with me but whenever it came down to it, he would always have a reason for not being able to come. I told her that this is a potential red-flag that he didn't want to commit to her - he made no effort in meeting her friends. Since that point I've been wary of him, and reminded her to be careful. She was in head over heels for him so I doubt she would've listened to me. She also told me of another date they went on where he took her to his friend's house where they had sex (she lost her virginity to him), and at the end, he took her to a train station so she could take an hour train home. Because for some reason he couldn't drive her home safely? I was very concerned about this, she assured me that the sex wasn't forced upon her and she wanted it. I didn't press the issue because it is her life, but I expressed that I don't approve of his methods, and it seemed like he didn't care for her. 


Fast forward a lot of lies on his part, he told her he had an arranged marriage in a weeks time, and he was getting married to a woman who had children from a previous marriage. My best friend was heart broken, believing that a potential future of hers was crushed. I reminded her that arranged marriages do not happen within a week and that he must have been aware of it for some time without telling her. I advised her to cut all contact with him ASAP, that not once in the relationship he put her first, and it was solely based aroundt him. Although she kept telling me she had done so, I found out that after all this time (a year since now) they have been friends, and he's been stopping her from moving on with her life. As far as I know, it's a platonic friendship but he clearly has other motives - he's been sexting her. I'm not sure whether she's been flirting back, but regardless, she's chosen to ignore my advice and kept contact with him. 


Recently, she told me that even his arranged marriage turned out to be a lie. In fact, he had a wife for 8 years and the children were his. He lied about his name, his address, and everything she knew about him. All this time, he had been telling her that he would leave his wife for her and she blindly believed him - she had hopes of winning him back, and breaking him out of an unhappy marriage. She told me that his caused her to stop their platonic relationship completely, and she has since moved on. I sincerely hope so in her case, but I don't have faith in her answers as she has hidden the truth from me in the past. 


He is one of the cases where I think her ventures for love has endangered her safety and well-being. Another one really had me crying, where I actually feared for her life. She didn't tell me any of the details until a month after it happened. 


She had met another guy on kik whom she had been talking to. They have exchanged nudes to each other, and he had threatened to leak them on facebook where her family would see if she did not book a hotel room and meet him there. Out of fear, she did has he commanded (please remember that in a muslim family, she would get disowned if they knew anything about her dating habits). He then proceeded to rape her, both vaginally and anally, he left after he was done with her. She told me she bled a lot, and under advice of a work colleague, she took a swab test and went to see a gynaecologist. I heart completely sank when she told me this, and I feared that he would repeatedly blackmail her like this, I told her to report it to the authorities, and if she was scared to, I would be by her side to do so. She begged me not to say anything to anyone, if she had reported it, her family would find out and she would be shamed. I told her that I would stand by her choice, but she has to start telling me everything that happens and stop making such rash decisions. And if the next time he contacts her, she *had* to file a police report, or even set him up for arrest because I doubt she was his only victim. Since then, I haven't heard anything else from said blackmail rapist, and I have asked her, but she has said he's left her alone now. I only hope that that is true. 


I am aware that she has several dating profiles on websites, and I fear that after everything that has happened, she still isn't aware of the dangers of meeting someone online. Not to discourage online dating, I too met my boyfriend online, but she doesn't seem to be taking the right precautions to be safe. She often mistakes attention for affection - another guy (whom she also met online) bought her a dildo for her birthday*... like really?* She just laughed it off and played it to be a very thoughtful gift. 


I am so scared for her that she's so desperate for love that she's putting herself in danger. I don't know how to approach this because I don't want to cross the line and ruin her relationship with her family either. I don't know what else I could do to ensure her safety without taking control of her dating life. I just wish she would consider my advice and be more careful when meeting guys. 


From this post, she probably sounds naive and undeserving of any help since she has chosen to ignore my advice countless times - but she is honestly the sweetest person. She's the type to even buy me flowers on mother's day because she sees me as a mother figure! She is bubbly, and I could have hours of laughs with her. She deserves to be loved, and someone who truly sees how strong and amazing she is for putting up with her family and her past. I love her to bits, and I don't want to lose her to something like this - I don't want to lose her at all. I feel like I could do more to protect her, but I just don't know what. I just can't sit here and give her advice that she chooses not to take because she's so desperate for love. 


So please reddit, how can I get through to her so she stops going on this destructive road for love?

24072,Non-Romantic,3303b7,"My mom and I have always been close. For almost 21 years, she and I lived with my grandma until she passed away two years ago. Last year, my mom married her longtime boyfriend, Harry. Harry has two boys from his first marriage, Josh and Walt. 

Originally, Josh took over Mom's room while Walt was off living with his girlfriend and they're drug dealer friend. After Mom and Harry married, Walt moved in with us and Josh moved out after Walt's apartment was broken into (because of the dealer friend) and they were evicted.

Instantly, he pushed all my buttons. He'd leave his body wash sitting on the side of the bathtub, rather than on the shelves in the shower so every time I'd go take a shower I'd have to put his things away. He doesn't do dishes, ever. He makes a huge mess and leaves pots and dishes sitting in the sink until someone does it or he's asked to. He has no respect for other's belongings and has broken other people's things (including a gift to my mom from grandma) and takes no responsibility for it. I'm also fairly sure he's a thief, considering a pair of my mother's earphones that I had bought her went missing and she is like a hawk with her earphones and iPod. 

Last christmas, a friend brought me a four pack of Jones soda, which excited me so much because I rarely get it. The friend and I each had one and I put the remaining two in the fridge to save. The next morning, I find one of the sodas gone. I'm furious and take the other to my room. A few hours later, I find the empty soda bottle on the windowsill next to the other two that had already been drank. He's also used the food that I've bought and cooked for myself for lunches while I'm at work to feed him and his girlfriend (who I'm not the biggest fan of either) and left me maybe a bite or two. When I complained to mom, she said she'd make him buy me more and then changed it to her buying it for me.

I can only complain to my mom about this, not Harry. Harry doesn't do well with criticism to his kids. I once tried to give him a heads up that Josh's daughter had taken something of Mom's and instantly, Harry was yelling at me about it. 

What I think is going on is that Walt is a narcissist, or at least having some of the characteristics. I know Walt's mother is a narcissist (the shit I could tell you about that woman) and that Harry is/was an enabler so he's always enabled Walt to be this perpetual child.

Walt also does not have a job. He doesn't even have a high school diploma or a GED. He never finished school because he couldn't wake up and claims he has ADHD. He can't hold down a real job - the only thing he does is be a helper on construction sites and gets laid off constantly from it. And then when he's not working all he does is sit in his room and play on his Xbox. He doesn't contribute at all unless he's asked.

I am fairly protective over the food I've bought. I'm committed to a low calorie diet and losing weight so all the food I've bought is the only food I can have. I won't eat the food the family has bought and I thought I made it clear to them not to eat mine, what with my name on everything.

The other night I came home from work and discovered a good chunk of my chicken gone. Mom asked me what was up and I explained it to her and she goes, Oh I told Walt he could have some.

I get very mad at her and tell her that no, he couldn't and why would she do that? She knows how I feel about him taking my things. She gets mad at me in return and leaves. 

The next night, I get off work again and come home. I'm very tired, working at a job (outside, on a very windy day) that I do not enjoy but stick it out because what else am I going to do? Walt is frying a bunch of chicken up which I ignore because I'm not going to eat it. I go into my room to relax when I hear him ask my mom to go to the store for more oil. She says no but then turns to me to go. I say no, I won't go. And Mom just started yelling at me, asking me why I won't go and is it because of the goddamn chicken? 

I'm upset, because she's never yelled at me so I just close the door. The rest of the night I can hear her just wailing in the house, which honestly pissed me off more because if anyone should be crying, it's me. 

The third day, yesterday, I walk to work and I don't get off until nighttime. I've decided I'll walk home rather than ask for a ride because I don't want to ask Mom for anything and as a plus, it'll be good for me. Near the end of my shift, Mom texts me to let me know Harry is getting off work early and will pick me up. I text back that no, it's fine. I can walk. I get a sarcastic reply of oh wow followed by demands that I get into the truck because I can't cry anymore. So I get into the truck after work and Harry pretty much ignores me, which I know is because of my fight with Mom and it being over Walt.

Today I've been avoiding her. But we're going to have to talk soon and I'm not sure she'll understand how she broke my trust and then disrespected me by allowing Walt to eat my food. She's always saying she'll do anything for her kids, which is fine. But why couldn't she have asked me? 

And I'm worried I'm overreacting. It's not JUST about the chicken, it's about everything really; the fact that I work very hard for my money and my mom just essentially gave it away to my stepbrother who isn't even trying to fix anything in his life, because Harry and my mom let him get away with it.

It's been very stressful and I would just really appreciate an outside perspective.

Our history makes this more complicated than it sounds. My ex (34F) who we'll call Jess and I met at the beginning of our final year at Uni when we were both 21. At the time she was a live at home student in the city where we went to uni. I was from around 100 miles away. We hit it off straight away fell for each other and when uni finished we both got jobs and rented a place a few streets from her parents place. This changed my plans as originally I planned to go and find work and live in London. 

Work was good for both of us and our social life revolved around her local pub and her group of friends. They soon became my friends with a couple of my uni mates also joinging the group. It was a great time and a lot of fun and many of those people are still my best friends now and I still see them regularly at the same pub.

Jess's best friend we'll call Sue was a couple of years older and had a son who we'll call Jake who was 6 when I met her. She was a single mum who when she found out she was pregnant at 17 the dad (18M at the time) dropped everything and went travelling. He settled in Australia and comes back every couple of years to see his son.

I always liked Sue and we soon became good friends. She was a hairdresser and worked long hours to make ends meet. Between Jess, I and Sue's parents we used to look after Jake to help her out. Over the years he spent a lot of time with us, stayed over reularly (our spare room was called Jake's room), holidays, we took him for days out and I took to see football (soccer) and rugby matches and we developed and very much still have a brotherly relationship. I'm the big brother he never had and vice versa for me. I've watched him grow into a great young man and now he's just finished his 
first year at uni and he is the (19M) in the title.

After 11 years with my ex the relationship fell apart. We were engaged, living in our own home at this point with plans to marry. She became good friends with a gay guy at her work and stopped spending time with me and our friend group to hang out with him. Most weekends she would spend either Friday or Saturday night out clubbing with him and be with a couple of evenings in the week. 

Two years into the friendship he decided to go travelling, he's 8 years 
younger, and she felt she'd missed out on this because of our relationship, even though we travelled a lot over the years and decided to go with him. She broke up with me towards the end of 2013 told me she felt like we were more like house mates than lovers, had me buy her out the house we owned so 
she had money to travel and disappeared for a year in Feb 14. I was heart broken and devastated at the time. Sue thought Jess was an idiot for leaving me and had told her so, they fell out over it for a while before Jess left and Jake stopped speaking to Jess completely. 

When we broke up I didn't lose our friend group which included Sue that I thought might happen, in fact they were a great support and were pissed at Jess for how she finished with me. Slowly over last year I got over Jess hooked up with a couple of girls, had some fun, got back into decent shape and got to know myself again. 

New Year's Eve 14/15 I celebrated the New Year at my local with my friends. We had a great night and in the early hours of the morning I walked home with Sue. This was nothing new as we lived in the same direction and I would regularly walk her home. She invited me for a night cap and again this wasn't new as I'd done it loads of times before when with Jess and since we split up. 

Long story short she confessed to having feelings for me that had 
developed over the previous six months. She had wanted to tell me for a while, but wanted to be sure that I was over Jess and said I had been back to my old self for a while and felt the time was right. I was in shock as I had only ever looked at her and loved her as a really good friend. Now saying that, I've always thought she was a good looking woman and out of my league and due to her being my then girlfriend's best friend and one of my best friends never allowed myself to look at her that way. I would say I'm average looking guy 6/7 out of 10 at best. Sue is a petite, shortish about 5'3'' brunette 
bombshell with a great figure. She's 9/10 out of 10 easy (I am bias).

When she told me I sat there in disbelief for a few seconds, didn't say anything and processed the information. Very quickly the walls I'd put up came down and I just leant in and kissed her. I didn't go home again until very early on Monday 5th Jan to get ready for work and we pretty much have unofficially lived together ever since until the beginning of July when I moved in properly. We are both extremely happy and our friends say they've never seen either of us so happy. We seem to compliment each other, share and support each other in and out of work and the sex is amazing. The only 
issue we've had in the last seven months is how Jess reacted when she came back in February. It appeared to be one of those situations where she doesn't want me, but doesn't want anyone else to have me. Especially her best and oldest friend. She appears to be coming around a bit now though as there's not a lot she can do about it.

Now for the problem, Jake was away at New Year with friends and every time he has been home from uni since including a couple of weeks at Easter I have moved home as we weren't ready to tell him we were together. We wanted to figure it out ourselves plus he's never had to share his Mum with anyone. She has dated over the years and had a few one nighter's, but she always put Jake first and the relationships she had never lasted long enough for her
to be comfortable for the men to meet and be in Jake's life. She also worked really hard to first build her reputation as a hairdresser before opening her own salon with help from her parents, Jess and I and another friend. She's worked her ass off to make it a success, paid us all back and is now reaping the rewards.

As part of moving in with Sue I've rented my house, tenants moved in last weekend. Sue is picking Jake up from uni this weekend, he stayed on for six weeks to complete a work placement since term time finished. He's home now until mid September and I can't move out this time! When they get back on Sunday we are going out for something to eat and to tell Jake about us. I'm nervous as hell about telling him and don't want to ruin our relationship.

Email #1: Aunt Cindy, I am sorry to hear about your car accident the weekend after Thanksgiving. I am glad that it was not more serious. I hope that you are feeling better. 

I wanted to write to you since there was an obvious bit of awkwardness between us at Thanksgiving. Moreover, I still feel a bit hurt by your actions and words from the summer before last. I don't want any lingering resentment on my part and I don't like holding grudges so I am getting it off my chest now. I also like to be direct and let people know how I feel; it's just how I roll. 

Firstly, I need to let you know that you really hurt my feelings at Grandma's house following her passing. The way in which you spoke to me made me feel truly awful. I felt like you insinuated that I was desecrating her memory by taking a few pieces of jewelry to remember her by on the day that we buried her. I also had every intention of running that by you. I was simply looking at things when you rudely asked if I was going to include you. Additionally, I was leaving the next day and never returned to that house. I was not aware that you all would go through and send me things (which, by the way, I really, really appreciated.) 

I know that it was not the best timing and that you were and still are very saddened by Grandma's death. I was extremely upset about it as well and the jewelry incident made me feel like I was not entitled to get something of hers to remember her by. She was really special to me and the way the situation played out made me feel like I wasn't entitled to be as sad about her death as you were; like I was doing a terrible wrong because I didn't deserve to get anything of hers. 

And lastly, I felt like you acted very rude the day following this incident when you walked up to me, Tom and Xavier and greeted us with, Should I even bother saying hi? You then proceeded to tell my father that I wouldn't say hi to you or something. Honestly, that was one of the most immature things I have ever seen. I did not and will not respond to a greeting like that. 

I am not asking for an apology, I just needed to let you know how I feel because Thanksgiving was awkward and I felt like you made some more immature, snide comments, which may not have been directed at me. Since we have never discussed the jewelry argument though, I was left wondering if they were and that is not something I want to do in the future. 

I feel like I can let this all go now that I have been able to express it to you. I apologize if this email upsets or offends you but I just had to get that out for my own well being. 

Hope you guys are having a magical holiday season and that Sam gets more awesome gifts! I have Jury Duty tomorrow so, if I'm picked, I might spend Christmas Eve hearing about some dumb ass's crime or something. Ugh.

RESPONSE (copying our family members): 

I apologize if this email upsets or offends you but I just had to get that out for my own well being. 

I'm glad you've gotten this off your chest. You should feel much lighter now that you have done so and now no longer have an aunt, an uncle and a cousin. 

Thanks a lot for this at Christmas while I am still recovering. It was so thoughtful of to spread such cheer. And if you wonder why I am so upset, perhaps you should have someone who is not completely selfish (maybe Tom) read this over and explain it to you. 

I am ccing other interested parties so that they will understand what has transpired. 

RESPONSE TO THE RESPONSE: 

Hi Interested Parties! 

I hope everyone is doing great. I am sorry if my note offends any of you as well. I am also sorry if this makes it difficult or awkward for anyone in the future; my intent was just the opposite. I felt that I just needed to be true to myself and my feelings. Further, I didn't want to let the tension go unaddressed and I thought this could help get everything out in the open so we could move forward. 

Cindy--I did this to attempt to have an actual relationship with you but if my honesty inspires you to sever your relationship with me, then I want you to do what makes you happy and what you feel is best for you, though I will admit that it saddens me that you feel this way. I love you and I am sorry that you are unhappy with me. 

I am also sorry that the timing was not ideal, I truly do wish I had waited. 

Love you all, hope you're having a great holiday.

TL;DR My aunt made me feel like horrible so I sent her a direct, honest email to air out the issue. She responded and copied our whole family, berating me using only sarcasm and cutting me off from her as well as her husband and son. I tried to explain my side even further because I didn't feel the crime (an email) warranted the punishment (disownment).

My siblings (13/F &amp; 19/M) and I (22/F) have always had an incredibly volatile relationship with my parents, and I have always thought of it as subtle abuse. I say subtle because in the traditional sense, we are well taken care of, not hit, not neglected, and it is not outright malicious, but we are frequently subject to extreme discipline, controlling behavior, stalking, humiliation etc. 

I could name many, many specific instances, but it would be a wall of text, so I will just talk about what happened this morning.

My sister is doing poorly in school (8th grade). She has consistently been doing poorly in school, and has been in the cycle of taking away her phone, laptop etc. Nothing wrong with that, however my parents go above and beyond every time, stooping down to her level, screaming in her face, imitating her etc. But today I think it went overboard, as they went onto her Instagram and change her whole profile saying she was a failure failing all of her classes and uploading a photo that said she was grounded for failing so don't try to contact her. Stuff like that. I think that is completely inappropriate as a parent and just plain mean and humiliating. Her grades are no ones business but hers and my parents, and making it public is mean. My sister has been crying in her room and my parents are sitting in the kitchen laughing about it.

Now, I do still live with my parents (live in one of the most expensive areas of the country) but am soon moving out with my boyfriend. I am almost scared to leave my siblings, especially my sister because I really feel she is made a target all of the time. This issue has been brought up an ignored many times. If I dare to say anything or stick up for them, I'm just screamed at. Anyone who has dealt with situations like this please help or give some advice to alleviate the constant negativity in my house.

24095,Non-Romantic,2wwczr,"I've been lurking on this subreddit for a while and finally feel more comfortable posting about this issue I've been having for a couple of months. 

Backstory: My friends, let's call one, Janice (20/F) and the other one Joey (20/M). I've been friends with Joey for three years and after a year and a half of knowing Joey, I met Janice and we've been, what I considered really great friends. Joey and Janice never hung out until we all took a class trip to Greece, which was what solidified their relationship. We hung out together once in a while, and sought as one another as a group--the three musketeers! Joey and I were really great friends, we hung out during school, we had busy schedules outside of school so we rarely saw each other. I never bothered him because I would always get shut down by every request--even though I would see him hanging out with other friends of his. Janice started working, so I've become understanding that she needs to rest from working long shifts. Though, she has the tendency to be a flake for a lot of our dates. Despite both of them, they manage to still hang out with one another and they rarely think to ask me to join them, even though I would ask them to hang out as well.

Personally, I haven't been a pleasant person to hang out with, I was always stressed with bills and other necessities that had to be paid for.  Whenever I was not focused on school, I would be working. Regardless of that, Joey had the same mentality and I would manage to make time for him if he asked (which he never did--I've also told him about that as well). Though, with the help of time, I've been trying my hardest to be more pleasant and trying to hang out with as many people as possible. Essentially, trying to fill in the void that Joey and Janice would be filling.

To them, I was the person they went to with their problems, even though they not only confided in me, they did it with one another. They wouldn't value what I had to say, because they would seek advice from other people as well. It was as if I was some underappreciated counselor who wanted to catch his break and make a difference or be at least significant in one of her patient's lives!  

 Currently, Joey and I haven't been speaking properly for a year now, it genuinely sucks. I've mentioned this to Janice multiple times and how she said that despite her relationship with him, she always thought we had a great bond and we could break through anything.

 The problem now is Janice asked if I wanted to hang out (today to be precise) and she was heading downtown (we live in the suburbs) and was insistent of being downtown. I asked her what her plans were for heading downtown and if it was worth it than just shopping (which is my least favorite past-time--but I hang out with her so she can browse around), she responded with because I am. It felt like I was intruding on her personal life (which is already odd because we know a lot about each other, and I feel like I should know if she's asking me to head downtown instead of hanging out with one another near our residence). I later find out that through her snapchat, that she was hanging out with Joey.  I was genuinely hurt. She knew of my willingness to amend whatever broke between Joey and I, and yet, the day she asked me to hang out and I could not make it downtown, she decided to be with Joey. Moreover, by not even telling me she was hanging out with Joey, she kind of made me feel less inadequate to be a part of what we once were. 

Before anyone says I should confront them: I've mentioned to Joey numerous times how I felt like he was avoiding me and how I would put him first when he had a problem, but whenever it was reversed he would always come with an excuse. After the solid year, I thought it was no longer worth it to mention anything to him, because it seems like he clearly does not care about whether or not I am alright. As for Janice, she knew how I felt about Joey and it feels odd that she is following Joey's footsteps. She has even confronted me that she felt like we were disconnecting, and she genuinely does not what that to happen. Though, again, it feels like she does not see the problem or what she is doing to our relationship.

I just do not know what to do anymore. I used to be the type of person who cut ties with those who betray me, but I am fixing that part of my personality and now I want to keep those despite these circumstances. What I am asking is any of these aforementioned people worth it? We haven't been friends for long, I am just lonely and get annoyed that I am never first choice to those I would run through flames for.

24121,Non-Romantic,3h137n,"I’m keeping this short and vague and will delete it eventually because I don’t want anyone to learn about my account and stumble onto this. This is one of my best friends, let’s call him John; we’ve known each other for an extremely long time. I go over to his house all the time and he comes over to mine. We’re practically brothers. 

One day, my family went into the city to see a play at the theater. During the intermission, I went to the bathroom and as I was walking past the crowded atrium I had to do a double-take because I could’ve sworn I just saw my friend’s mom (let’s call her Mrs. Smith) somewhere in the crowd. But I thought it couldn’t be her because she was standing really close to a black man (in the flirty position), and Mr. Smith isn’t black. I went back just out of curiosity and saw them kissing, and it *was* her. I shouldn’t have said anything, but I was so taken aback that I just gasped and said really loudly in an I-can’t-believe-it way, “Mrs. Smith?!?!” 

Then she saw me and I saw her panic, and she just stood there frozen, wide-eyed. I stood there, too, stunned, while she and the man looked on, the man asking her what was wrong. Then I just went back to my seat as fast as I could. 

It’s none of my business what happened. I saw something I shouldn’t have. If I were Mr. Smith, I would want to know, but none of the relationships involved are mine, so I figured for the sake of avoiding drama that didn't involve me, I could just forget I ever saw anything and pretend it never happened. 

A few days later, John invited me over to his house, and I went. His parents were out. When they arrived home, his mother seemed scared to see me. She avoided me and got really awkward. I didn’t know what to do. Then she told John that I should get going because the family was going to go out for something and they had plans that evening. So I left. 

Ever since then, I haven’t been back to their house and it’s been nearly a month. John’s come over a few times, but he says that his mother just doesn’t like anyone coming over because I make a mess or something like that, which is not true at all. John’s really confused about it because I’ve always been a good guest at their house. But now she’s starting to say that he shouldn’t come to my house either, and John is getting really confused and I think just weirded out by it. He asked me why his mother would want him to stop hanging out with me and I couldn’t answer it. 

I just don’t know what to do. It’s extremely awkward for me and it’s starting to affect my friendship with John. I don’t know who to talk about or what to say. I want to find a way to end the awkwardness or at least make it so John and I can hang out like we normally used to.

24128,Non-Romantic,29fss6,"My room mate and I are both university students, studying the same subject at the same school. My room mate moved in about one year ago, we had met about 2 months prior. 

Now I am not the most social of butterflies, so I always feel hypocritical when I approach this subject; there are key differences between us though, I maintain a part time job and a S/O and some hobbies). However, I will break down my room mates current status as of this point:
Not from this city, No car, No job, No significant other, A group of friends he will see 1-2 times a month.

The room mate's daily routine unless interrupted by having to go to class comprises of, Awake at 1100-1200, shower for 30 minutes, turns on computer, goes to the kitchen makes breakfast and coffee, returns to computer to browse reddit, watch twitchTV, or play hearthstone(or any other game). He will intersperse brief periods of homework/studying between the browsing/gaming. This will continue until 2100-2400 in which case he will retreat to his bedroom to watch Netflixs on his lap top. Upon typing this I feel a little repulsed that I know someone's routine so thoroughly. (I am aware of his bowel and masturbation routine, not out of curiosity but because I'm bludgeoned over the head by it.)

I feel trapped in my own home, I dislike leaving my own room, not because it forces some sort of interaction, but because he is there, always. If I want to study at my desk, play a computer game, or watch tv I have to listen to his mechanical keyboard clacking away furiously, or how he doesn't close his mouth to chew, or his gasping wheeze like laughter at some post on reddit; if I'm lucky enough to study while he studies I get to listen to him figgit with his earphone (repeatedly dropping it on the desk) or click a pen from an engage/disengaged position; this habbit has been brought to his attention, he'll stop momentarily but will ultimately continue.

I no longer study outside my room, or read, or relax there, my bed is my new desk. Also, my exercise equipment is in the common area, I've avoided using that now as well. My girlfriend, while friends with the roommate also dislikes coming over as it is Never private; this is compounded by our doors being paper thin.

I feel this is the major problem, there are others surrounding cleaning duties, and money. I use to address these topics, but I became weary of meeting a wall of apathy. Specifically, he feels he doesn't need a job, as 'It'll be a waste to work for only a year (before he graduates and moves home), and he doesn't want to start a relationship that will only last for less than a year, and that There is nothing fun to do in this city/this city sucks/people in this city are ---holes. His most common response is You don't get to judge my life, which disheartens me so much, as I don't want to nag or bully him. I was quite stressed by this last year of university, attempting to maintain a part time job, run a student organization, and engage with my S/o; as a result I stopped bringing up my complaints/requests to him, in an attempt to reduce stress in one area of my life. Which has resulted in the following...

I'm constantly on edge, and irritated with him, to the point that I feel if I bring up this subject (or another) now I will explode. I do not wish to yell at him, as he is a friend, but I didn't expect to be living with a hermit when I allowed him to move in. I'm also afraid I'll blur the line of too many subjects at once, diminishing the clarity of the message (EG, yelling at him about the common area/ not cleaning the kitchen)

So the question, how do I breach this topic in a way that will allow me to express myself without anger, and one which will not insult or assault my roommate? I feel that I can't do this without injuring the friendship/ hurting him. I have at least 2 months left on the lease, and would prefer those two months to be sunshine, instead of lavas.

I've become passive aggressive hermit who doesn't lift anymore due to a war of attrition.

24131,Non-Romantic,1n1hb5,"Last week, I moved to a new house that just happens to be one block from my younger sister (let's call her C).  Our family is close, but we don't see each other all the time.  When she came over to check out the new place, it was quite obvious that she was pregnant so I asked her about it and she admitted it, but asked me not to tell anyone because she wanted to tell our parents first.  As hard as it was for me, I kept it a secret for a week. Last night, she told my parents and then told me I could tell whoever I wanted.  I immediately texted our older sister, lets call her K.  This is the exact transcript of the conversation:

**Me**: C is having a babyyyyyyyyyy.

**K**: How did you find out and why didn't she tell me?

**Me**:  She told Nick and I last week because I asked if she was (she's huge).  She said I couldn't tell anyone until she told mom and dad, which she just did an hour ago.  She's almost 5 months!  She finds out what it is on Wednesday. 

**K**: What the fuck.  That is really fucking rude to just not tell me when you and Nick knew. 

(NICK IS MY BOYFRIEND, WHO I LIVE WITH)

**Me**: She didn't want anyone to know. The only reason we knew is because she was huge and I outright asked.  I don't think it's fucked up at all. It's her life and her baby. There is no reason to be offended. 

**K**: No....what is fucked up is that you knew and didn't tell me.  But why should I be surprised.  You only call me when you need something.  That is bullshit.  You had no problem in the past spreading my business around the fucking world but you couldn't tell me that? 

**Me**: I didn't tell you because she asked me not to tell anyone. Just like if you were pregnant again and asked me not to tell anyone, I wouldn't.  Of course, instead of being happy for your sister, you have to make this about you and act like a jerk.  What the fuck ever. Learn to not take everything so personally. Just because you are excited and want to share with everyone when you're having a baby, doesn't mean everyone else reacts the same way.  She was scared and nervous and thought everyone was going to be mad at her.  Post some more facebook shit quoting bible versus to show what a great person you are to make up for cussing because your little sister is pregnant and I knew before you did.  Seriously. Stop and think how you're acting, because it's fucking ridiculous.


**K**: I am very happy for her. That is not what I'm pissed about.  Like I said, you always ran out telling the entire world my business.  EVERYONE knows I would be extremely happy to be getting a niece or nephew.  The fact is that you keep your mouth shut for certain people and not for others. So yes, THAT is about me. Because you have always been that way. And that is why I don't give a shit about trying to have a relationship with you because like I said, you only contact me if you need something.  And if I call you, which if you haven't noticed, I never do anymore, you are too busy to ever hang out or come over. 

**Me**: Whatever. You're delusional. The only time you EVER contact me is to see if I can come watch the kids.  I don't care. I'm not fighting with you. I'm thrilled for C and have absolutely no regrets on not telling you for the 8 days I knew.  Congratulations on finally getting to be an aunt. 


So that was the end of the conversation. She didn't respond to me anymore.  As far as me running and telling the entire world her business and me always being that way, I am not entirely sure what the hell she is talking about.  I have kept SO MANY secrets for her, even when it was unsafe and in her best interest TO tell someone.  I've always been there to listen to her, let her stay with me if she needed somewhere to go and hang out.  

I've tried to hang out with her numerous times over the past couple years and it rarely works out.  Granted, she has a husband and 4 kids, so I know it's hard, but she also can't expect me to be constantly willing to drop my plans when it suits her.  I can truly say with absolute confidence that I call her to make plans more than she calls me to make plans.  I can also say with the same confidence that 90% of the time she calls me, it's to see if I can watch my niece and nephews for her.  

She has always been like this, for most of our lives.  The world is supposed to revolve around her and when she doesn't get her way, this is how she acts.  Most likely, she will now forbid me from seeing my niece and nephews for a couple of months, to punish me for defying her.  That is until she needs a babysitter, and then she'll call me up and act like nothing at all has happened. 

Quite frankly, I can just ignore all of this and write her off until she needs me, but I'm sick of letting her walk all over me and everyone else in my family.  I don't know why she thinks she's the queen of the world, but I'd really like to put her in her place this time and make her realize how much of a bitch she is. 

More importantly, I'd really like to have a HEALTHY relationship with her.  Despite her attitude, she's my big sister and I love her.

24153,Non-Romantic,20nuxx,"I'm female, she's female, we're both around the same age (late 20's) and have been friends since fall of 2011.  I want to give a little bit of history that leads up to the current event from last night. I realize this is a wall of text, so I'm going to **bold the main event that happened** if you want to skip the other history that goes along with this

*History*

I give this background to give you an idea of how we view the world, and to get an idea of our friendship.

* Problems started when she dated this one guy, Devin, for about 2 years. He cheated on her, and then they broke up finally. She played the victim card about getting cheated on, yet tells me how she made out with another dude while dating him, and also how she would secretly go and see her ex boyfriend who she was engaged to at one point. Though she would never use the word secretly. She never acknowledged her deceit like that, and never thought she cheated.

So after she and Devin break up, she starts pretending like she's interested in one of our mutual friends in our friend group. Leads him on for about half a year, tells him she'll date him when she moves out of her now-ex-boyfriends house, and has him buying her dinners and drinks etc  - yet still fucking her ex behind his back, and fucked another guy as well. She's single, so whatever, but she was lying to him the entire time. It resulted in him feeling used, and now our friend group is fractured. And now she's heading that direction again - dating a guy who thinks they're serious, while trying to see other people behind his back and specifically telling me Don't tell Bill about Tim!. Pretty blunt this time. Problem now is that this weekend we went out dancing, me, my boyfriend, his coworker friend and her. She's seeing someone, but sort of let this guy all over her. Now she's telling me she wants this guys number, and is considering him, but I'm concerned because it's my boyfriends good friend and coworker and I (he included) don't want her to cause any more problems or use him. 

* Other issues of hers directly stem from her expectation of people giving her things, or being a source for her to get things. A good example is that her car was broken and she needed a ride to visit her father 4 hours away. She asked if I would drive her, we could hang out and I could meet him, and that she would pay for gas both ways. I said sure. We get only halfway there, I have to get gas, and she hands me $30 for a $60 bill and giggles and says that's all she has. She, in my opinion, appeared to have planned to bait and switch me so I would end up giving her a ride and paying for the majority of the gas. In fact, she had her father pay for the gas for most of the ride back home (we took him back). Another time, we went out to dinner and ordered, got the food, the bill came, and then she fumbles with her card and says, can you pay for mine? I'm not sure how much money I have left. Now with ANYONE else, I would gladly cover their bill, but she already has this history of baiting and switching with me. That, on top of going out to bars and her asking my boyfriend to buy her a drink. Or TELLING some of our guy friends to buy her a drink. Someone buy me a drink! she'll say. And giggle about it, because people think she's cute.

* Most recently, we went out to trivia and met a new guy who is friends with a mutual friend of ours. He kindly offered to buy us a drink as he was going up to the bar. I declined, she said she wanted a drink. He returned with a beer for her, and immediately she was all, Um, this isn't what I wanted and he just brushed it off and said they didn't have what she wanted. She continued to be like...Hey... Hey...this isn't what I wanted! And he finally was like...wtf? I too was stunned...like, how can you do this in front of people? Not even saying thank you, but complaining about someone PAYING for something for you. So the guy gave her drink to his friend, then she complained that he gave away her drink, and he just responds that he thought she didn't want it because she was complaining about it. It was actually nice to see some sort of repercussion to her ridiculously rude actions. I didn't say anything throughout this, but it's an example of what I witness and why I feel frustrated with her.

* One of the most significant examples has been my birthday last year. My boyfriend and I rented a room at a resort hotel that has bars all over its campus. We invited many friends and suggested they rent a room ($30 for a hostel bed) if they want to drink and not drive. We made it clear people weren't sleeping in our room, and thought that was enough. My friend, of course, gets drunk and despite me constantly saying Are you going to get a room? Are you going to be OK to drive later? she ends up drunk at the end of the night, then tells me, I'm either going to drive home drunk or I can stay in your room. Even while In the room I ask her not to stay. She insists she can sleep on the floor. Then crawls in to the bed with my boyfriend and I at the foot. I leave, the front office takes pity on me and gives me a keycard to a hostel bed. Next day she half-apologizes, but contineus to insist she thought it was like a sleepover like having a girls night. And more and more stupid excuses.

* Then of course another event - we rent a vacation house with a bunch of friends for New Years (many ppl she didn't know) Everyone is supposed to BYOB and BYO food. She doesn't. Instead, she brings scraps from her fridge and tries to trade food and sneak bites of my boyfriends' and mine while we aren't looking for the whole trip. She acts like I'm ridiculous or laughs if I say wtf are you doing? She even tried to mock me when I left, saying Don't worry NOBODY touched your food! I guarded it don't worry! in front of everyone. Except she didn't recognize that another girl there was also concerned about her food being taken by ANOTHER moocher in the group. This other girl was supposed to buy food for a meal with her boyfriend (communal meal) but never did, and kept trying to take other people's to make shit. Me and the concerned girl were mainly concerned due to finances, but principle is another issue. For example - my friend grabbed bottles of champagne that belonged to other people and tried to open them. My boyfriend stopped her and she complained because she wanted to open one and said it didn't matter, that it would be opened eventually. No regard for other people's things. 

Because of a lot of the things that have happened, my attitude towards her has changed, and I'm less forgiving than I used to be. I've tried to have serious talks with her about all of these events right after they've happened, or even after that, but she literally will roll her eyes and walk out of the room and do this lalalla shit like a little child, and says stop stop stop because she doesn't want to talk about anything. There is no getting through to her. I think my change in attitude is what has caused her to say I'm a bitch lately.

I've even talked to our mutual female friend about this, who has boiled everything down to me being mean to her, thinking I should be nicer to her and stop holding the past against her. I brought up what happened last night and my friend thinks that I somehow prompted her to say this, yet I definitely didn't at all. Then she says she was probably drunk, and said how she knows that the girl has been upset, thinking that I just won't let things go and how she's felt hurt that I've distanced myself but then return at random or something. So she basically thinks I'm being too hard on her or at fault, and that that's just how she is and I should learn to deal with it, and stay out of any business between her and male friends who she might try to date.

**So after that weekend and on to last night, she brings over her boyfriend to watch TV with my bf and I. My boyfriend and I were talking to each other, joking about how our fat hurts us when we run or something completely unrelated to her, and she jumps in, Is that why you've been a bitch lately? in a serious yet typical giggly tone. Clearly, shes trying to make soething she sees as the truth into a joke. I didn't know how to respond, everyone was caught off-guard, and it was uncomfortable because I've only met her boyfriend one other time. It's like I had no position to respond - do I say yes, even though it doesn't make sense? Do I say no? Do I explain the truth that I'm bitchy to her because she's not used to someone calling her out on her using other people? I mean I was in the weirdest position, and just said, Well, I don't like getting used. and that's about it. She tried to just joke and claim she's never used anyone or something. I didn't continue. It was extremely awkward.**

How should I interpret this specific situation, but also this relationship as a whole?

24171,Non-Romantic,32h0zo,"Hi all. I am a very regular poster on this subreddit. I really appreciate all your wise comments so today I come to you for help.

I'm in University (USA) and I live off-campus with two friends, Jenna and Rachel. I have lived with them for several years and aside from typical problems (cleaning dishes, taking out trash, etc) we're very compatible. We are all good friends and we love to hang out at home or go out together. Rachel and I consider one another best friends but we also are good friends with Jenna (just not as close.)

Jenna is severely depressed, and possible bipolar. I'm uncertain of the status of her medical diagnosis. She often has depressive episodes (past ~2 years), and these episodes are increasing in both severity and frequency. Some examples:

- We all will go out together at night with friends (bowling, to a party, etc). She will have a panic attack and have to go home, usually almost as soon as we get there.

- She will sometimes randomly be in her room bawling for an hour alone. Sometimes in the middle of the night.

- She has self-harming thoughts and will sometimes claw at her face. She says she thinks this is normal and that everyone has these thoughts.

- She struggles to get out of bed and do her work. She will frequently spend several days in a row in bed, crying or moping, unable to do anything.

Jenna knows she has a problem. She says she is miserable and struggles very much with her feelings. She has a tendency to fantasize about the past. What I mean is that she sees the past with rose-tinted glasses and compares everything now to what it used to be. AKA everything is shitty right now and everything used to be perfect. 

She has a difficult time socializing and prefers to stay home alone. Rachel and I make an effort to include her in our plans but she often will decline the invitation claiming she's tired or has homework but we know better. Even if our mutual friends are at our house hanging out, she will come say hi for 5 minutes and then retreat to her room.

Her father is a depressed alcoholic. She really has been angry with him for a very long time for not being a good husband/dad. She loves him but she recognizes his mental instability. She also says she can't talk to him about her problems because he only makes it worse.

She has a strong tendency to latch onto boys and seek emotional support through sexual intimacy. It is a very self-destructive pattern. She will meet someone, fall in love right away, and be extremely over bearing to the point that they're scared off. And then she is heartbroken because she thinks she isn't good enough for them. She also meets hook-ups on Tinder frequently. I don't have a problem with sexual promiscuity but I honestly don't think she's emotionally stable enough to be having sex with strangers.

Jenna also has severe irrational fears that prevent her from accomplishing her goals. She's scared of everything. She can't answer the door if the doorbell rings. She is scared to eat foods because she thinks she'll get sick so she just lets multiple containers of food rot in the fridge. She is scared that if she travels something bad will happen. She has turned down jobs, internships, and vacation plans because she is so frightened to travel.

She on-and-off sees a psychologist through the school. She claims it helps but then once she temporarily feels better, she'll stop going and everything goes downhill again. Unfortunately she is graduating in 3 weeks so she won't have access to the school counseling center any longer and they are notoriously bad at making appointments anyways.

All of us (group of several mutual friends) are very concerned. We really want Jenna to seek therapy. I think she honestly needs medication but she's very anti-medication (another phobia.) I want to call her mom and tell her what's going. Her mom has somewhat of an idea but she doesn't know the severity of the situation. But I know Jenna will be angry at me if I tell her mom. She says her mom already has enough to deal with cause of her dad.

Please help.

What do we do?! We are at our breaking point. We honestly are scared that if she doesn't get help, she will do something drastic.

The quality of the marketing materials that my predecessor produced is...not great. Our flyers and brochures aren't hideous or anything, but there is no real method to the madness. I find grammatical and spelling errors frequently, she uses 10 different fonts on one flyer and the backgrounds and images she used all clash. It's not very visually interesting and a bit outdated. We sell cleanliness and the materials could be a bit more organized.

However, everybody loved her and we continue to use a lot of her stuff.

Any new work I create is free of spelling errors, and I spend time on Adobe creating attractive themes. However, whenever I send it to my boss (the owner) for critique, they always come back with tons of mark-ups.

He is also somewhat unclear on what he actually wants. He'll circle something and just say Change maybe? and doesn't exactly know why he doesn't like it.

This week, I was asked to update a brochure that the previous lady had made 2 years ago. I was told that the only thing that needed to be changed was a schedule. I updated it, and the boss came back with other changes. I made those, and he found a few more things wrong.

I would have redone the whole brochure but I was under the impression that they were happy with the one she made. I am a bit concerned that the boss will think these mistakes are mine. I am also worried that they don't seem to like *my* work (without a zillion changes) when things multiple things like spelling errors and unreadable fonts have slipped through in the past.

My company sent us on a ski trip, I never skied before so I went. As expected I fell a lot. This nice girl from the office stayed with me the entire day and patiently helped me around the slopes. I literally fell every time I turned, and she'd be waiting and encouraging me.

So the next day I said I'd buy her some timbits (Canadian here, these are basically little round doughnuts) to thank her. She jokingly said she'd rather have carrots instead. Sadly by the time I got to Tim Hortons they were closed and I came back with nothing. I said I'd get her timbits on Monday.

I'd like to interject here some more context. She and I chat on a daily basis and sometimes play ping pong at lunch. We share a somewhat similar sense of humour though she seems to like cats a lot more than I do. Ok, back to the story.

Well I bought some carrots (baby carrots you see in those vegetable platters) and dip and am planning on giving her those but in a timbit box as a joke / thank you.

I'm pretty skinny, but I don't take care of myself very well. I decided that this year, I want to complete a half or full marathon later in the year. (hopefully a full, as long as the training goes well) I am a really bad runner, not looking to set any records or anything. Definitely not an athlete. I work out like once a week while my best friend is in the gym every day. She has a lot more endurance than me, by a long shot. If we ran a marathon tomorrow she would smoke me, I can barely hold a pace for 2 miles without walking, she regularly runs 5+. 

Today I invited her to run it with me. For several reasons: it would be fun to run with a friend, she has crazy drive and motivation (I'm the one who struggles with motivation), and I figured she would like it as a way of showing how far she has come - which she does show how far she's come at every opportunity. I didn't even mention her weight when I asked her... She is by far my most athletic friend and I thought it would be a fun milestone to do together. 

I must have done something to irritate her, because she was annoyed with my request. She says that there is no way she would be able to do it. It's weird because she is always so proud of her achievements... I know these distance runs are challenging, but I didn't mean for it to be tomorrow... The one I want to do is in October. And I was careful not to pressure her or be disappointed if she didn't want to or set goals for her... I just wanted this to be a low key thing, not a competition or anything of that sort. 

So she's kind of mad because she didn't think I was being genuine, but I really was not and I've reread my messages several times to be sure I didn't say anything that could be misinterpreted. I feel bad now.

I don’t splurge on anything, I don’t drink or smoke or do anything like that. He expects me to account for every penny I spend(which I literally write down on paper) and then goes through every expense, doesn’t let me spend my money, all my salary goes into a joint account and he takes cares of it. He doesn’t use my money nor do I use it. It’s all saved but the issue is I don’t like the thought that I have to ask for my own hard earned money. Taunts me over little things, especially when I’m going to work or when I come back home. He never talks to me like a dad, talks only when there’s money matters or some work. I feel like running away from home everyday, but I  just can’t due to a lot of reasons. I’m frustrated, irritated and angry. Talking to him and solving things is just not an option when it comes to him, he gives no ears to what the opposite person is saying.

24234,Non-Romantic,2nnwf8,"I'm the oldest of three girls. My parents have always emphasized that I should always look out for my little sisters, take care of them, and so forth. Whenever we would have a fight or I would pick on them, my mother would immediately punish me because I was the oldest and I should have known better. It always upset me because she would never listen to my side of the story but always take their side.

My mom really emphasized that I should share everything with my sisters. If I had a toy that I liked but my sisters wanted, I should basically turn it over to them. If I had a tasty snack or treat, I should always share it with them. Etc. For example, if I had a slice of cake, I couldn't eat it by myself without being attacked by guilt and would wait until my sister came back home so I could share and we could eat.

I'm not going to lie - I felt really resentful of my sisters because of this. It didn't help that they cute little twins and everyone seemed to like them better.

I was really good at English and history, and I would often have to tutor my sisters or help them with homework, which was really frustrating for me because I felt that they never listened to what I had to say or appreciated me. Whenever I told my mother this, she would immediately say stuff like, You're the oldest, you should understand, you should be more patient.  It came to the point where we had two major fights where we didn't speak to each other for days.

Whenever my mother was disappointed with me, she would say things like, You're sisters are so much smarter than you, they'll probably go to a better college than you, or I think your sisters will have better futures than you. She would also use me as a negative example to my sisters, saying, You don't want to be like leastfavoritechild, do you? or leastfavoritechild is really lazy, don't be like her  both to my face and behind my back. I felt really hurt whenever she would say stuff like this, even though I would pretend that it didn't.

Things got better after I went to college and lived by myself. I would come back home only during holidays, and I feel like the distance made my relationship with my mother better. (Which sounds a bit paradoxical, but it is true.)

This past summer when I came back, all the stress came back again. Apparently, my sisters did mediocre at school during the year, so I was back to tutoring duty. Again, I felt that they didn't listen or appreciate me, and whenever I brought it up with my mother, she would scold me for being selfish and tell me to be more patient.

My sisters also became more disrespectful to me, and it was driving me crazy. It was small things, but they all added up. For example, they were too lazy to make their own library card, so they would come to my room, look through my bag, take my card, and forget to return it. I asked politely for them to ask next time and return my card, but they would keep doing it until I finally snapped and yelled at them. They would take my hair ties but would get angry at me if I ever used any of their hair stuff. They would eat all the ice cream/snacks in the house, even the ones that I picked out myself, even after I asked them to save stuff for me. Etc. I know that it's petty, little stuff, but it kept happening and wouldn't stop until I would get angry and yell at them, and when I would, my mother would immediately jump to their defense and we'd have a fight.

Toward the end of the summer, we had one really bad fight where we just screamed the house down. At one point, I accused her of liking my little sisters better than me.

She didn't deny it. In fact, she defended herself, saying stuff like that it was only natural for parents to favor the younger siblings and that maybe if I had a better personality, then she would've liked me more. She flat out admitted that she liked me less than my sisters.

Honestly, I felt heartbroken that she'd finally verbalized what I'd been suspecting for most of my life. After that fight, things kind of quieted down and I went back to college. Like I said, distance made our relationship better and we're cordial to each other when we talk on the phone. I haven't been back home since, but I probably will for winter break and I'm not really looking forward to it.

Let me say that I do not think that mother is 100% bad, and I know that she loves me and made sacrifices for my sake, and she financially supports me throughout college. I just feel more uncomfortable around her and occasionally upset.

Nor do I think that my little sisters are spoiled because she's strict on them in certain ways. My relationship with my sisters is pretty neutral, but I really don't see a future where they'll help me out in any way. In fact, probably the other way around. I know this sounds selfish of me, but I really don't want to look after them for the rest of my life, and I feel depressed that even though they know I have a hard time with our mom and that she likes me least, they have never defended me or helped me out in any way. I've helped them academically, given them advice, listened to their troubles, always looked after them, but I can't trust them with anything.

Ironically, it seems that they'll end up getting into a less prestigious college than me because of their grades. I know that getting into a good college and all that isn't necessarily an indicator of your future, but that coupled with the fact that they have far less drive than me makes me honestly concerned that I'll be expected to financially assist my sisters during our adult lives. I know that I should because they're family, but I don't want to be a handout machine.

I really want my relationship with mother and sisters to get better, but I have no idea how. My previous attempts to talk to them either get brushed off or erupt into a big fight, and I'm sick of it.

So about 2 months ago I told my friend [23 F] that I fell in love with her after a time of not seeing each other at all and only talking over facebook and her having started trying to ignore me without any comment at all. We talked after I repeatetly tried talking to her to find out why she started to ignore me. Anyways. She shot me down with I don't know if our friendship can work that way. I don't see you like this, you're only a friend and you meet a romantic partner under totally different circumstances so the old story. I also was the first one ever telling her that he fell in love with her and she never had any romantic relationship. Anyways: A day later she wrote me, telling me that she would love to keep me as a friend, to which I replied that I need time to think and that I'm not sure that I want that. Probably told her too much about my thoughts then. But I came to the conclusion that, while it's sad that she doesn't want to give me a chance, I still want to stay friends. Also because I really hate her behavior towards me which started the moment she thought I'm in love with her. The whole ignoring stuff and trying to find reasons why I piss her off, not noticing that she herself acted that way. And these are not really things I'm looking for in a partner. So for me it would be no problem to go back just being friends, even if it may be a little bit awkward at first. I still think that it would be a waste to cancel the friendship because of that whole situation.

Anyways. A lot of time has passed. During our last conversation (which was 4 weeks after the rejection and another 2 after what she said was the last time we are talking about this) I tried being totally normal. Acting like a normal friend. I challenged her to a game and she accepted. But when we played it was extremely obvious that she didn't really want to talk to me. She put her head phones in and listened to music all the time. After that I tried to talk to her. Asking if I'm running against a wall and she told me that I do and that 2 weeks aren't enough time and that we can talk in a year again because she currently feels unwell when near me. Well... for me that's way too long. I mean not talking to each other for a full year minimum just because she rejected me? So that meeting ended with me telling her that I hate how little she values our friendship and her telling me Pff. We never were friends. These were the last things we said to each other. That was 1 month ago now. We haven't seen, spoken or written each other since then. And I just hate it because I don't understand how all of this can bother her more than me (even though she says it doesn't bother her anymore... but well. Her feeling unwell near me says otherwise). After all I was rejected. Before that there was never any angry talk between us. And now it pisses me off so much, because I think I really lost a friend because of basically nothing and I want to try to save the friendship. But I really don't know how. It seems that every time I try to approach her I make things worse (if that's even possible).

I also doubt that she will contact me again. Humans seem to be worthless to her. I mean she has her circle of friends, but she always says how she wouldn't have a problem living without humans. Could be due to her often being singled out during her school time because people thought she was arrogant. Well, now I know why people probably thought she was arrogant, as I would say her current behaviour is exactly that. And I also think it's extremely egoistic and childish. But when we were still friends she told me how she was scared that people will think of her as arrogant again and so on. I don't think she knows that there is a problem with her behaviour and I doubt she wants to hurt anybody. That's also one reason why I can't stay extremely mad at her, even though I should. Another is that I'm not the most social guy and it's been a long time I had as much fun being with somebody else. I mean during the time we were friends we really had a great time together and basically played games together after every lecture. That's something I really miss. Especially because I don't see getting such a great friendship in the near future again. It just seems to become harder and harder to meet new people and I was never really great at meeting new people.

Now the next two years we won't see each other anyways. So that complicates things a little bit more. I will study abroad for a year and when I return she will probably start her time studying abroad. So the only contact would be online on facebook... well... should she start changing her mind. Now I really don't know how to save the friendship or what I can do. My current plan involves talking to a friend who will probably have a course with her together the coming semester and let her try to talk to her without telling her that I told her to. If that doesn't make her contact me again I wanted to personally ask her with a message if she's ready to talk again and tell her flat out that I'm not in love with her anymore but that I think it would be wasted to throw away that friendship.

WORST MISTAKE EVER. She has a huge martyr complex, I found out. She loves stepping on people’s toes and when they react  understandably harsh, she considers herself some great martyr for “caring” and “standing up for what’s right.” She’s one of those people who will send you a long critique out of spite and then end it by saying “I only am writing this because I’m concerned for you” when you know its BS and she just likes to feel better about herself. All she talks about is her exs and her old relationships that she keeps creepily stalking, even after 6,7 years.  





We talked for a while but then I noticed how...creepy she was and immature so I started to back off. We had a fight which was basically just me telling her that its weird to leave strange comments on anon and that she shouldn't be doing that because it was creepy and childish (she’s 25).  Whenever she would get mad at me, she would send me strange comments anonymously on my blog too. 
I was happy, thrilled even to get her out of my life.  


After months of not talking, she apologized recently and said she was a much better person. I felt guilty about not responding to someone who seemed sincere in apologizing, and we started talking (well, its more she sends me impulsive long messages  about everything/anything in her life. She's a narcissistic and never asks me about  my life, whatsoever. Which is fine because at this point, she annoys me so much that I couldn't care less)


Anything I post on my little blog, she puts on her blog almost instantly. When I mention  liking a book on my blog, she often immediately goes out and buys the book. Any thing she likes, she brings up in a message, and if I don't like it as much as she does, she becomes less enthusiastic about it. (For instance, she sent me a song she loved and it was from a genre I didn't care for. When I mentioned that, she sort of removed it from her blog playlist and replaced it with more piano and orchestral music because that is what I listen to. She seems so concerned with what I think about EVERYTHING and will almost always change to do what I do. Even in little things. She used to love writing on her laptop …when I said I prefer using a  notebook, she suddenly becomes a huge notebook fan and etc. She used to love only fantasy literature. Now she keeps telling me about the new philosophy book she's reading because she knows I'm a philosophy/literature student) 


For the past year, she has been following me obsessively. She follows my blog and according to my stat counter , checks over and over again daily for updates. She's found my old blogs and old youtube accounts by searching all of my info into google. 




On the website of goodreads there's a place for putting quotes that you really find inspiring. She copied hers from mine...? And the recent portion of her to read list is derived from mine.



She gets mad at me so easily. She goes back and forth between telling me I'm such a great person (for reasons which she constructs in her head) to becoming mopey and morose if I don't agree 100% of her and accuses me of not allowing her to have her opinion. Then she passively aggressively writes crap about me behind my back on another blog or to her friends.



. I have never been so annoyed with someone in my entire life. The most narcissist person I have ever met. She calls us friends and she's even used my name to establish some sort of literary  cred when a literary editor we both know. 
(She told this editor that I,niennaofnimrodel, think her writing is really wonderful, which I never said at all. Her writing is awful but I don't have the heart to tell her that so I just use neutral words like. interesting. thought-provoking. unexpected.)


Oh yeah, and when I post a piece I am working on, key words and terms from my work will end up in the next poem she posts. Not in a plagiarist sort of way, but say if my poem mentions a wolf. Her next poem will have wolf imagery. And so forth. At first I thought it was coincidental, but after this has been going on for a year, its pretty clear it isn’t. 





She's been trying to talk to my best friend too and try to establish a relationship with her. My friend told me that this girl informed her that her and I were really good friends.
I can't deal anymore. I have never been so annoyed with a person at my entire life. I can't stand it. I wish she would never talk to me again. I am civil to her. Because she had a rough life. But she loves causing trouble for people, she thrives off of dramatic situations (can't tell you much drama she's started with the little writing community I am involved with-that would take a whole book and yet, in her mind, she’s always the innocent party that no one understands)


I never ever ever ever ever want to talk to her again but I'm stuck because I'm “a nice person.”




She sees a therapist but her therapist sounds awful from what she has said about her.  She told her therapist this married man told her to stop flirting with him and her therapist apparently told her that flirting is innocent and that he overreacted…? But knowing how her head works, the therapist could have said the exact opposite. This girl only hears what she wants to hear.



What do I do? Help? : / She’s still a human being and I still pity her. I am extremely short in my replies to her constant deluge of messages, and let them sit longer and longer without responding, but I still attempt to be kind. She’s diagnosed with depression and takes meds for psychosis.  Most of her friends abandoned her.  I haven’t even met her in person.

First of all, I’m a rather shy guy. I have a stutter, therefore I don’t have too many friends. We’ve been best friends for basically 3 years, have know each other since 5th grade. Lately I’ve been getting more and more angry at him for various reason. To sum it up, I just don’t feel appreciated and acknowledged, I feel excluded. No matter what I do, I always feel bad for whatever reason. I just don’t feel like he thinks of me as his best friend anymore. Every time we do something (including some other friends). All he does is talk to that one friend (let’s call him L) and he doesn’t even seem to notice. Just the way he treats him it seems like L is his best friend. He still claims that I am however. He also seems to have more fun with him at parties. All of this is just making me feel like shit. He also said L is more fun to talk to or better say, he has been talking more recently (based on one conversation afaik). So what does he need me for ? Soon, college starts (sitll pretty close) and I fear he won’t need me at all anymore.


I just don’t want our friendship to end like this All of this is just bullshit. I’m so sick of it. No matter what I do I never get credit for anything. Oh, been best friends for 3 years, have been sitting next to each other in school and what not. How am I thanked, “the guy who always brings his books.” Wow, great. Couldn’t think of anything else ?  Last year he even “forgot” to invite me to his birthday party despite talking about it to me (like who to invite, what to do, etc). He apologized for it, but I’m still kind of mad about it. There are also so many other things I’m mad about, but he doesn’t seem to care at all. His girlfriend (they’ve been together for about 4 years now) did some things that I don’t think are okay at all, but he thinks it’s fine. He doesn’t care that it bothers and hurts me. Another thing that bothers me and makes me feel like shit is the fact that he only has time for me whenever there is no way that his girlfriend [18F] has time to do anything. When we do something with his girlfriend I also feel like the third wheel most of the time :/


Writing down all things that have happened is probably too much. Whenever I try to tell him something, he seems to get mad and deny it, says I’m just not telling the truth. I kind of cut contact since I am mad at him. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I should probably also include that I mostly hate my life, that I hate myself, that I don't think I fit into this world.

24313,Non-Romantic,23epo3,"My friend Bill and I went to elementary school through high school together. He was a bit nerdy, I was very nerdy, but in high school he hung out with a bunch of free spirit artistic types and had a very active social life compared to me. I really had no friends except Bill who'd invite me along to parties and whatnot, even into college. Bill's friends gradually became my friends and I am actually married to a woman from Bill's old high school core of friends. 

Bill was a very rebellious guy and clashed with a lot of high school teachers, and dropped out of college. He started several businesses and a few really succeeded. He did quite well financially and bought something of a dream house for him. 

But at the same time, I can now in hindsight see that he was increasingly erratic. As far back as age 19-20 there'd be times where he'd just lose it, get into an extreme rage at other friends, once literally over a game of monopoly, and also over stuff that was more meaningful. He is not the least bit violent so his rages just consisted of him storming off for a few days, but still, it was very dramatic behavior. He'd also just disappear, like if we were at a bar and he felt slighted or talked down to, he'd just walk out and be gone for the night. He had a lot of problems with his wife, just constantly fighting over money and her behavior, even though they had plenty of money. 

They divorced maybe 8 years ago, and Bill's been noticeably downhill ever since (by all accounts, he ended the relationship). He'd date women for a month or two and then break up when they started to get intimate. He seemed more and more to view life as a joke, and most everyone we knew as phoneys (he never used that word but it was kind of his attitude). He started taking long, bizarre trips... driving all the way to the Pacific ocean and back, driving as far north into Canada as the roads would take him, retracing vacations his grandparents took him on as a child... all alone. 

Then, 2 years ago, he just cut off all contact. I can't find anyone who's talked to him except one old friend who ran into him at a doctor's office, and he obviously didn't want to talk. He's deleted his facebook, disconnected his cell phone, deleted a bunch of social websites that linked to his real name. 

As far as I know he's not working and doesn't own any of his businesses, and general speculation is that he's really not hurting for money, or at least wasn't the last time anyone talked to him. 

I have gone to his house and knocked on the door and left letters, no response. I saw him washing his car one day and as soon as I approached, he literally ran into the house and closed the garage door. 

I'm really not a psychology-minded kind of person. I feel like something is seriously wrong with Bill... but this just isn't my field. And yet, nobody else seems to really care. He was increasingly weird in his adulthood and even other people who used to be very close to him just kind of shrug when I bring him up and say he's drifted away and they don't really care.

For whatever it's worth he also had a very chaotic childhood, his mom was an alcoholic and kicked him out when he was 16, and he lived with friends and an Aunt. I have heard that on multiple times friends saw her blow up at him and it was very ugly. But at the same time, he was a very well-adjusted dude into his early adulthood, he was an incredible self-starter and professional with his businesses, and he didn't seem obviously messed up until his late 20s. His wife has told me he had mommy issues, not like Psycho kind of stuff, but like he always thought she was mad at him, and if she wasn't, he'd kind of poke and prod until she was. Like he needed that kind of instability from women in his life.

I'm hoping this  story will ring some bells, maybe some of you have known guys like Bill. I really want to help him... I know he's a grown man and can lead his own life, but he seems to be utterly alone in life now, it can't be healthy.

24314,Non-Romantic,2kk8x6,"Last November, my mom and sister (19) moved into my home after they attempted to move out of state and it ended up not working out (various reasons, some avoidable, some not).  

For the most part, we haven't had any real issues other then my major frustration with the amount of junk she insists on keeping.  All of her stuff is in boxes that are taking up about 1/3 of my oversized 2 car garage.  

When my mom first came to live with me, I was with my then girlfriend (whom bought the house with me) and she cheated on me in February and I broke up with her and made her allow me to take sole possession of the house. 

Since then, I've gotten into a new relationship (5 months today!) and I am beyond thrilled with this relationship.  She (22) is everything I could ask for in a woman and treats me so well.  I need to move out of this house so my relationship with her can take it's own turns since I bought this house with my ex.  

Currently, my mom pays me $400 a month in rent for her and my sister.  Which is a very good deal, because she is paying well less than half of the cost of living there.  She has a job that pays fairly well but she hates it and it causes her a ton of stress.  I rebuilt her resume the other day so she could hopefully find something new.  

However, she is constantly job searching and very rarely happy with her job or pay.  If I sit and wait for her to get something good enough for her to feel like she can move out, I feel I'll be waiting forever.  

I know she can afford it because of the amount of money she spends on going out to eat and the movies etc. and my sister is going to school and makes a little bit of money part time, so I know she could help out.  

I am thinking about telling my mom I need to collect $600 a month instead of $400 to motivate her to move out.  That is not much less than she would be paying for a 2 bedroom apartment.  She is always saying she does not want to live in an apartment, but I think it's time she stops being choosy.

The toughest part of this is I love my mom and hate to see her struggle, but being in the midst of her struggle and her constant negativity is bringing me and my relationship with my girlfriend down.  I have to get out.  

How can I handle this gracefully so my mom doesn't think I am just tossing her aside?  I've told her many times that I care about her and want to help her but I think I am at a breaking point. 

EDIT:  For those of you asking why don't I just rent the house to her - there are 2 main reasons, however there is MUCH more to the situation which, frankly, is not relevant.  The first reason is that I do not want the risk and weight of carrying a mortgage and rent payment.  If I am renting the house to my mom and something happens, the mortgage falls back on me.  I am not up for that much responsibility right now.  The second reason is I do not want to pay to maintain the house.  The house is old enough that things are going to break and cost me anywhere from $50 - $200 a month.  Over the summer, I spent $2000 upgrading bathrooms, appliances, etc.  and I am not willing to continue putting money into it.

Because of many factors, he's very stressed, and food is something in his life that he should be enjoying, and not causing him more stress. He can be short tempered and food is an easy way to upset him.

24334,Non-Romantic,3farzw,"Here's some context on the situation:

I live with a roommate who I'll call Amy, and we've been roommates for about 6 months.  We live in a tiny upstairs 2 BR apartment and are both working and not in school.  Amy currently has a 2 year old mini poodle and she is a horrible dog owner.


Amy bought this dog on a whim a couple years ago (before I lived with her) and she has essentially ruined it.  She won't get it spayed because she is too lazy to go get it done, and her puppies would be sooooo cute though! The dog has had fleas for the past 3 months because Amy keeps forgetting to get a flea collar or medication for it. She also hasn't obedience trained the dog at all and it has a lot of horrible habits (jumping on people while they're eating to take their food, running up to other people's dogs, won't come or stay, barking, pooping in the house) but if other people don't like it, Amy will just say oh they're not dog people then. 


Amy also teases the dog a lot, like sticking her fingers in its mouth until it starts biting at her, then laughing at how cute it looks when it's mad.  When it was a puppy, Amy used to wrap it up in blankets and laugh when it thrashed around trying to escape, and she used to trap it under laundry baskets until it started howling.  This dog gets no exercise either; it stays locked in Amy's room 8-9 hours a day while she's at work, then when Amy gets home she'll play fetch inside with the dog for maybe 10 minutes. 


I've made it clear to Amy that I don't want the dog on my furniture (I own the couches and chair in the living room) and she always cheerfully says, no problem but the next day after a conversation I'll walk into the room and see the dog on my couch and Amy will laugh it off and say she forgot. I love most dogs and I used to train dogs for shelters when I was younger, but I am really starting to hate Amy's obnoxious little dog.


Then the other day Amy casually mentions that she really wants to get an Australian Shepherd puppy and she even found some available that she is going to go look at.  Apparently she saw somebody out walking their Aussie the other day and now really wants a puppy of her own, and thinks that somehow it would help her poodle behave better because it will have another dog to play with and won't have so much energy.  I told Amy that that was a horrible idea and explained to her how destructive and energetic Aussies can become if they are stuck living in apartments with no exercise, but she kind of blew me off, and she's still looking into getting a puppy.


I am not sure what to do.  On one hand, I want to just explode at Amy for how STUPID and IRRESPONSIBLE she is being with her dumb dog and how I am seriously in DISBELIEF that somebody can even think about getting another dog when she already has ruined the one she has.  On the other hand, I'm not Amy's mom and I'm not sure if it's my place to insist that she train her dog and get it spayed, and I also don't know if I can prevent her from getting another dog.  


We just signed a lease on a new apartment (also a tiny 2BR with no yard) and even if I wanted to find somewhere else and sublet my bedroom, I can't afford to live on my own, so I'm feeling kind of stuck.  Any advice?

I did his finances and was incredibly surprised to find out that he made more money than i did WITHOUT even having a proper job.


I mentioned above that he rarely has money to spend on luxuries, and thats the truth, all of his excess money went into gas and groceries. He went to the grocery store over 33 times last month, meaning some days he was going twice, this is more often (and the same distance) than i go to work, and i don't drive anywhere else, my gas is about $100 a month, so he is spending that same amount (more probably) just to go to the grocery store.

I argued with him about the groceries (over 800 for one person) he is a health nut, and says he needs to go everyday and only buy the food for each day so that it doesnt go bad, he said he has to buy the food from the health food store, because all the other stores dont sell good food. i argued with him for a while and in the end he agreed to go to a cheaper store, but said he would still be buying a few specific products from the health food store, i agreed, this seemed like a good compromise (this was the start of the month)


then the end of the month came and i saw that he hadnt gone to the normal grocery store at all ( he had 2 receipts for the regular store, he bought soap and some cleaner there but no food). i asked him why he didnt go there after he told me that he would, and he said he went there once and the meal made him sick ( a complete lie since he didnt even buy any food from that store). I argued with him for a while before i gave up, and i decided that even if he MUST buy all his food from the health food store, surely it must be possible to buy groceries there and spend less than $800, because he is going everyday, i assumed he is buying prepared food, and i planned to go to the store with him, and buy simple things that would be easy to make . I also planned to prepare everything myself when we got home with his food, for example cleaning and cutting the fruits/vegetables, and using some natural preservatives (salt, sugar, vinegar, rosemary extract) so that they wouldnt go bad. i spent a lot of time doing research on natural foods, and healthy meals, i bought some mason jars so that we could make a meal, put it in the jar, then put the jar in the fridge and eat it anytime he was ready, i put aside my entire day to help him with this and he seemed like he was into it.


Well that was a massive waste of time, everything that i thought about my father was false, he isnt a health nut at all, he is simply insane.


He refused any suggestions i made, any tips on how to cut down on costs, he wouldnt get even one item that wasnt one of the items he normally gets ( i was paying for all of this). I could spend all day listing examples of the insane things that he said at the store, but ill stick to just 3 to give you a clear picture.


1. I pick up some rice and let him know that its the cheapest food there is, and really easy to dress it up with some vegetables, meat and spice, he says no, rice makes me sick I will throw it up or have diarrhea I ask him if he is allergic and he says that he is, i say that i am very skeptical because im not even sure if thats possible ( it is, i just didnt beleive him) he insists that he is allergic to rice, and not 2 minutes later he picks up a package of brown rice pasta, i tell him that it has rice in it, so it will make him sick, he says he has it all the time and it makes him feel good, so it must not be the same thing as the rice.


2. He didnt buy a single vegetable, instead he bought some kind of vegetable suplement, i told him that we should buy some vegetables, because they are healthier, and will actually fill you up, and they cost less than the suplement, he said that he didnt need vegetables because the supplement is healthier, and i argued that no one in the world, not even at the health store will tell you that a suplement is healthier than actually eatting real vegetables. He gave me a crazy look and yelled at me that thats what the vegetable people want me to think and i yelled back who are the vegetable people?! this was very embarassing but he didnt answer.


3. He picked up some cookies and wanted to buy them, i said sure, its good to have snacks sometimes, but these cookies were about $11 for 6, i said since cookies are unhealthy anyways, why dont we get the $2 box? and he said these cookies are healthy, the other ones arent and i said cookies are mostly sugar, even these ones arent good for you and he says the other cookies will give me cancer me i eat the other cookies.... him DO YOU WANT TO GET CANCER?! fine if you wont buy these than i wont have any cookies and he slammed them back down like a child.


we went through the entire store about 3 times and it was a nightmare, every aisle we had a conversation like the ones above, and in the end all he bought was hemp protein, hemp hearts, hemp granola, the rice pasta, some overpriced meat, and some overpriced eggs, and it costed 4 times what similar items would have costed from a normal store.


I give up, nothing i say or do will change his mind, i feel like he has been completely brainwashed into thinking only organic free-range hemp is edible, and all other food is poison and will give you cancer.


I dont want to help him anymore. any non-monetary help i give him is ignored or not appreciated (he refuses to go to restaurants anymore because of the poison), and why should i give money to someone who is making more than me and spending it like a crazy person? I can afford to give him money, but only because i save every penny that i make, and i eat cheap food like rice most of the time. why should i save and save only to give my money to a person who wastes it all?


but i am also worried about him, he doesnt have the money to live the way that he is living, and because of his personality (and posible mental disorder) he has no one left who is willing to help him except me, im worried that he is going to be homeless within the next 4-5 months, and people will look down on me for not taking him in just because i can afford it, im also worried how he will survive.


i keep mentioning a possible mental disorder, its possibly alzheimers, or dimentia, or brain damage from a head trauma he got in the past, he doesnt believe in doctors or medecine, and refuses to see them, so its unlikely that he'll ever be able to get any help (monetary or otherwise, from being disabled)


He also makes too much money to qualify for welfare or subsidised housing, or anything like that, and refuses to live with a roomate.






   
**tl;dr**: I want to give up on my father, he is too stressful for me, but i think without my help he will be homeless very soon

24339,Non-Romantic,3gqykg,"My friend and I have been close friends for about a year now. Not sure if this is important, but we used to date for a few months and it didn't work out due to various issues but we chose to remain close friends. She's honestly one of the most important people in my life and I value her more than most. 

Some backstory on her: 

I'm not going to sugarcoat it-- she's had some tough spots in her life. Abusive relationships (both romantic and platonic), self harm, rape, chronic medical issues that have her in pain literally every day... not to mention family issues where she's stuck in the middle between her mother and older sister (28?) who have refused to speak to each other for the past year. 

She's always handled stress and drama pretty well. She's the type of girl who will go out of her way to help others with their problems-- people go to her for support and she's probably one of the most nonjudgmental, nurturing people I know. She offers the best advice and always has herself put together.

Recently she went to the doctor for some sleep issues and they said she might have depression. I don't think they've put her on any medicine right now and I know she's really reluctant to try anything that would mess with her brain since she's in her last year at university and it's really important that she finishes. 

She also went to another doctor recently for some irregular cells in her cervix (that she's had for 4 years) and they told her that they've progressed and that she needs to get another biopsy ASAP because she might have cancer. Needless to say, she's pretty stressed about it. 

On top of that, she's in a pretty creative field and all the stress and lack of sleep she's getting is really taking a toll on her school work. She says she's struggling to write and that she feel useless because something that was so easy to her before has become nearly impossible. 

She's confessed that she's thought about hurting herself again, but I know she's been clean (is that the right term?) for at least 3 years now. I don't think she's relapsed or anything, but I've noticed her behavior is starting to be a little irregular.

She'll be happy and bubbly one day, but then the next she'll be reclusive and quiet. She's naturally an introvert so I don't want to look too much into it, but she's talking to me less and less about this stuff. I don't want to push her to talk or anything, but somedays I'll send her a few texts with no reply and then a few days later she'll talk to me as if nothing was wrong. 

She was seeing a school therapist but stopped because she felt like he couldn't tell her anything she already didn't know. She said that she told him that she felt overwhelmed and apparently he said that everyone feels that way and that you can't compare issues with others. 

I'm sorry if this is a little unclear. I'm just trying to figure out if I should push her, let her be, or what I can do? She says that talking about things sometimes makes them worse, so I don't want to make her talk if she doesn't want to-- but I'm struggling with what I /can/ do. 

Thanks everyone in advanced.

I am in high school and my sister and I are super close; she is my best friend, so her friends are mine too(But they're mostly hers because they're all in Guard. I've met new freshman girls and they're awsome. 
They're are seven people, including me, that are in or group. We do EVERYTHING together and are so so so close. We'll call sister S and then the friend Lucy. Me and lucy are both freshmans. I am a jokester and am always being goofy, although I have recently tried to tone it down due to lucy's reactions because they make me feel stupid. 
In my eyes, lucy treats me way differently from the other girls in our group. Maybe I'm overreacting, but it kind of hurts. For example, she doesn't really look at me or listen when I'm talking. When I compliment her on her hair or something she'll give me a very flat no without even looking at me. me her and my sister all have 1st period together, and you can get a pass to get out of it. This morning she was like S, do you want to get a pass? I said, Yeah I think that'd be good and she totally ignored me. It just feels like she wouldn't care if I was alone, she wanted to be with my sister. Tonight, they had this program that showcased their guard show. I've always asked for pictures with her, because I'm very affectionate to people I care about and I've never gotten a picture. I'm the only girl in our group that hasn't gotten a picture with her. So Friend1 and lucy were going to take a picture. Lucy was walking away and I was right behind and I said Lucy I want a picture with you and she ignored me. Yesterday, we were in lunch room and I was goofing off and she said [Me], shut up you're annoying! Now she usualy says this to everyone and she just jokes, but she sounded so serious. Later that same day I was like Lucy can you tell me when to tone it down? I don't want to get on your nerves and she said she was only kidding and laughed it off. She tells everyone else things and not me, whereas I've told her everything. 
Lucy isn't always like this though. When me and her are around people we don't know or by our selves, she communitcates with me more. But lately, her ways have really gotten to me and I've been trying to not talk to her. During the showcase, I wished her good luck and she said can you wait? In an annoyed tone. I've been not acting myself, trying to be quiet because I don't want her to be annoyed with me. But I often get really sad and distant when I change my attitude. I also feel really left out because the girls have group chat together. It doesn't have one friend because she got her phone taken away, and another because they never text us and it doesn't have me despite the times I've trued to make chats with all of us. I feel really left out and almost starting crying because my sister and her were ignoring me. Am I being to sensitive? If yes, how should I deal with it and if not, what should I do? I've been trying not to talk to her or interact with her. But I don't know. What should I do reddit?

24343,Non-Romantic,35pxy4,"I'm someone who has moved around/lived alone a lot, so I'm used to making new friends in new places. I'm a quiet, introverted person and have a bit of social anxiety, but tend to get along well enough in society. People find me agreeable because I'm non-confrontational and don't mind taking direction. However, I am also very intolerant of lying/deception.

A few years ago, I became friends with a guy (gay; strictly platonic), who took a strong liking in me and we had a great friendship. He basically came up to me as a complete stranger and wouldn't take no for an answer. He was a perfect friend right off the bat and we very quickly became close - went out together, double dated, had deep conversations, etc. Then, a year or two in, I discovered that he was using me to benefit himself professionally in some very misleading/deceptive ways that ended up hurting me professionally and financially. When confronted, he feigned complete ignorance, innocence, and turned accusations towards me. He'd fully contradict himself just to make his arguments stand, and change the subject when questioned. It was such a ridiculous situation that the friendship VERY quickly crumbled; myself and the other folks in my circle of friends wrote him off as a narcissist and moved on.

Around the same time, I was becoming close friends with another guy (in a relationship; platonic), and the same timeline followed. Very close friends extremely fast - he did really nice things for me right off the bat, and even helped me with some of the mess that guy #1 had caused. Like guy #1, he was a complete stranger, and decided he was going to be my friend before I even knew him.

He quickly assimilated into my group of friends, and as the months passed, things started to change. He'd get in bad tiffs with the group, but snap especially hard at me. One of the biggest peeves for all of us was that he just started being blatantly dishonest - swearing on facts that we all knew were lies, just to sound right. Arguing for the sake of arguing. This went on for 3-6 months, and the rest of the group was quite frustrated, and very aware of the way he was treating me. 

(Typical scenario: He'd get in a fight with someone where he would be fully wrong, message me privately asking me to take his side, I wouldn't since he was wrong, then he'd blow up at me. I'd try to mediate the problem and always ended up apologizing. My friends were all aware that this was happening since it would upset me really badly.)

Finally, after a particularly bad incident, I told him that in the interest of staying friends, that we needed a break (which was met with some very unkind words about everything being my fault, and this gem: yea I do shitty things sometimes but you're supposed to be my friend). 

I've cut communication with him, and in response he pulled some strings professionally that caused me to lose a lot of money. He continues to talk to my friends, trying to convince them that I have anger issues, etc. Except, they all know the actual story because they were *literally* there and know he's making things up. They also know that I'm one of the least confrontational people ever, who takes way more crap than a person should. One of our mutual friends finally told him if you treated any of us the you treat PM_ME_SUSHI, we would have stopped talking to you long ago...you probably only treat her that way because she's the only one who lets you.

While it's tempting to just write guy #2 off as another narcissist, it does really make me wonder: why do I seem to attract people who want to get close and be best friends very quickly and then turn aggressive just as quickly? My only theory is that I'm so beta (or whatever you would call a person who says sorry first and likes agreeing with people), that I attract people who want to exert their influence over me, be it in a positive or negative way, and things go downhill when I finally put my foot down, which they probably don't expect.

I tend to long-term date very kind, unassertive guys, although have had some brief relationships that followed this same exact path (in love one day, physical assault the next). My friends are a mix of assertive, passive, and everything in between, but the narcissistic type seem to pursue me like hungry wolves, and I want to know why.

24346,Non-Romantic,3fj3pr,"So when I was MUCH younger, my mother and I were pretty close.  She made me feel loved and was there for me.  She still is there for me when I really need her, but not without having something to say about it.  As I got older she started to be mean to me for seemingly no reason.  Around 9 or 10 I remember asking my dad why she hated me and reassured me he didn't.  He went and told her what I said to him and she flipped out.  She got mad at me and at my dad saying it's all his fault I think that.  Good time to throw in my parents hate each other and always have since I can remember.  Anyway, since then it's only gotten worse.  Around 13 she started telling me stuff like I'm weird, I'll never have any friends, I'm going to end up alone, I'll never be successful in life, etc.  I started resenting her from there on.  The ONLY times she ever spoke well of me was to other people.  Right, because she's bragging about *herself* when she does.  It's *her kid* who did these things and it makes her look good.  Yet, I'd hardly ever get so much as a half-assed good job when my team took state or I got an A in a class.  If I got a C or something though, I'd get lectured for hours (and I mean hours) about how awful and ungrateful I am and how I'll amount to nothing, etc.

Well let's fast-forward.  I'm 21 now and go to the uni in my city.  I still live at home so I can save money from my job to pay off my tuition.  It's just me, my dad, my mom, and our 2 dogs.  My mother and I do not really speak anymore.  About a year ago she admitted she hated me and thinks I'll wind up as nothing.  I hardly had any feelings left for her by then; I pretty much abandoned our relationship around 19.  Now I can hardly utter a word without her going off on me.  Today for instance, I was mowing the lawn.  She brought me a glass of water (rare thing, I felt more insulted than anything that suddenly she'd bring me water) and I declined it.  I finished mowing maybe 15-20mins later and went inside to get water before showering.  She comes up and says I offered you water when you were outside in an angry tone.  I responded yeah because she did bring me water.  Then she got mad at me saying how rude I am and yelled at me for not knowing how to hold a conversation like a normal person.  Normal people would say yes, but I wasn't thirsty at the time and that I just can't understand that because I have problems.  Sure, I know yeah isn't the best answer but I try to keep our conversations as short as possible because they always end up as fights, regardless.  For instance, the other day she told me to walk the dogs.  I put their leashes on and start taking them outside.  She asks me if I have everything I need.  She started listing out shit (leash, bags, phone, etc.) and I said yes, I have all of that and my wallet and keys, then she cut me off and said I don't need to be an asshole and make a list for her.

I've pretty much given up on our relationship.  I spoke with my dad a few months ago because I had a weird situation unfold with her.  She invited me to get ice cream for some reason, so I went.  We got the ice cream and not really saying much.  She started to talk so we chatted for a bit and she mentioned how we don't get along ever and it's my fault.  I responded with yeah, you and I will never get along, but that's okay because we're still family.  She started tearing up.  I just watched her and kept eating my ice cream.  Soon she started crying and stopped eating her ice cream then just said let's go home.  She threw away her ice cream and we got in to the car and drove home, not saying one word.  We get home and I head to my room and she calls my name so I turn around and she says you're such a fucking asshole, I hope you know that.  I just went to my room and like usual she was in the other room talking to the dogs about what a piece of shit I am.  So I went to talk to my dad about it and he said I just don't get it.  I asked what's there to get, she just hates me.  He didn't acknowledge it and just said she feels so worthless in life she takes it out on other people.  She feels she's not worthy of your time and affection or that of her mother.  She treats you like she does not because she hates you, but because she hates herself.  Wow.  Straight out of a movie.  I asked him if that's true then why does she always talk to me like I'm garbage and all he said is that's just how she deals with her stuff.

So, I'm totally lost here.  It's to the point where I hate to be home (I'm hardly home anyway between school, frat, friends, and work) because I know our family isn't real.  We act for so many people and it's just such a negative environment.  I know you guys are going to say move out, but I'm not doing that yet.  I save enough money between rent and utilities that it's worth putting up with.  I just want to hear what you guys think the issue is here and if there's anything I can do to make things more civil.

My friend and I have been friends for a very long time, we spent a ton of time together starting in 5th grade through most of college. Playing video games, hanging out, and doing pretty much everything together just about every single day. It felt like we were brothers who would end up hanging out in a retirement home someday.

However, all of this changed big time when I got my first GF. We got serious pretty fast and ended up having sex maybe a couple months after dating. Now my friend is semi-religious... but he never judged our circle of friends. Some of us smoked pot, All pretty much drank alcohol, and a couple of the friends were borderline womanizers having multiple partners. My friend found out I had sex and from that moment on straight up cut ties. He pretty much told me this is the last time we will be talking. 

During this time it was a really difficult time in my life, I was in the middle of nursing school which was very demanding, and was living with an alcoholic father who would binge drink for days. It was a time I needed my best friend more than ever, but he would never return my calls or respond to text. Luckily my GF was very supportive and I was able to basically to stay at her place to get out of my dads house.

Well fast forward a year and my GF is my soon to be wife. All of a sudden my friend gives me a call (after he finds out we are getting married) and basically wants to talk. He says hes sorry, etc. but never said why he never talked to me again. So of course being my best friend for so long I let him in my life and things returned to semi-normal. And for the next 3 years we just kinda do things occasionally together (he moved an hour away). But we would still talk and hang out, but we def. were not as close... partly due to me having a wife and most of my time spent with her.

Well about 5 months ago my wife and I had an unplanned pregnancy. Everyone was extremely excited about it saying the standard oh wonderful congrats!!... everyone except my friend. As soon as I told him, he began to have some mild panic attack and all he said was I cant handle this I cant handle this, I cant handle this! and straight up left my home... Send me a text asking if it was an accident which I replied basically saying what he did was shitty and that its not like I told him I have been using meth/heroin and doing terrible things.

Well since that night he would text occasionally and I just grabbed lunch with him today (first time I have seen him since that night). He didn't say a word about his actions, asking about the pregnancy. He basically pretended nothing ever happened and my wife wasn't pregnant.

How should I respond to this type of behavior? He has always been borderline OCD/Autistic when it came to certain stuff... and I think some things he says and do people just spin it off as oh you know, that's just how so and so is!... Every time something major happens in my life he just straight up vanishes and pretends like nothing ever happened.

I noticed that Alan was not sleeping on the pull out couch, and that Brian’s door was closed, which I thought was odd.  I figured maybe he prefers a real bed, and they are pretty close friends – either way, he was not in any other room of the apartment and I know that because I used the bathroom and got water from the kitchen.  I went back to my room and laid there for about 10 minutes when I heard some muffled voices in the other room and then suddenly and very distinctly heard Brian have an orgasm.

I am in a state of shock and have no idea what to think or do.  Both Brian and Alan identify as straight, though I did think that Brian was gay when I first moved in just based on his mannerisms and the fact that he is a bit on the feminine side (we also live in a very gay friendly city).  He mentions ex-girlfriends and comes from a pretty religious family, so I figured he must be straight or just not comfortable with his sexuality and either way it is his business.   It did cross my mind to wonder about my ex before, but he has always been adamant that he is straight (he’s from Spain, so with the accent I find it’s a question he gets on occasion).

So my question is, what, if anything, do I say to them???  On the one hand if Brian were female, I would be extremely angry to hear him fooling around with my ex in secret while I slept right next door.  Should I feel any differently just because he is NOT a female?  I feel betrayed by both of them for hiding this from me.  I felt like I was close with both of them and they are clearly doing this behind my back.  On the other hand, if Brian is not comfortable with his sexuality, I don’t want to force him to come out, especially since his home should be a safe place, not somewhere that he feels exposed or uncomfortable. I’m also selfishly thinking of myself and whether this would mean I would have to move out if he's uncomfortable living with me.  It’s a hard rental market in my city and finding a new apartment would be a challenge.

I finally fell back asleep after about an hour of laying in the dark with my eyes wide open.  Alan came to my bedroom at about 5 am to wake me up and say goodbye before Brian drove him to the airport and now he's gone.  I couldn’t muster more than a confused “Bye?” as he left.   Do I pretend like nothing ever happened?  Confront my ex or Brian or both?  I feel like they will deny it, but I know what I heard.  So confused!!

24378,Non-Romantic,2ud6kn,"My SO and I had a baby 2 weeks ago. My mother lives in town. Prior to the child, my relationship with her has felt strained and troubled to me.  I have some resentment towards her that I can't 100% figure out.  She is very sensitive and passive (sometimes passive aggressive) and I feel I have to walk on eggshells around her.  In addition I have had the sense on many occasions that she is intimidated by me or puts me on some kind of pedestal for some reason. My younger sister [32F] said something similar - that it feels like our mom is scared of her.  

Historically:  Our mother was a wonderful mom to babies and little children and even to teenagers but since I became an adult it feels so strained. She doesn't share anything about herself and will never give advice about my life. I don't understand what kind of relationship we are supposed to be able to have under those conditions.  

Also, my mom has a very dirty and messy house, which I am definitely triggered by.  Food is left out unrefrigerated or stuck in the fridge with no covering; lipsticks are stored open sitting on the back of the toilet; there's a weird smell when you walk into the house; it's not an environment that is pleasant to be in. I do feel resentful that I was raised in this kind of environment and have had significant struggles learning to be tidier and cleaner. It's something I still struggle with and don't want to raise my child in a similar way.

There was an incident when I got married in my early 20s (prior relationship) when I think I really hurt her feelings. I didn't want to spend the night in her dirty house before my wedding and get ready in the mess. So I arranged to stay with a friend and get ready there. My mom asked why I was staying over there, and I told her the truth. I've always felt that this comment broke her heart and wished I could have somehow handled it differently.  In recent years I tried to bring this incident up so we could talk about it.  I got a tense oh, it's fine, nothing to discuss in response.  

In a smaller but similar event, my sister turned down a 1/3 okay but 2/3 shriveled, deteriorated onion for use in a salad while at our mom's house, and our mom was totally offended and was saying tensely it's fine! it's fine! and acting like it was kind of some personal slight that my sister didn't want to eat or serve that onion.  

This seems like the time that my mom and I should be healing our relationship but I don't know how to because I prefer time without her to time with her.  Before the baby, even though we live in the same town, we could go weeks without talking and/or seeing each other.  Now that the grandchild is here, she's contacting me more frequently, which makes sense as she wants to see the baby, but it doesn't feel like we have any base friendship or relationship to support these visits.  When she comes over to see him, she just kind of sits there and gives me these awkward half-smiles and I feel so tense I want to pull my hair out.  I think she is sad that we don't have a good relationship but she will never address it, which leaves it to me, but when I have tried (with trying to bring up the wedding incident) she says everything is fine.

24402,Non-Romantic,39milb,"Throwaway because I'm a little embarrassed.

Let me preface this by describing my friendship with this girl. I have been in this group chat with 5 other girls for about a little over a year now and we've gotten very close very fast in that short time. I talk to them everyday about almost everything! 

I've gotten particularly close with one of the girls whom I will refer to as Hannah. I love spending time with her. She's funny, she's smart and she's just as highly opinionated as I am. We have lots of good times and we hang out quite often. I like her so much, that I even gave her my old job when I was moving onto a new one.

In our group chat, we (as girls) regularly joke about finding NBA husbands, looking amazing and sitting courtside one day at basketball games. However, I am actually quite the basketball fan so I take the game a little more seriously than that. 

Game 3 of the NBA Finals was looking to be an amazing game. I was at a restaurant with my boyfriend watching the game and I hopped on group chat and told the girls to tune in if they could. One of the girls (let's call her Karen) joked about not understanding what was happening so I told her to cheer for the Cavs because I *love* Lebron James.

Hannah has a reputation of being a bit of a devil's advocate (see: highly opinionated) so she immediately said, I hate Lebron. Being a Lebron fan, you kind of have to get used to hearing that so it doesn't normally phase me but this was Hannah. I didn't even know she was into basketball enough to hate a basketball player. I just asked her, Why? 

She replied with, I don't know. I just always have. I told her that Lebron is one of the most prolific players of our generation and he is amazing at what he does. She said, I'm not denying his talent. He's just a bitch. 

Surprisingly, that didn't phase me much. Usually I get pretty heated during arguments, but this time I definitely wasn't. I was just reading it on my phone while calmly eating my wings IRL. At the same time that this conversation was going on, the other girls in our group chat were talking about hot NBA players and our NBA crushes. The final thing I said was, Honestly, Lebron is a hard worker and he really does put the team on his back. Anyways, Karen, here's my current NBA crush! 

Hannah then said, Wow. Ok. and left the group chat. Everyone thought it was a joke so we added her back. Then I get a text from her that says, For the record, I don't appreciate getting cut off just because I don't agree with you. We're all entitled to our own opinions.

I had to backpedal because I didn't even know our argument was that serious. I texted her back saying, Whoa! I had to backtrack to see where I even cut you off. When I said, 'anyways Karen' I meant that as an aside...like how we always do it when we have 5 conversations going on at once. I really didn't mean for it to come off like that. A thousand, million, billion sorry's if it did!

Then she replied with, Meh. I don't really feel the need to explain why it came across to me the way it did. The 'anyways' speaks for itself.

I didn't reply to that. This was 3 days ago and I haven't logged back onto group chat because I've been too sad and I want to give her her space. I really didn't think our argument was that serious but now I think it's going to end our friendship. What should I do? I'm kind of scared to approach her but I definitely don't want to lose her as a friend. I feel like she'll be super difficult to appeal to and I'm scared that she'll accept my apology but still be cold to me. I don't know how to make it go back to the way it was. The other girls in our group chat don't know (my boyfriend doesn't even know) and I'm too embarrassed to tell them. Should I apologize again?

I'm living in America away from home for almost five years now; I've hit the good job/visa progression jackpot the way I maybe never thought I would. I've got a nice tan and am loving becoming a bit of a Yank! 

For the last few years I've been friends with a girl named Annie, who is a total delight. Just a fun, breezy, busty, smart hippie girl with tattoos and a career - the type of woman I only dreamed existed. 

My ma (60ish) is pretty typical of my home: tough, religious, demanding, and loving of her kids. My da (50s) is a kind, gentle career man. I truly hit the jackpot with my parents, they're wonderful. 

At the same time, they've been expecting me to settle down and give them a mess of grandkids; I've been having far too much fun and not quite financially secure enough to even entertain the idea of settling down. I've not had a serious girlfriend in years, which I'm fine with. 

In January, two of my brothers came over for a month and one night Annie came out with us...it was an absolute gas. At one point we just happened to find ourselves laughing and smiling and kissing...and she didn't leave my gaf for three days after that! That first day of going to work and having her be there when I got home just felt so natural. Since then it's just been wonderful. Sometimes three or four days together, sometimes not hanging out for a week. We've never discussed anything, and yet have dropped in a few I love yous. I'm not sure what's going on, but it's comfortable and nice for both of us; my brothers said it was as if we'd been together all along, the way we interacted with each other. Hell, we'd known each other since 2010 without even a stray drunken smooch before that. 

Anyways, another brother is getting married in a month and while Skyping with my da he suggested I use some of my flier miles to bring a plus one to the wedding. He's actually met Annie on a trip over and adored her; he was quite happy to hear I was bringing her (and he doesn't really know what's going on, as if I do!)

Now, my mother is a very, very traditional lady. She's SO SO SO excited to hear I'm bringing a girl home. I'm sure she's already tidying and tidying some more. She even said that we could stay in the same room, a MASSIVE deal with her. 

I'm not sure how to break the news to her that I'm hanging out with a hippie, loud, beer-drinking, bi-sexual, atheist American girl and that it's not half as serious as she thinks. I've tried explaining it away and she's just oh sure I just hope I'm lucky enough you'll give me grand kids one day! I know she comes from a place of love, but she can be tough, mean, and vindictive. While I'm sure she'll be lovely to Annie, I'm not sure how exactly to tell her it's not that serious because, well, it's not that serious! I'm pretty sure my dad is the only relationship she's ever been in. While I'm not worried about her behavior, I am very conscious of her feelings and of her values, and not quite certain how to make it clear so she understands. I'm dating an American girl with no real thoughts of making it serious seems to go in one ear and out the other. I don't particularly want any of this oh meet who I hope is my future daughter-in-law or anything like that. I'm sure she won't do that, but I KNOW in her head I'm bringing her home for approval. My mother doesn't travel, and isn't the most worldly. She will treat Annie like one of her own, of course. ...but then she'll expect to be hearing about our plans for the future with each other. She's proud of me and thinks I'm talking bollocks when I say I'm not ready to settle down. I say she's half-right, but I'll know when it's time. Growing up slowly.

Any thoughts? I know I'm a little old to be having this crop up, but she's a tough, tough lady who I've spent nearly three decades trying to keep happy. We have very different personalities and values. While she's happy if I'm happy, I really don't want to put too much pressure on something Annie and I haven't even felt the need to talk about with each other. 

Have I made a huge mistake? I just thought it would be fun. I can afford to bring her, I want to bring her, and I'm excited to bring her. I don't want to cause any friction with my mother and I can't quite find the right words so far.

She's always been my best friend. Still is. We just refrain from talking about anything to do with relationships and sex right now until we are both content about it. She's OK with being friends and understands. 

I love her to pieces. I wish so bad it could have worked. 

I met my best male friend while dating her. 

As I got to know him I started to crush on him. I still made my girlfriend #1 because I already had her and wanted her to work. But the reminder of what I wish I could have with a man ultimately made me realize I need to leave her.

He's helped me shower when I'm drunk, picked me up when I was stranded, hung out with me as much as he could when I first broke up with my girlfriend, taken me to a gay bar before I knew anyone else, sat with me at our college lgbt club, hugged me when I'm crying. 

He's had girlfriends, and yes it makes me upset a bit, but I'm also incredibly happy for him. I always give advice to benefit him and try to help him find girlfriends. But I understand he's straight. Has never stopped how he acts and treats me. His girlfriends usually just call me his boyfriend and laugh about us.

She behaves this way 90% of the time and can be a nice person, but I feel that there's deeper issues going on. My relationship with my mother has been troubled since I was 11. She frequently puts me and other family members down for no reason whatsoever and after a while it becomes too much. She regularly tells me that I'm going nowhere in life, that I'm a loner who has no friends (which is false) and that the reason I haven't got a job yet is because they think I'm too fat. She is just a constant negative ball of energy, often telling me that I'm going nowhere in life and praising my friends for taking an academic route and being more successful when she knows I'm studying a degree. She will say the most venomous things to her family and never apologise, but if I say something to her and apologise she never lets me forget what I said. These are just some of the things she does almost every day, if I were to list everything we would be here forever. On many occasions I have wanted to end my life, and after researching methods online I did overdose on some iron supplements with the intention to end my life but I didn't take enough and woke up the next morning. I do still get suicidal thoughts to escape my family life, since I feel that if I wasn't there their family life would be simpler and my mother wouldn't act the way she does. My mother's behaviour is affecting our family life, my dad has high blood pressure and I'm worried that she will be the reason he ends up in hospital. I've tried to get her to see a therapist before but she just laughed at me and viewed it as me showing disrespect. Sometimes I do argue back with her to defend myself, but she always outsmarts me with sarcastic quips that make me feel really stupid for even trying. I want to have a good relationship with her, I don't want to be the type of person who ends up excluding her from my wedding or cutting her off from her grandchildren. However she does not want to get help, so I'm lost. If anyone has any advice or suggestions, they'd be greatly appreciated.

Anyway, since the beginning of her start in our company I've noticed some bruising. Everyone has known since day one she has a boyfriend because she never misses to mention him and how they've been together for years.

Week 1 in the business I notice some bruising on her face. It looked like a hickey... on her cheek. I jokingly asked if her boyfriend had done that to her and she said yes, he beat me. I was stunned. Not only was I not expecting that kind of answer or assuming that it in fact was physical abuse, but the way she said it was so nonchalant. I thought it was a joke and then didn't receive a just kidding. That's when I noticed the bruising under her eye, covered up by makeup. I also saw some on her arms. She's a darker girl so the bruising isn't as obvious, but it was still noticeable.  She notices my face and then says, it's all okay, he just has some anger management issues he's working on and he's apologized profusely. Then, she walks away. At this point in time, I don't know her well enough to pry. We're in a professional setting and so it was left at that for a while.

Fast forwards a few months, we're friends. We hang out after work, we talk on a regular basis. She's opened up to me and I to her. Out of the blue one day, my boyfriend of a couple years breaks things off with me. I work 80 hour weeks so friends outside of work have been difficult to keep in touch with. She's become the person i go to for things. As I'm telling her my situation, she breaks down into tears.

The boyfriend hasn't spoken to her in 2 weeks. The longest they've ever gone without talking has been 2 days. She tells me how she's called him repeatedly 60 times in a row the day before and he does not pick up. I had known they were having more issues than before and was secretly happy they were done so he would get out of her life for good. That night, we turn our phones off and go out. As we're out she really opens up about the abuse. I know that in abusive relationships, the abuse always starts off small and then ends up escalating. We talk about the escalation of abuse in their relationship but she keeps making excuses how he has finally gotten help for his anger management. He has done 3 weeks of sessions with a therapist and he's a changed man. The entire time she's taking the blame for why he isn't speaking to her anymore. I tell her how it only gets worse and that sure, he may grovel at her feet like he does after he hits her and blames it on his anger issues but it's still not okay that it happens. On top of being physically abusive, he's extremely mentally abusive. She tells me how he's constantly calling her derogatory names and holds back from having sex with her for weeks. We end the night with me building her up a little more but I know she's still thinking about him and hoping that they'll get back together.
 
Last Sunday, the day after Valentines Day I'm checking out my Snapchats. I notice she's posted one for all her friends to watch. Lo and behold... they're together again. They look like they're having fun and she looks happy.

The NEXT day, on Monday she comes into the office and her face is ALL bruised up. Black eyes, on her forehead, and on her lips. All covered up with makeup, yet still extremely noticeable. At this point I can't even mention it. She looks at me and says she doesn't want to talk about it. I just give her a hug and tell her if she needs to talk, I'm there for her when she's ready.

We have at work what's called team night. We go out on Thursdays to a bar to bond and get away from the hectic business lives. We're all enjoying ourselves when she suddenly disappears and then reappears with the monster. Clearly, she doesn't introduce him to me, she just takes him to the back of the bar where they hang out with a couple of other colleagues of ours that are all in the dark with what's happening. I found out one other female colleague of ours knows about her situation. We figured it out because of how we found each other staring at him. Anyway, my friend goes up to my other colleague and I catch her saying, you don't even know the extent of it... i have cuts on my abdomen and all over my body...

Reddit, I have no clue what to do. Is there anything I can do? I realize nothing can be done if she doesn't want anything to be done about it, but I'm in denial. This woman is so bright and loving, yet she can't break free from this hoodlum POS in her life. Do I just sit around and do nothing and just be there for her to talk to or what? It breaks my heart because no one should ever have to go through that and if something even worse happens to her, I will forever feel extreme guilt if I didn't do something when I could.

Let me elaborate, I'll start with his positive traits:


- He's charismatic and really interesting to talk to. I've had lots of interesting and cool conversations with him, he has quite a unique perspective on things.


- He's generally friendly and helpful, often goes out of his way to help people.

- Extremely confident, has no sense of social anxiety at all.



Now, here come the negative traits, which I didn't really notice until I'd known him for quite a while:


- He lies. A lot. Not just white lies either, I'm talking completely fabricating stuff about his past. Things like claiming to invent things he obviously didn't invent, giving versions of events that are the complete opposite of what happened, shit like that. And he lies with such confidence that he can make ridiculous shit sound almost believable.


- Steals stuff for no apparent reason. Like, not even stuff of value. For example, he stole a broken stereo off a mutual friend then blatantly lied about having stolen it. Still can't understand why he did that.


- Randomly acts really nasty and mean for no apparent reason. Like, he'll just get in a bad mood and start insulting me. Which is weird cause most of the time he's really friendly and cool.


- Fearless to the point of recklessness. I'm kinda surprised he hasn't killed himself in a car accident or something. Don't get me wrong, he's a skilled driver but I've seen him take some INSANE risks.


- Extreme arrogance. Always thinks he's right, will never admit to being wrong.


- Oh yeah, one last thing... he's constantly in trouble with the law. Going to court is a regular event for this guy. But it's never his fault, it's always the system fucking him over. I don't know how he does it but he manages to attract drama into his life like some kind of magnet.



Anyway, I think you get the picture. The thing is, I'm conflicted. On one hand, I do care about this guy and we've had some great times together. We've had lots of interesting conversations. I'd say he's one of the most interesting and unique people I've ever met.

But he's just so insane I don't know if I can deal with having him in my life. Like I said, he's a drama magnet and he has a way of pulling me into his dramas too.


I haven't been in contact with him for a few months now, and I'm debating whether or not to go see him and catch up with him.


What do you guys make of all this? Do you think he has an actual mental disorder? I just cant understand how someone can be so friendly and cool in some ways and totally insane in other ways!?

24533,Non-Romantic,2ndyud,"Backstory: I (M/27) was born and raised to a very conservative family that values money and social status over all else. Fun family dynamic time: my father is a doctor and a textbook narcissist. He will ridicule, put down, and hassle people over their weight, looks, career choices (important), socioeconomic status, race (important), sexual orientation (important), etc. My mother was raised in a privileged family and is more or less a junkie who supposedly has every terminal illness known to man, regardless of the fact that nearly every single symptom she has can be attributed to one of the dozens of meds she is taking. My sister and I didn’t use to get along so well (I’m a nerd on several levels and she was (at least, I thought back in high school) a typical “mean girl”), but recent things have driven us closer together than ever before. I pretty much raised my brother (10 years younger than me) until I was 17, despite the “privilege.” I’ve been the black sheep in the family (more left-wing (although it’s hard to be less than them), don’t really care about status or money (although I have a rather decent job as a software engineer, so money isn’t an issue), and try to follow my heart.

---

My wife (F/27) is a powerful force of nature (one of the many reasons I was attracted to her in the first place). She’s stunningly gorgeous, outgoing, funny, smart (she managed to snag a higher GPA than me), and very strong in her values and beliefs. She believes in helping those in need above all else, and values her family and her heritage (she’s 1/4 Cherokee, and that side of her family has been her closest). She also happens to be bisexual (well, pansexual, but, you know). She will debate to the end of time for the things she believes, but she was raised to “not take no shit off nobody, no how.” If someone is out of place, she’ll tell them. It’s worked very well for her as a therapist, another very respectful position that earns a pretty penny (I’ve mentioned money in here a few times; it’s important), even though all of her clients are in the ghetto and deal with problems most of us middle-class folks don’t usually deal with (parents killed in a drug deal, etc). Her family is very close, and they’ve felt more like a family to me in the past 10 years than mine ever has.

---

Well, upon first meeting my father (we were both 16, going on 17 (**snicker**)), he asked what she wanted to do with her life (one of his favorite lines), and she told him how she wanted to be a therapist, or possibly a plastic surgeon. He told her she wouldn’t amount to anything as a pseudoscientist and needed to stick with the MD role. If she went the therapist route, he’d make more in a week than she would in a year. He’s an anesthesiologist, not a neurosurgeon, so that’s highly unlikely. Well, as one could imagine, that didn’t sit well with her. He took us to Florida on vacation a bout a year later, and as she bent over, he took a picture of her belly and proceeded to laugh at and share the picture. She obviously didn’t take well to this. She hasn’t forgotten these, and I know damn well she hasn’t forgiven. He constantly brings up politics, Native American (or lazy injuns, as he likes to say) issues, ridiculing gays, etc. For what purpose, I don't know. She's convinced it's to instigate arguments. She may be right.

This had planted a seed in her for not liking him very much (understandable), but she put up with him for years. Until a few weeks ago.

He posted some comment on Facebook (rarely happens, as he doesn’t use it much) about something political, to which she snapped, and called him a narcissistic asshole. Yesterday, I received a series of texts:

How can one that's posts 230 selfies on My Space call me Narcissistic? Jesus. I am so pissed. I have never done one thing to her. Never. Does she hate me just because I'm a conservative? Because I have paid more than 2 million in taxes in the last ten years? So the asshole in the White House can spend it on golf and vacations? I love u Mike but u picked her and married her. So, I have no further desire to ever see or hear from fer again. I'm done. 

She owes me an apology. A sincere one. A big one.

Truth is, I rarely ever invite anyone over. I’m a highly self-conscious person and I feel if people see my house, they’ll ridicule something. So people rarely come over. I bought this nice house, had plans for a speak-easy, etc. without thinking about how I’d never invite anyone over :/ . But I digress. My sister and I planned for the two of us, our spouses/kids, and my brother to have Thanksgiving at our house Saturday, so there’s something. We wanted to keep it down to just the few of us, to keep down the crazy.

---

I’ve suffered with ADHD and chronic depression for the better part of my life, and am finishing up a second bachelor's degree (first one was in biochemistry to go be a doctor like my parents wanted me to do so badly (shit, I remember when I told my mom that I might want to be a PA instead and she held her face in her hands, shook her head, and went “no… no… no…”)) in software development, all while holding down a job as a software engineer and renovating our fixer-upper. I’m stressed to the max, and this is one straw on the camel’s back that adding to the stress, anxiety, and depression. I’ve had issues with attempted suicide before (thanks dad for giving me a shotgun, why the hell did you do that), and the thoughts are coming back, which scares the hell out of me. 

---

I don’t care about the will. It drives me up the fucking wall that it’s being used as an ultimatum. I have enough money to be happy. I don’t need more. I just want to make video games, do some voice acting on the side, and be a freelance graphic designer. And I want to be the best damn husband that I can be. I’ve already had issues with my mother where my sister and I had to stop being her crutch for her addictions. My family is insistent on causing drama where it doesn’t need to be, and I certainly don’t need it, myself.

---

So what do? I used to go to a therapist, and I’m tempted to go back once this semester is over (I graduate this semester, so there’s that). I’m near the point where I’m about to cut out any and all family ties to get away from the crazy. I love my family, but I can’t handle this. It’s not like I don’t love/like my parents. They drive me nuts, sure, but I used to be able to talk to my mom for hours on end about anything and everything (like I do with my wife now), and my dad and I share a passion for performance autos and fixing things. He paid my way through college the first time, and offered to again whenever he learned of my depression. He does care about me, but he has a hard time seeing himself accurately from another’s perspective, I think.

24535,Non-Romantic,2ex6ro,"I'm flying back to Ohio for a week today for a family reunion on my Dads side and for my boyfriends friends wedding. My dad decided to pay for plane tickets for a round trip all on his own. As much as I appreciate his help in getting me there and back I know it was for selfish reasons because he never wanted me to move to North Carolina. He fought me the whole way and still wants me to move back. My boyfriend lives in Ohio and, while he is planning to move down here in the next couple of months, I only have 2 days out of the whole week to see him (the wedding and today) since he works 2 jobs and that's all he'll be doing most of the time.

I had asked my dad weeks ago if it was okay if I went out the day I got in but if they had anything planned for me that I didn't want to step on his toes. He said it wasn't a problem because he has to referee a game tonight and won't be back until midnight and that i'll just be hanging out anyway. He said if I was going to be out late that I should just stay the night so I'm not waking him or his girlfriend up.


He told me he wasn't sure who was picking me up from the airport and he never updated me. My dad is know for his unreliability and last minute info so I asked my boyfriend to pick me up and if I could stay at his place that night so I can spend as much time with him as I can. The family reunion is tomorrow and my dad invited him to go so he got off work to go and meet my dad and the rest of the family. I told my dad a few days ago what the plan was but that I was staying with my sister because I wanted to avoid any awkward sex talk for both our sakes. 


When I told my dad he started arguing with me about it. He told me that his girlfriend needed help with party and that I hardly know my boyfriend and that I only need my dad. He started saying that he paid to fly me down there and I have all week to see my boyfriend which I don't and I explained to him. He let down on me and I offered for my and boyfriend to go early before the party to help set up But my dad said he could get me an hour early and have my boyfriend show up an hour later. 


He keeps inquiring where I am staying and I'm going to tell him but I don't want him to keep pushing me and making me feel bad for spending time with my boyfriend. I want to do the right thing and compromise but I don't know how when no ones giving me anything to work with.

A month or so after, we begin talking to each other at work to find we have a lot of common interests (one of them being video games).  We begin talking a lot at work and after work while playing games while using Skype.  We start to become very good friends and start spending the night at each others' houses.  I was a bit of a clam in middle +  high school, so finding someone my age with similar interests who is easy to bond with felt good.

Two or so months ago a girl got hired to our work that was our age.  A very good looking girl who I admired immediately got hired and began working there.  After a couple of weeks the girl and I made plans to canoe / kayak down the river with each other.  She seemed pretty excited as was I and it felt like a date.  I told Ted about the good news and my feelings for the girl (at this point we feel like pretty good friends and he seems trustworthy).  He seemed to have no interest in her until a month ago when I left for a family reunion which caused me to leave for a week.  While gone, I open a Snap Chat from Ted of the two of them sitting in his car on the beach with the caption You wish you were cool like us ;)  I assume this was to all of his friends and he probably didn't mean to send it to me.  It made me feel bad, but I brushed it off and when I returned home there didn't seem to be any indications of a relationship between the two of them.

Last week though, on a outing with friends from work, they were very close to each other and seemed to ignore everyone else but each other.  I feel like something happened while I was gone and feel betrayed by Ted.  Should I ignore it, or confront him?  Find different friends?

24554,Non-Romantic,2lb288,"I don't know where else to post this. I'm hoping I can find someone who has gone through similar who can offer words of comfort or advice for dealing through this. 

I live in Europe with my fiancée but my whole family is from North America. My parents are divorced and my dad lived on the west coast (mom and siblings on east). He worked and lived by himself. 

I got a call at 12am last night before bed from my sister crying saying that I needed to come home asap. I knew immediately something was wrong with my dad and she broke the news they'd found him dead in his apartment. By 3am my fiancée and I were already at the airport. 

Having to go through a transatlantic flight while dealing with these new surges of emotions was the worst. Thankfully my fiancée was extremely supportive. 

I'm wrecked with guilt because a month prior, my dad got married and I was back home for his wedding. We got into a fight the day before I left and I barely even said bye to him at the airport, I shrugged and rolled my eyes at him and walked off. I had no idea it would be the last time I would see him. 
Then the month between my leaving and yesterday, I didn't bother once to talk to my dad. I was holding a grudge over our fight and I was hoping he would message me first and apologize. I was being a butthurt child. I felt bad about not having  talked for so long (while trash talking him to my fiancée the whole duration of the silent treatment) that I sent him a text message early yesterday afternoon asking if he was going to ask how I was anytime soon. 

He supposedly had a stroke and died while at his computer desk in his apartment either late Saturday night or early Sunday (Saturday was last anyone had contact with him). They didn't find him until Monday when he didn't show up at work. 

I am so upset at myself for being such a child. This has put everything in perspective. I didn't even tell him I loved him. We yelled at each other and that's the last memory of the last day we shared. I complained about him constantly to my fiancée. I am so blown away that 24 hours ago I was in Europe stressing over something that seems so minor now and now I'm back home dealing with the terrible thing that is arranging a funeral and planning to get his body sent from the west coast over to us in the east.

I hadn't gotten the chance to visit him yet. I wanted to explore the city he lived in. I'm getting married in a year (still early planning) and now I'll be fatherless and I won't have a dad to walk me down the aisle. The thought of asking anyone else to do something my dad so badly wanted to do, makes me miserable. 

He'll never meet his grandchildren. He was so excited about having grandchildren. He was planning to come spend Christmas with me and fiancée in Europe this year and now it isn't happening. I can't wrap my head around this. 

I've been trying to distract myself and it works to keep me calm but I'm breaking down crying randomly and I just can't believe this is real. My father. I loved him even if he was flawed. And now I won't get to see him again. 

I'm plagued with thoughts of him dying alone and in pain. Do strokes make you suffer? Was he aware he was suffering and dying? All I'm thinking of is his final moments alone and in pain in his room with no one there. 

I just don't know how to get by. I had my future set for the next few years and my dad was going to play a big part in it and now it's like a main character is missing. The fact this funeral thing is going to take up to a couple weeks to get arranged is killing me. I do not want to bury my dad. 

For anyone who's gone through similar, would you say a viewing with open casket is a bad idea? I don't want to regret not looking at his face again but I also don't want my last image of him to be his lifeless body in a casket.

24580,Non-Romantic,2rzixn,"I dont know where to start so Ill try to give a bit of family history as briefly as I can.
I always dread going back for the holidays because home has never really been a happy place since as far as I remember. My parents constantly had screaming matches that sometimes turned physical (Throwing pots and pans or whatever else there was, and my mother being held to the floor by my father for what seemed like several hours. I remember how the phone would ring and he'd answer it like nothing, while still holding her to the ground with a free arm). When I got older it turned into me fighting them. Constant screaming matches, mom taking swings at me, and us getting into hitting matches after she ALWAYS initiated them. I won't say that I was the best kid, I admittedly had emotional problems (I WONDER WHY?) but I never did drugs and stayed out of trouble for the most part. Even back then I HATED coming back home after school. Constantly fought up until I finally moved out at 23 to attend university. Also, they are paying for almost everything right now since they've always insisted on the condition that I am in school. I feel like there is a trend with them where $ = love.

Over the time period of visiting for Christmas we got into another big fight. (No surprise there). It really began when my mom thought 1:30 in the morning was a great time to come in and start nagging about school, which always puts me on the defense because she's so aggressive and I happened to be in the middle of a game on the computer. So she starts to blow up at me about school and 1:30am and storms off. After several minutes my father comes in to inform me its bedtime and we of course fight about it because 1)Im on break and don't have a schedule 2)Im fucking 25?. They've always had this bizarre obsession of me going to bed when they want me to, we fight about it almost every time I visit. So this turns into them talking shit about me within earshot in the mornings for several hours the next two days. They hate each other but seem to really united and become best friends when it comes to their mutual resentment of me. Just thinking about the shit they were saying makes me want to cry. Everything from what happened that night to the most irrelevant and made up shit about me.  

So naturally I feel very uncomfortable and avoid my mother which leads to her bursting into my room and asking me why Im mad at HER. And seems unapologetic when I tell her I could hear them for the past couple of days and just says Well that's how I feel. Screaming match begins and I dont remember much and I left for the remaining days until my flight home.

Im pretty dependent on them at the moment, as they've (I hate to admit) spoiled and controlled me. I really want to change that but its hard when Im almost done with school but there are a few steps I've already started looking into. But since this cant happen immediately we arent talking and I have hardly enough money to eat and use the bus (I live in a large city where having a car is slightly impractical).

Sorry if this post seems incomplete, it's really hard to put everything together neatly when I feel pretty emotional and there is just so much to include.

Apologies in advance for the long post, and a big thank you to those taking the time out of their day to read this.  


**Background:** My family is not in the best financial state. My father is struggling to rise up to his desired position at his current place of work, making my mother the breadwinner of the family. However, her work is physical and has affected her body tremendously. Her arm is virtually unbearable to use and she is constantly in pain. Her business is also new; she is unable to make as much money as we would need to live leisurely.  


I have a difficult relationship with them as a result of cultural differences and problems communicating (largely because of language barriers).  
I grew up raised by my brother, who is 6 years my senior. He is currently attending college/graduate school several states away.  


Also, if it's of any importance, I am female and Korean. 

**Problem:** I recently had a big birthday. I had the opportunity to go and visit my brother, which was initially unrelated. However, after several conversations with my parents I realized they wanted to plan something special and big for my birthday. Knowing we wouldn't be able to afford it, and not really wanting something huge (I'm not really that kind of person) I decided to go and visit my brother, making sure I would be there on the day of my birthday.  
As he has a job, I knew my parents would be satisfied with sending me there (they would be happy/confident with what my brother would do for me). I also looked forward to spending some time with my brother, sharing some laughs, watching a couple movies, kicking back and having fun.  


The entire week I was with my brother, we did not have one meal alone.  


He has a girlfriend [21?F] he has been with for 6 years, who I have had little problems with the time I have known her. She followed him to his city for college, and as far as I know they spend a good amount of time together, going on dates at least twice a week and seeing each other on a regular basis.  
I did not expect that she and her roommate would be included in everything my brother and I did together.  
Now I would not have had any issue if it had been a couple times, but everywhere we went, they came.  
And they fought.  
Quite a bit.  


As the week went on and my birthday passed, and we gave up doing things I was promised we were to do because the girls didn't feel like it, I grew more and more dissatisfied.  
I have no gripes with my brother's girlfriend as a person. However, as a fit for my brother, I disagree.  
She has rather expensive taste (expects a higher standard, seemed unhappy when we went to eat at a lower class buffet rather than a pricey restaurant), which contrasts with the upbringing of my brother and myself.  
She is... ah.. ditzy? Preppy, so to say.. Just ah.. you get the jist of it.  Extremely argumentative over small things (I feel she disrespects my brother, which may be more of my issue because I was raised to never challenge his authority).  
I feel that she generally only has her own interest in mind unless she is told to consider someone else's.  
There are a myriad of other reasons.


I would be disappointed in myself for picking at these things, because my family is very critical - if someone's SO is not approved of, they will be ostracized or criticized heavily. I didn't want to be the person criticizing my brother's relationship, but two things negated this.  
1.) My brother picks at my very happy relationship because of a big mistake I made that resulted in my mother and him disliking my SO. So, if he gets to pick on my relationship just because he doesn't like my boyfriend, why can't I pick on his flawed relationship?  
2.) I wouldn't dare call his relationship flawed if he hadn't told me himself he was not happy in the relationship for the reasons I mentioned above. (which he has. he expressed his desire of wanting to end the relationship, but told me that after so long it would be like a divorce - tied financials, shared possessions, etc.)


My major issue is that I feel like I was treated a bit poorly. I see my brother two/three times a year, and all I wanted was to spend a bit of quality time with my closer parent figure in a time of distress back at home. All I got was arguments, drama and tension, and seemingly more attention and consideration being given to his girlfriend than me.  


He did a good amount for me, yes, I got a wonderful (expensive!!) birthday brunch and had a great time, but I feel a bit sour.  
Am I being whiny and selfish?

24596,Non-Romantic,2kxfrs,"I met my friend (Sofie) through college, we've been friends now for about five years. At the start I had a crush on her but nothing really came of it, and she started dating one of my friends (James). I was living with James too at the time and she'd come over now and again, all three of us always got on well and we decided to live together the following year. We lived together for two years, then things with James and her took a turn for the worst and they were fighting all the time towards the end of the relationship. I didn't openly take any sides but I sided with Sofie at the end, as James was treating her like shit. Spending all her money, possibly cheating and generally being a douche.

Towards the end of lease, Sofie and I became really close and enjoyed being alone together in the house as it was way more relaxing. We used to talk for hours and get on really great. When the lease was up, I moved home, she moved out and James stayed in the house. They had went through a messy break up and James said he no longer wanted to speak to me over not cleaning the house properly on my last day. I think he just wanted an excuse to cut me out of his life and make that clear. I didn't really care as I had no intentions on talking to him anyways.

A few weeks went by and I was checking in with Sofie, she took things really badly and was feeling like shit. We started to hang out a lot as she told me she was really lonely and it seemed to help her to talk through things. As the weeks went on, we started spending a lot more time together. It was really fun and I began to develop a crush on her again. We just really liked being together and we always had a good time together.

She was dropping hints a lot that I should move back and said she misses me a lot. She said if I came back I'd have to show her how to play computer games properly and she missed watching football matches with me, so she said she'd go to the pub with me for every game if I came back. When I told her I was thinking about moving back, she got super excited. Offered to help me look for places, said I could stay at hers while looking and she'd cut me a key, just seemed really keen on having me around and being around me.

The next week I messaged her to say I'd be in her city for a few hours, if she wanted to grab a coffee. She didn't reply. I messaged her an hour before she finished work to say 'me and [mutual friend of ours] are thinking of getting food, you want to join us after work?'. She texted back 'ok sure'. She just seemed really distant, I tried to involve her in the conversation but she spent a lot of time on her phone. 

She has become a lot more distant in the last two weeks. Normally she'd reply to texts and messages but lately its really hard to talk to her. Anytime I talk to her on Facebook or text, she doesn't really make conversation and lets the chat die a lot. Sometimes she just doesn't reply. She ignores more messages now than she answers (I'd message her maybe once or twice a week at most, no more than I would talk to any other friend) , so I'm starting to get the hint. I just don't know what the problem is. We have the same circle of friends and she seems fine with everyone else. Anytime I'm in town, I text a few friends to see if they want to grab lunch or coffee. Everyone else replies if they can or can't make it, if they can't they try to make it work by suggesting another time or asking how long I'm here for. She just either ignores the message, or says no or gives a vague non-committal answer that I don't really push. She went from being super excited about hanging out and me moving back to the same city to seemingly not caring at all now. I was going to move anyways but I'd be lying if I didn't say that hanging out with her more was a big positive to moving back. Things I thought were moving in a good direction, even just as friends. Now it seems rather flat and dead. I don't really know what to do from here. 

My own personal opinion is either that

a) she met a new guy or possibly seeing her ex again. She had a really bad habit of only focusing on her boyfriend, to the stage where I was about her only other friend. I tried really hard to convince her go out with our friends again, and re-build relationships. So if she was dating someone new, it wouldn't surprise me if she couldn't be arsed with other friendships again.

b) One of our friends might have asked her if we were dating and she got freaked out. The same friend asked me because he has a crush on her but it wouldn't surprise me if he asked her too, I said nothing was going on between us, we were just friends.

c) She's depressed. This is what would worry me, she told me she's really lonely and in the past her response is to isolate herself because she doesn't want to talk to people. I don't really want to make any assumptions though that's the reason she's not talking to me.

I'd be kinda hurt if she stopped wanting to hang out just because she's dating a guy or just because our friends think something is going on.

For starters, I've posted on reddit before asking for advice and I got some, but I'm back again because I have no where else to go and I need to vent.

I've been through a lot in the past three and a half years and I went through a really personal stage where I felt I was walking around without the ability to actually truly love anything. This was because I was in an abusive relationship and as it started to evaporate, my feelings went with it, I guess. 

I realized that the first person I dated afterwards was more of a distraction and an emotional filler. I was kindof stuffing myself with feelings I didn't want in order to make myself feel better, and then it ended, and I lingered for about two months not really giving a fuck but giving to many fucks all at once. 

About three months ago, I met someone that I instantly clicked with. I hadn't felt that much chemistry or emotion since I met my abusive SO. I obviously acted on it, and we've been dating for three amazing months exactly. He is absolutely devoted to me. I love him completely, more Than I ever thought I could again. He's My soulmate, which is where mum comes in.

He knew he loved me from the start, and made it clear that he wanted to marry me. I made it clear that I would be his wife, but I that I wanted to wait a while to make sure it's what we both wanted and that we would be able to handle it. My mother is skeptical, as mothers are, but to the point where it's really unfair. I can't tell her anything without her acting like she's ultimately more skilled in love than I am, when really neither of us are. 

I brought up the financially resilient idea of very slowly saving up money and materials for our wedding once we get engaged, instead of cramping it all into a year long process, that way we don't go ultimately broke and lose any chance of the wedding we want. I was only being thoughtful. My mother, upon hearing this, replied Roo, what is love? Do you even know what love is? In the most condescending, degrading, manner she could have possibly retorted with. It honestly crushed me. All dramaticism aside. 

I just wanted her support. He makes me happy, reddit. I can't even talk to my mom about someone who actually makes me happy that I have to gleaming opportunity to share my life with. I'm 17 and he's 17 but we both don't have very complex dreams, and I'm supportive of all the ones he has and will have, as long as he's happy. And I know marriage is A very serious thing to consider.

24626,Non-Romantic,2emv7v,"I used to like my brother in law, but as time's worn on I just get the feeling that I don't like him at all. In fact, I'm starting to have feelings of actual hatred towards him.

He's been with my sister for over a decade and they have a kid together. My sister is a really smart chick, she's very headstrong and stubborn as hell - she and I are extremely different, and yet we're cut from the same cloth. We had/have creative, bright, intelligent parents.

Initially I liked him. I thought he was funny and he made my sister laugh and kept her happy which was great. But as time's worn on, I can see what he's like as a person. Sure, he's funny and has a good sense of humour. But he's also not at all practical and can't do anything for my sister around the house (personally, I'd feel like this would make me less of a man, and I'd want to learn more... but not him), he can't really cook, he seems incapable of holding down a job or earning good money (he has relied on a lot of payouts from his wealthy mother and father), and when we've worked together he's behaved like such an idiot that I'm never going to involve him with my projects ever again. He was demanding, unreasonable, uncommunicative, stubborn and generally useless. He just doesn't seem very intelligent either and I loath stupidity. It makes me think of him as a lesser man! Lame, bullshit feeling I know.

I have zero respect for him. We were all out to dinner, and my sister had her daughter on her lap but was also trying to eat her meal. Everyone else had finished their food apart from her. After seeing that she was struggling for a few moments, I offered to help - I offered to either cut up her meal so she could fork it with one hand, or hold the baby so she could tuck in. She opted for the former and I was immediately furious with her husband. How dare he not offer to help? It just cemented the idea that he's oblivious to her needs and all she's doing is getting used to it, his behaviour seeming normal to her.

This shit happened AGAIN at a function. I stood there for a couple of minutes waiting for him to do something, and he did nothing, so I stepped in again to help. Seems very simple.

Worth noting, of course, my sister loves him. This is disregarding the fact that he once cheated on her - she lived with me for 6 months during the fallout, and not once did he approach me and apologise to me or try and talk to me about it. He never thanked me for helping out either. They patched it up and she forgave him, and with time I shrugged that off too.

Anyway, I don't know what to do. I can just about tolerate him, but in avoiding any kind of contact with him, and also losing some respect for my sister because I feel that she's with a sub-standard guy, I'm missing out on time with my niece. I also feel like I don't particularly appreciate the idea that his behaviour and lack of substance will be passed on to my niece and just feel a crushing disappointment that I don't have a brother in law I want to hang out with more. How do you deal with a situation like this, and what are the easiest ways of learning to spend time with someone you feel like you might dislike to the point of having some hate for them?

24638,Non-Romantic,2qr76a,"My best friend, bless her, is the kind of person who has always needed a man in her life, even when we were in high school. Even when the guys were abusive towards her, hit her, made her do their homework for them, had her move in with them... all that stuff. I was always the one to pull her back from the edge, to get her to call the police, to hide her at my house from her abusive boyfriends, even when they drove by my house with friends repeatedly in a way I thought was threatening.

I talked my parents into letting her stay with us, and I lent her money when her asshole boyfriends kicked her out. (The minute she moved in with a boyfriend at 17, her mom moved away to another city). She started ditching school because she was so depressed, so I brought her homework to her. She just barely graduated - when we had started being friends, she was a straight-A student.

After high school, I went off to college, finished school, and I now work as a healthcare professional. She works at Wal-Mart as an assistant manager, and a serial monogamist with guys that have always hurt her, let her down, or held her back from trying to get a better life. We've still tried as best as we can to stay in touch and spend time together.

Now, we're 25. The last time we saw each other, she told me over lunch that she was sleeping with a married man, her boss at work who is a kid. He swears up and down that he is unhappy in his marriage, that he only stays with his wife because she is a psycho who might keep his daughter away from him if he leaves her, and that he has never loved anyone like he loves my friend.

We were watching some chick flick and eating some Chinese takeout for lunch on my couch, and she starts bawling about how she's afraid that she won't be able to experience all the things in the movie like getting married and having a baby together.

Then, she comes out and asks what I think about her seeing a married man, and wants me to agree with her belief that everything this guy says is true.

Now me, I'm happily married, so I tell her I have to be honest with her - I don't see anything good coming of her being the other woman. I tell her, Of course he's going to say his wife is a psycho, because you won't feel bad about stealing a psycho's husband. You'd feel bad if he said, 'oh, my wife is a perfectly nice person!' - I don't trust this guy.

She suddenly begins going off on me about how I don't want her to be happy, and how I'm not a true friend to her, how I'm fake and judgmental. Plus some other colorful language I probably won't elaborate on.

And then, she storms out. We haven't spoken in over 2 months, and I miss my best friend. We're in different places in our lives, sure. But I miss her.

24644,Non-Romantic,2dfqkl,"Note: Firstly I'd like to apologise for the length and poor structure of this. It's been on my mind for nearly a year and I'm struggling to put it all together coherently.

**A little background to begin with**

I've been with my partner for 18 months, we moved in with each other fairly swiftly at about 7 months in, and things have been going wonderfully. We're each others best friends and are very happy together. We intend to get married in the future, maybe when we're about 25 ish. It's not something we're talked about in a lot of detail, but it's definitely on both of our plans for the future.

**The problem**

I have a really big hang-up over his mother, let's just call her T. You hear all these horror stories about evil MILs (mother in law), and I don't want to be involved with a person like this, but I don't really know what to do about it.

Last February, my partner pulled a prank/semi-social experiment where he doctored a lottery ticket to make it look like he'd won. I was never involved in it- no status or picture involved me, I didn't want any part of it but I was still very interested in the results.

We found it entertaining as to how many girls added him to their facebook friends list in comparison to guys, and the kinds of things that were said to him- this is the kind of material we were interested in seeing. Obviously no-one really experiences this, it was an interesting experiment, and after 24 hours he stated publically that it was just a joke- we hadn't actually won.

Most people conceded 'aah you're such a prankster', except for a select few- T, and T's friends who all shot him down for being 'selfish' and 'disrespectful' to his family.

T sent him a very, very long email which was really quite abusive in manner- saying a load of stuff like 'I brought you up better than this you need to treat me with respect, all the support I gave you when you were younger and this is how you treat me', calling him 'selfish' and suggesting that he is 'desperate for attention for pulling a stunt like that'. A lot of it was also in between the lines aimed at me; the first thing the email said was 'read this alone.' He lived with me at this point. 

Read this alone means 'don't let ijustmadeyoubreathe read it'. There was a lot of 'I think the people that you are mixing with (aka me) have made you change for the worse, you are very rude and selfish now', and other things to that effect. I felt pretty sad about this- I don't want to see a rift between him and T, much less be the reason for it. I've only ever treated this woman with respect- she'd given me no reason to dislike her, though her mannerisms could sometimes be a little abrasive and pushy, I don't tend to judge people over little things like that. However for her to try and blame me for my SOs and T's relationship failing, I really resent that. I feel as if she's using me as a scapegoat.

T used my SO's close relationship with his grandparents to try and guilt trip into admitting he'd done wrong. T stated that his grandmother was 'shocked to tears' and his grandfather was very 'upset and disappointed'. Independently, his grandparents contacted him and were not upset or disappointed in him- they didn't seem to be affected by it at all...Hmm.

She is generally one of those blameless people, constantly accusing my SO of being 'just like his dad', whom his mother split up with when SO was 2. He's since rekindled a relationship with his father, who isn't as poisonous as T painted him to be through all of my SO's formative years. His father has been very generous, supportive and helpful towards us as we moved into our new place 2 months ago.

He has said for our entire relationship and also before, how much he hates the way T talks to him and treats him, and of the arguments they would have almost daily. It's as if she has this expectation that he will treat her like some sort of royalty, whilst T's allowed to talk down to him and talk shit to him without any kind of repercussion. It really smacks of narcissism. He has posted before in /r/raisedbynarcissists for advice and support dealing with her.

Of his own volition, my SO stopped talking to T since February (when this whole thing kicked off), and all of her friends teamed up to tell zak how bad he's been. They of course only know her side (oh poor me, my son is an asshole look how he's treating me), without seeing the offensive and insulting emails that my SO found very hurtful.

All from a small joke that lasted only 1 day and was completely cleared up, this has blown up and SO never speaks to T any more.

Recently my SO's friend had a birthday which we were both invited to- and also T. We were told she wouldn't arrive before a certain time, so we planned to leave before then to ensure his friends birthday didn't become awkward. Horror of horrors when she showed up really early and tension was incredibly high. Somehow T ended up driving us back to the train station and it was awful. She was trying to talk to my SO and pretended I didn't even exist. 

 T recently asked for him to go over to her house for a 'few days' for him to collect his stuff from her house. I'm incredibly uncomfortable with this since obviously that invitation will not extend to me- it's clear she doesn't like me one bit, for whatever reason- and I'm scared that as soon as T's got him on his own with her, she'll attempt to convince him that I'm somehow bad for him and that it's me that's fucked up their relationship. 


Obviously I am in no place to tell him he can't go. I mean, she's his mother!! Though he is happier not having contact with her, she keeps trying more recently, and it makes us both uncomfortable, and he finds it difficult to just not respond.

**The Sort-Of-Questions bit**

The idea of eventually marrying this man, and being tied to T as my MIL and having to deal with these awkward and tense issues for the very extended future, is just horrendous. 

* How do I deal with the relationship tension between them, if they can't sort it out because my SO doesn't want to? Would it be intrusive of me to step into what looks like isn't anything of my concern, but is somehow my fault?
* Should I voice my concerns about him maybe going to stay at his mothers for a few days? She lives reasonably locally to us- it wouldn't take more than a couple of hours. There's also no way of him retrieving the sheer volume of stuff without a car, as neither of us drive- that would mean she'd have to come back to our flat and I don't know if I'm comfortable with that either.
* Will I have to endure awkward family/friendship get-togethers for a lifetime?! 
*Do I sound like I'm just a bit bitter, or what? From an outside perspective, what does this look like? I've become a bit confused by it all really.
* Is there a chance that my SO could become narcissistic in the same way, given time? This is a big worry for me.

**TLDR;** I'm sorry for the long and complicated post. Terrible potential MIL, narcissistic and emotionally abusive towards her son, my SO. I don't want her to be a part of my life, but committing myself to my SO means she inevitably will be. What gives?

24667,Non-Romantic,39em9d,"My friend, we'll call her Rebecca. She and I have been very close for about two years now, and met at a time when we were both looking for a new group of people to hang out with, so we became fast friends.

In the past six months, two major events happened. First, I broke up with my boyfriend of 3 years. Second, I started spending a lot more time with a new friend, Marie, than I did with Rebecca. She did admit to me at one point that she was afraid that Marie would replace her, but I assured her that I have a big heart with room for many friends. 

A few weeks ago, Rebecca, Marie, and I went on a road trip with a few other friends. There were a lot of things that happened on the trip that I won't go into for the sake of length, but spending that much time together created a lot of tension, i think. Rebecca was, I felt, very rude to me the entire trip, bossed me around and refused to compromise at every turn. I could tell there was a lot of resentment toward me coming from her.

At the end of the trip, Marie confronted me saying that Rebecca had told her that I was only friends with her because I like the way she looks and wanted to social climb, and wanted to know if it was true. Turns out, Rebecca had gone on a long tirade to Marie about how I am a calculating social climber who always has selfish ulterior motives. Now, I can see how she might come to that conclusion because I had rapidly started to expand my social circles after breaking up with my boyfriend, but this was out of pure loneliness and a need to constantly surround myself with people. And I definitely did not choose my new friends based on their looks. To top it all off, Rebecca broke up with her boyfriend a couple months after I did, and I made a point to invite her to all the events with my new friends so that she could have a support system as well, and she thanked me on multiple occasions for doing that. So, these comments seem hypocritical to me.

I am really hurt by her comments, especially her attempt to put a divide between me and Marie by telling her I was only friends with her for her looks. Here's the catch: We have to be roommates for the next 6 months. She is acting like nothing happened, and I don't want to sell out Marie and tell Rebecca what she said, but I am not going to be happy living with and pretending to be friends with someone who said these things behind my back and tried to ruin another relationship of mine. 

How should I address this situation? I am a very rational person, and she is very emotionally volatile, so I am afraid of hurting her feelings at all because in the past when I have done something she doesn't like she has gone so far as to threaten to bust the windows in my car. Even if I discontinue the friendship after awhile, we still have to live together for the time being.

I'll make things short. I met this guy a couple years ago. Went out with him three times. Did not get a good vibe from him. I was naive and I was in my experimental phase, so I ended up sleeping with him. Refused to see him again after that.

He texted me endlessly, asking me to go out with him. When I wouldn't, he'd send insane texts like I hope your life is filled with bloody abortions and followed them with I'm sorry I didn't mean that, you're so beautiful. I threatened to take action, he finally left me alone.

So recently he got exposed as a pick-up artist/predator that's opened his own pick-up business where he trains other guys to do the same. I was so appalled. I literally felt like puking when my friend told me. The guys denies that he's being a predator.

I sent the site that published the article my history with the guy (without any incriminating details) and screenshots of his texts to me. They haven't published my message or anything. I think there's still time to take it back.

Once the semester began, my ability to do research went down to 0 as the lab I had to use was only open between 8am and 4pm, times when I was busy in class and didn't have an open block to go in and get my work done.

So I plan to be moving cross country with my boyfriend, Chris. We've been together for almost 5 years and we both have wanted this move for a long time.

We both have college degrees, but have student loans to pay and don't make too much money at our jobs. Therefore, we figured we'd get a roomate when we move to save money on rent. 

Cue my best friend, Anna. She LOVES the idea of being roomates and moving pretty far away from everyone we know, because she feels stuck here. I like the thought of her moving in with us, but I have a couple of doubts because of her current way through life:

She lives at home with her alcoholic mother and sexually abusive father. She doesn't have a car and lives in the middle of nowhere, so she has to depend on her parents for rides to work and because they're unreliable, she hasn't been able to hold down a steady job for more than a month at most. 

She also has very bad relationships with men. She's dated a heroin user who threatened to infect her with an HIV needle if she tried to leave, and then killed himself soon after she did. She's dated a 16 year old and lived with him and his mother for a month (Technically rape I think...) and generally is drawn towards the unpredictable, unreliable and completely untrustworthy types.

She is also the queen of one night stands and likes to go to clubs. She was into Molly for a while, but not anymore. 

I love this girl; she is my best friend and I want her to succeed in life. But I don't want her to bring strange men to our new home, who might take our stuff at best and hurt us at most. Her lifestyle makes me nervous.

She says she'll have more work opportunities once we move, because we are planning to live in a city so she can walk/take the bus/train to work and won't have to rely on anyone for rides. 

I want this to work out for all of us, but I don't know if it can. Should there be rules (Can't have random men over unless Chris and I approve, if she can't pay rent she has 2 months to do so or she can move out?) When I say it like that it seems very harsh, especially the guy thing.

But we are moving to a place we don't know anyone, so I don't want to be made vulnerable and helpless.

24683,Non-Romantic,2pug6v,"Some background info: I didn't get my driver's license until I was 18, something which really annoyed my brother as he believed that in order to be an adult, you have to be able to drive. I'm a decent driver, but because I go to school out of state, I only ever really drive when I am home for summer and winter break. Meaning that although I've had my license for 2 years, I've only ever really driven for about six months. Generally, when I come home for break, I like to wait until I've driven a couple of times before driving on the highway, so I can re-acclimate myself to the road and feel more comfortable behind the wheel. 

Well, today I came home for winter break and texted my brother about going to see the Hobbit, something which we had been planning to do since Thanksgiving. He texted me back about going to see a 9:35pm showing at a theater that in order to get to you have to take a highway which I have never driven on before, and which is one of the more complex roads in our city. Generally, if we go to this theater he comes and picks me up, but when I asked him his response was that I am a licensed driver and that he would meet me there. Fair enough, but I just got back yesterday and was up really late last night finishing a paper. Also, I've never driven on this particular highway and didn't feel comfortable attempting it by myself for the first time at night when I was jet lagged and tired. So, I asked him if we could go to another theater which was showing the movie at the same time which I felt more comfortable driving to myself.

Well, this set off a giant back and forth between my brother and myself in which he was yelling at me to be an adult and just drive there, and I was trying to explain that I didn't feel comfortable doing so. I then said that if he didn't want to change the venue, then I just couldn't go and he could see it with his friend and girlfriend and I would see it some other time. But he just kept on pushing back saying that I was an adult, and I wasn't going to grow without challenging myself. 

This is maybe the first fight we've ever had, and I honestly don't understand why he is making such a big deal over changing the location. It's not like this was set in stone, and I don't get why it would be such a hassle to go to a place where I could drive myself without being worried about getting into a car accident because I didn't know the road. He keeps on telling me to be an adult, but I feel like the adult thing to do is to try and reach a compromise, which I was trying to do by either changing the location, or offering to stay home while he saw it with someone else. My brother and I have seen all of the Hobbit movies together, and the driving thing has never been an issue before. I want to see it with him, but I also don't want to let him bully me into doing something which I feel unsafe doing (which I told him in the last text which he has yet to respond to). 

Am I in the wrong here?

EDIT: I apologized to my brother for asking to move the location. I realize that it is unfair of me to ask other people to change their plans just because I feel like I am unable to do something. I still don't feel comfortable driving there myself, but I will try to work at it. I do think that the way he approached it was a bit too harsh, but I realize that he is a military man and he was just trying to help me in his own way.

EDIT 2: I seriously have the best big brother in the world. I didn't mention this out of embarrassment, but part of the reason I've been freaking out about driving is that I've been having a panic attack over a final paper that is worth half my grade. My brother picked up on that, and even though I said I wouldn't be good company tonight because of how I'm freaking out, he's having one of his friends come and pick me up because he wants me to have a good time. I have the best brother ever and I don't deserve him.

24711,Non-Romantic,37c19w,"I have been browsing reddit for years, but this is the first time I've ever had any serious thing to post. I work at a school in a foreign country, everything was great until one day I seemed to have awakened a monster in a fellow teacher. 

I am now 80 days into a nightmare where this guy G has made it his goal to destroy my life. It started when I was flirting with a female colleague in the office (stupid, I know, but don't worry, I paid the price and then some). This guy was there and he got super jealous and agitated, which I couldn't understand because he has a girlfriend in a different part of the world. Anyway, he spent the next two weeks trying to ruin my chances with any girl in the office by taking flirting to an entire different level. Instead of doing work (which is what we're there for) this guy had his guitar, was chatting up every girl nonstop, with all types of bullshit, it was crazy to see in an office. 

I was getting pretty frustrated that this guy would be such a dick to purposely try to ruin my chances with someone, but I had no idea what was coming. After letting my frustration build over the course of the two weeks, I finally contacted him and asked if we could talk. BIG MISTAKE. 

I explained that I thought there was a weird dynamic going on in the office, and I thought that he was consciously or unconsciously had a problem with me flirting with the women. It was just my perspective, but I asked if he was interested in the girls, or if there was something going on I didn't know about. He said that he had a girlfriend and he wasn't interested in those girls and it was just his personality to be outgoing.  

Without telling me, he recorded that conversation, which I'll get to later.

A few weeks later when nothing had changed and I couldn't take being around the guy anymore, I informed my boss that I would like to switch offices. This guy had previously threatened me, and I told my boss that I thought he was acting aggressively towards me at work and combined I would like to move. The next day he was looking all sad at his desk, had his hood on and his head down. Stupid me, I thought that informing the boss had worked, so when she came to ask if I wanted to switch offices, I said that I thought it would be okay to stay. My colleague then changed his mood instantly and went outside to chat with the boss. He came back in and immediately started going up to each girl, making a lot of body contact, and making plans to work on 'stuff' together. At that point I was so disgusted that I asked him to stop talking.

He flipped his shit. He started screaming in my face, saying I wasn't a man, telling me to look at him. I just ignored him and kept doing my work, figuring that that was it for him, nobody could get away with that. He stormed out of the office and went home. (The school provides on campus housing) We got called to my boss' office a little while later, and I outrageously got blamed for initiating the incident. I was told to switch offices, which I didn't mind, but I couldn't believe how blind they were being.

After work, this guy decides to have a party at his house and invites my ex-girlfriend over (for the first time), and while they're walking I hear him trashing me to her. Being furious at this point, I ask him how his girlfriend is, and he comes over and grabs the back of my neck and tells me that I'm getting myself into a lot of trouble. Mind you, we're on school grounds, and fighting is not even entering into my mind. I ignore him and go on my own way when he yells that he had recorded the conversation that we had had previously and played it to the bosses. 

I decide to forget about the situation and move on, since I'm in a new office. UNFORTUNATELY, this guy's apartment is right under mine and he starts this campaign of making tons of noise all the time. I'd lived over him for a year, and I never had heard anything before, now it sounded like he was having sex three times a day, moving furniture constantly, and singing at the top of his lungs. It didn't take me long to realize that I needed to move out. I told my boss through email that I wanted to move out, she asked why, I said I wanted to have a peaceful life, she said why, so I said that I felt trapped living above a guy that I felt was dangerous. She didn't respond, but the noise below me stopped .The covert harassment didn't though. I took it into my own hands and got an apartment in the city away from the school, where I am now (the school apartment was free, so I'm out $1500 for three months, but it seemed worth it).

This guy is still after me though. He's building this little clan of people that he basically controls, mostly women, and he pays attention to my life. He's extremely charming, charismatic, and can be very attractive to women. If he thinks I have a friendship with someone, he will try to win that person over, and trash talk me. There's more, but I'll stop because I think I've gotten my point across. I learned early that he could easily turn situations against me, and that with a little effort he could convert most people to his way of thinking, so I'm pretty alone on this thing, except for my Dad that I talk to, and another colleague that agreed with me, but who quit a few weeks ago.

Now, the only reason I'm staying is because teaching is my career, and I'm really trying to build a good life for myself. I got a better job starting in August at another school in this city, and everything is going well for me outside of this situation. I don't want to quit because: 

a) not having a job for three months would hurt me economically, plus the school is providing me with a plane ticket home over summer break 
b) I don't want to quit a job when I'm trying to build a good future for myself in this career. 

The problem is that I'm scared of how this thing turns out. He's supposed to leave the country in July and go live with his girlfriend, but I have this feeling that he's going to stay. I'm worried about being in situations with him that are work related for the emotional trauma, and the constant aggression directed at me, that he hides from everyone else. I'm concerned about how far he's willing to go, and what he would count as a 'victory.' Reddit I need help, just a voice of reason at this point I think.


   
**tl;dr**: Colleague has targeted me for his own amusement, and has everyone else fooled. Want to leave but money and future career goals are preventing me. Help!

**edit** I know I fucked up by flirting with girls in the office. But that's over and this isn't. He is just looking for ways to fuck with me now, and that's what I really need advice about. Many people say not to engage, which is what I've been doing. I moved offices, I moved apartments, I don't talk about him to anyone, but he's not finished. He goes after my friendly and professional relationships by saying bad things about me and trying to win people over. The thing that is clear to me about his behavior is that's it's directed at me. The people that are important to me, become important to him.

**edit 2** Almost all of this happened in March and early April. Since then I have done nothing to escalate, and been a saint to everyone in hopes of leaving the situation behind me. I have not done anything in about 50 days. ",Me [33 M] with my sociopathic colleague [28 M].

24726,Non-Romantic,3a1p1u,"Background : My friend T and I have been friends since highschool during our friendship we've had ups and downs but have remained friends over the years. We both had our daughters young and we really bonded when they were born. My friend has dated alot of men over the years we've known each other and I have always been supportive of those relationships. T is the kind of person who goes after who/what she wants, shes independent confident beautiful etc, she has a great personality too But one thing about her that i've always hated is her love of drama. Ever since i've known her shes always waist deep in drama. She has jumped from one relationship to another for aslong as i've known her. She's always seeking something more after the spark and the chase gets old she starts looking for someone new. Which is fine, i still supported her no matter what.

 Fast forward to almost 4 years ago, she met her husband J while she was away and dating someone else. They fell in love and he proposed only six weeks after knowing her. She came home, broke up with her bf  and told me about J and their plans of getting married. I was shocked but supported her I wanted her to be happy. I met J, when he came to visit and he was a great guy, funny, smart , mellow , quiet and extremely kind..in some ways the complete opposite of her but they were happy, they were so in love and I thought for sure she had met her soul mate. The wedding came and went and i stood by them as they said their vows, it was one of the best days of my life. We laughed, drank, celebrated and had a wonderful time.

Since the wedding they had been trying to have a baby, because J wanted nothing more then to be a father, he was a great step dad, coached his step daughters soccer team etc he loved her instantly from day one. we saw each other every so often to catch up and things seemed great except they hadn't conceived yet.

Fast forward to this year, I got together with T while J was away on a business trip, he had been gone a month and wasn't due back for another month. T started to confide in me about their marriage and how it wasn't going so well, she said J was boring in bed, he wouldn't communicate with her, they were not getting pregnant as fast as she wanted etc, while he  had been away she went out drinking and partying and said she felt young again. So during this talk shes texting like a mad woman, and she says my friend is coming over to chill for a bit, i say okay whatever. A guy shows up that she had met at work, 10 years older then us and married to one of her good friends L.

 I see chemistry between them, and the drama unfolding before my eyes, like i had seen so many times before. While he was over they got into an argument about him saying his wife couldn't know he was here hanging with us etc, so she told him to leave. After that she got rip roaring drunk and i fell asleep on the couch. I woke up and she was gone, i found her outside passed out in the snow. it was 3 am and a car pulled up and L's husband came up and helped me get her into the house, i assumed he was there because they had been texting and he came to check on her because he knew she was upset. i was fine with this, im glad he was there to help me so anyway i get her into bed, and he comes in and gets in bed with us, T is awake and fine , just cold and sad, and drunk off her ass. he starts rubbing her legs/arms/back and cuddles into her. I freaked the fuck out and asked him to leave the room. I asked T what was going on? and she said he was a great guy and her best friend and not to worry he was just helping her through a rough time.

 I slept in the guest room , and the next day i cried my eyes out, because I loved J, He was an amazing guy and my boyfriend and  I had spent a lot of time with him, we really loved him and were afraid T was having an affair, and we didn't want J getting hurt. T said nothing was going on, he was just a concerned friend and his wife knew everything that had happened and J also knew and was fine with it. I believed her and tried to put it out of my mind.

A month goes by and J returns home, 2 days later he committed suicide. T's dad called me with the news and i ran over and held her while we cried for hours, i didn't understand what could have happened, it felt unreal because the J that i knew would never kill himself, he would never leave a child he loved and his wife who he adored despite everything. But it was real, it did happen and everybody was completely broken. Its been two months since his funeral and i have been over to see T a lot to help her/support her. That's when i met L (the wife of the guy who was with T that drunken night) we both have taken turns helping T cope with guilt/ pain/sadness over losing J . I started to notice she was hiding her phone a lot around L, and was asking her a lot about how her relationship with her husband was going, coincidentally they had just separated. 

I watched and Listened to T comfort L, tell her not to give up on her marriage and to fight for her man etc. that night we went to bed and she must have thought i had fallen asleep i heard her phone ring and it was L's husband wanted to face time, i laid there and listened..and heard some fucked up shit.  they missed each other, he wanted to fuck her and couldn't wait, he loved her, didn't deserve her etc etc. In the morning i was sick to my stomach because i feel so bad for L, her husband has probably been cheating on her for quite some time with T. I love T, but i am disgusted at her behavior, she is like a different person, one minute shes one person the next shes another. I understand she is going through some heavy shit, and i want to be there for her but i don't know if i can stand by and know what i know and not say a thing to L. I want T to be happy, Losing J was horrible for her, she told me later on that when J got home she had told him they were done and she wanted a divorce. the next morning he killed himself and she carries alot of guilt about it.

 I have remained silent about everything, i've been a good friend , loyal i haven't said a word to anyone about anything. I miss J, sometimes i sit and cry and wonder if i had said something about the things i saw while he was gone maybe it would have made a difference, maybe he would have just left her and moved on. I'm torn, i love T she is who she is, and i accept her. I try not to judge, i have no idea what she is going through, but i feel so much guilt. The other night she text my phone asking if my boyfriend could go over and do her a favor, I didn't write back until the next day ( i got the message at midnight) Deep down i worried she was trying to get him to go over there for a reason, she's always really liked my boyfriend they get along well and she flirts with him all the time and it never bothered me until now. Now i don't know if i can trust her at all after watching whats happened. 

so reddit...what do i do? Should i just distance myself from her and remain her friend? should i call her out?? should i stop being friends with her to avoid drama? i Don't know what to do.

24741,Non-Romantic,20cf8n,"Hi all,


Long time lurker and I'm hoping to get some outside third party advice as emotions are clouding my judgement. Recently, my sister and I got in an argument, which has led to me not talking to her for 4 months now. I would like to (honestly!) know if I am overreacting or being unreasonable about how to deal with her/my parents.


Back story - I live on the other side of my country (think ~7 hour flight home) in a remote community. It is expensive to go home so I only get to do it once a year. I work full time to support myself, live modestly (with roommates) as I am trying to pay down my student debt and hopefully can put down a down payment on a house in two years.


My sister, on the other hand, dropped out of university with a semester to go before she finished, two years ago to pursue a career in modeling. Because of this, she has lost significant weight (think 5'11, 115 lbs :( ) and is surrounded by people that she is beautiful the skinnier she gets (a photographer called her ethiopian chic, wtf...racist and so wrong!). She refuses to take any other jobs because it interferes with her modeling career. Often, her photoshoots give her little to no money, or make her pay. She is earning next to nothing. Because of this, my parents have been bailing her out and are suffering financially as they just make enough to get by pay check to pay check. In the past, she asked me for money (and promised to pay back), and finally I stopped giving money to her, which led to her basically stop talking to me. My parents, however, continue, even if it means them being late on a bill.


The most recent event that led up to this argument was my father calling me saying he was late on a bill ($800). My grandma had just died and I suppose feeling bad I was so far away, I agreed to LEND him the money (first time I ever had). He assured me he could pay it back by a certain date. Date came and went. Nothing. I called, he doesn't pick up. I then find out he was late on the bill because of paying rent for my sister and now could not pay me back. I never saw that $800 again (I am on a very tight budget so this hurt me financially).


Because of this (and years of them propping up Elsa's destructive behaviour), I decided to go low contact with my dad/mom and sister. Finally after my parents wondered why I wasn't talking to them, I explained I was tired of them enabling Elsa and how I would never lend them money again as they broke my trust (I will only ever give money as a gift but didn't tell them that - lesson learnt). My father felt bad but we somewhat talked it out but I still remained uneasy with my mother and wanted to talk it out in person once I went home ~xmas time.


When I went home, I received large guilt trips by my parents asking why I wasn't visiting elsa. I stated because she acts entitled, spoiled, says mean things about people who struggle with weight, only engages with me when she wants money, amongst many other reasons. After two weeks of them both stating how much they want us to get along, I said I would invite her along for an evening girls nights with my friends (figured I would try once more...maybe she had changed, she was now working for an office as an admin). So I travel into the city where she lives, as well as my best friend (I was staying with my best friend). She calls asking what plans are and I state me and best friend are doing a low key evening - think a drink and live music in a pub. She replies she isn't interested in that and has organized a whole event where we will be going clubbing to gorgeous places with free cover. I state, while thanks for planning a neat evening, that my best bud is worried about the cost of these amazing places (drinks, etc). 


My best friend, Kelly, is on such tight budget and is an introvert, so I couldn't see this working. I suggest we could meet for drinks at the pub and then Elsa could go clubbing with her friends, and then she could come back to Kelly's after? It was my only evening with Kelly in her city and we've been best buds for 10+ years, I wasn't going to bail on her evening that we had planned for months.


Elsa lost it, started screaming on the phone, stating that I was a bitch, and how dare I change her plans she worked so hard to plan for me. I kept my cool and asked her not to yell and I'm sure all our plans could somehow work. Nope, cue more screaming, name calling, etc. I stated you can stop screaming at me or call me back. She then screams she just won't get together with me as I ruined her evening and I state, ok have a nice evening. Stunned silence by her, then slamming her phone down. Later that evening, after years of this kind of behaviour, I sent her an email stating (short version):


 I will no longer tolerate:

- temper tantrums
- hanging up of phone calls
- yelling
- swearing
- manipulation through threatening to not join my outings, etc
- refusing to talk
- refusing to listen when angry
- lack of apologies

I am willing to listen to and talk when you decide to respect those boundaries and are calm. We are adults, I'd like to fight like adults. If you are open to this, know that any time the said list above is disrespected, I will either leave the room or ask you to call back when you are calm. ...I love you but will tolerate no more of this, what I feel is abusive behavior towards the people who care about you most. The ball is in your court.


I heard back from her (text) stating she had something so bad happen to her that my parents and I would be ashamed of her. She prefers to remain the bad guy as it is easier. She prefers to be on her own. I have no idea what to make of this text, except she definitely didn't apologize for behaviours, in fact, justified them due to a terrible past experience.


My parents found out about our lack of evening, and my father is pressuring me to write her a letter declaring all the lovely times that we had together and how I wish it was like that again. He stated, if I don't reach out, things like this might never change. I just replied I'd think about it.


I've asked for my parents to not talk about Elsa with me as I will change the subject, but they continue to do so (and I change the subject). I now don't talk to my mother as she continues to support Elsa's modeling career and gives her money. I'm tired of phone calls around Elsa so I just don't call my mom. I'm confused to how I feel about my father as he just appears to want everyone to get along but knows Elsa won't change.


I am unsure what (if anything), to do. I'm just tired of this all. I don't even know what I'm asking...

When I met my husband (20) he was with his girlfriend (20) of 4 years, Bailey. They had a 2 year old daughter together, Diane.  My husband (Brandon) is the youngest of 8, most of which still live at home with (or next door to) their parents. I will only mention the relevant siblings.

May - 28

Sarah - 29

Garrett - 36

Mike - 27

My husband's family is very...close. Two of his brothers and two of his sisters still lived at home or rented a house close next door. The sisters both had three kids of their own. It was expected that my husband would stay living close by with his children as well (hence why they were so happy he had a child with the woman next door) and they were very unhappy when we started talking about moving. 

*edit to add:* 

*Also, his family was very unappreciative of Brandon. He was the second of all 8 kids to go to college. He paid for it himself, yet when he asked for gas money to get to school his parents told him it HAD to be paid back. One of his brothers, Mike, gave him a truck to get back and forth to school. But then MIL tells him that no, he actually owes Mike $2000 for the truck. WHAT?? Garrett GAVE Mike that truck a few years prior and now Brandon is supposed to PAY Mike for it?? He refused to pay. Anytime we visited we were expected to do physical labor. Actually, after only dating a few weeks they made me paint their living room ceiling...*

My husband was already in school an hour away and was driving back and forth. He hated the drive and wanted to move up there as soon as he was done because he knew he wanted to work in the city. We told his mother we were considering moving to a town 12 hours away and she got very upset. She asked What does (city 12 hours away) have that (town 1/2 hour away) doesn't have?? No. That's stupid. You're staying here. When we made it clear we did not want to stay in this town she started saying things about how our relationship won't last (we were engaged at this point) and that my husband would leave me in 3 years MAX. She said that right in front of me. When she saw the look on my face she just says Sorry, I don't mean to offend you, I just know how he is....

That's when everything started going to hell.
 When Bailey found out we were planning on moving she got PISSED. She was now stuck in this town and always wanted to move away with Brandon when his schooling was over. She started keeping Diane away from Brandon more and more out of spite and eventually she up and moved without giving my husband any notice. He had no idea where she moved to or how to contact her.

For some reason, EVERYTHING is always my fault when it comes to my inlaws. It's now MY fault that their baby boy is moving away. It's now MY fault that they don't get to see their granddaughter. They treated me horribly and called me a stuck up bitch to my face, just because of how I acted. (I don't like eating at new people's houses, I was scared to ride on the 4wheelers, and I'm very reserved around people I just meet and they are very open outgoing people). My husband kept warning them to stop treating me so badly or else they would lose him. They kept treating me like crap. He dropped contact with them.

In this time there is little contact with his family. When it is, it's his mom telling us not to come to her funeral. She has multiple health problems and in the past when my husband cut contact with her she actually called an ambulance for heart pains. Nothing was wrong with her, she was trying to guilt trip my husband. She does similar things on occasion. That, or it's his sisters bitching at him for not fighting for his daughter and how I'm such a bitch for not MAKING him find her.

So a few months go by, we are living in a new city about an hour away. My husband still has no idea where his daughter is (no money for lawyer at the time) and still no contact with family except for random drama filled phone calls (I heard you came down to ((hometown)) last weekend WHY DIDNT YOU COME SEE US???). Eventually I get a message online from his sister May. She says something along the lines of I miss my brother. I know the only way to get him back is to apologize to you, so if this is what I have to do then I'll do it. Sorry. Can you have him call me? I was a bit pissed because that was far from a real apology, but my husband wants to give his family another chance. I want to be a supportive wife, so I agree. We start visiting occasionally and things are...okay. Until....

Christmas comes around. Now, when I first met my husband I was underweight. I have a very small frame and I was very active at the time so I had a hard time gaining weight. After some eating/weight issues by this point I had gained weight. Not terribly much, but I was verging on the heavy side of normal which was a HUGE change on my small frame from being underweight. For Christmas May and Garrett got us both t-shirts. My husbad's, size Medium. Mine? Size 2XL. I was SO embarrassed. I cried for days. Did they REALLY think I was that fucking huge?? 

Also along this time we found out that May and Sarah were still in contact with Bailey and never told my husband. When we asked if they were still friends with her they said NO that they only put up with her in order to see their niece. Fair enough, but Brandon should have known so that he could be seeing her as well.

The next weekend they call Brandon and say that Bailey had dropped Diane off that night, but now wont respond to them and they want to know if Brandon wants her for the night. He says yes. We go get her and the next morning Bailey is blowing up Brandon's phone and has called the cops on him for kidnapping his daughter. Luckily, this weekend was a designated weekend on their paperwork anyways so he was in no trouble. But now Bailey decides to keep Diane from his family as well. MY fault again. Some how. 

After some more drama and them treating both of us like shit, but still blaming me for taking away their family my husband has cut them off again. The only contact he has is with Mike who never joined in on any drama, but even that is scarce.

In this time my husband and I have had 2 kids. Lori (3) and Jane (3 months) NOT ONCE has his family called and asked how they were doing, or tried to make amends with me, or anything. When my husband text a picture of Jane when she was first born his mother replied Cool. Wtf. And then a few days later my husband gets a text from his mother of a newborn baby. My husband's half brother who lives in IRELAND (we are in the US), whom NOBODY (even his dad) knew even existed until a few years ago, just had a baby and she was texting him her picture and talking about how pretty she was...

I am obviously hurt by this. If they can put up with his ex, a crazy psycho druggie (a story for another time) to see their niece/granddaughter, why cant they put up with me?? Why can't they try and accept that my husband and I love each other and that I am now apart of their family? What is SO wrong with me that they can't accept me as apart of their lives?? We have been together a total of 6 years now, married for 4 1/2.

Lately my husband's family has started trying to reach out again, but I'm not sure if it is worth the effort. The same things always happens. He now sees his daughter like he should, but has still cut off contact with his family until they recently started texting/calling. I can tell he sort of wants to reconnect, but when we talk about it we agree that they are all dicks. 

I'm just not sure what to do here. All I've ever wanted was to be a supportive wife. Anytime he says he wants to go visit, I say ok but our daughter has to stay at my mother's while we do. (we haven't visited at all since i was about 2 months pregnant with our youngest) But I'm not sure I can go through all of the drama again. I can tell his family hasn't changed one bit, but he grew up with these people. They were close. He knows they are horrible people, but he loves them.

I'm not even sure if I'm asking a specific question, but any advice or opinions are welcome...

24761,Non-Romantic,1ty2ar,"I guess a bit of a break down is necessary in order to better explain:

I mentioned that he's my step-dad so that the advice given is more specific to my situation. However, in my mind, he is my dad and more a dad than my biological father has ever been. My mom married him when I was 2 and they've been together every since (even after what happened). He's raised me and my little brother. Now on to what actually happened:

I was 11 and in the 6th grade. I had this habit of waking up early and going to my parent's room until I had to get ready for school to just sleep. During this time period, my mom would get up before me and my dad to shower and eat breakfast because she had a longer commute to work than we did. That would leave me and my dad alone in bed for about a half-hour to an hour.

Sometimes during these mornings, my dad would get too touchy. I'd say about 5 times he'd randomly just touch my body (in general) or hug me frequently and very tightly. I remember feeling uncomfortable, but because nothing drastic had happened, I felt like there was no reason to say anything. So, I'd go back to the room almost every morning. That is, until one very specific Monday morning my dad turned around, hugged me from behind, and then proceeded to groping my body and putting his hand inside of my underwear, and molesting me. I sort of froze out of fear, realized what was happening and that I couldn't mistake it for something else, took his hand out, stayed there for a few seconds, heard his apology and ran out of the room crying to my mom. I told her immediately what happened and my dad came running to the bathroom to apologize some more and hug me. 

It was all kind of a blur. I didn't catch any looks between them and was overall oblivious to the way my mom reacted to him. When she and I were alone again, she comforted me until I settled down and asked me what happened and I told her. She then asked me 2 questions: Did he put any fingers inside of you? and Do you want him to stay here? The first one was a no, but I had to think about the second one for a few minutes. All I remember thinking was my mom would lose her husband and my brother would lose his father because of me. So I said that he could stay on the account that it would never happen again because even the best people make mistakes and I'd give him one chance.

That day I didn't go to school. My mom couldn't skip work, but my dad stayed home. He took me out to eat and go shopping. I tried my best to make it comfortable and it was an overall okay day. I ended up dismissing it as something that just happened and thought that if I let it traumatize me, I was being weak because children go through much worse things and they get along fine.

I guess the thing about traumas is that you can't really control them.

Fast-forward to today. I've been an overall healthy young woman sexually. My relationship with both of my parents is very good ever since I went to college and we have almost no problems talking about anything. That is, anything except this. My dad also has this weird pattern of behavior where he can be stern, chill dad one moment and then turn into this strange, touchy and very admiring dad. Admiring in the sense that he'll say I look really good or that I'm great and that he loves me a lot. 

My current boyfriend [23M] who's absolutely wonderful, spent a week with me and my family for Christmas. I don't live with my parents anymore because of school, like I said, so it was sort of like a mini-vacation for the two of us. We had a very nice time for the most part, but on the 6th day of our stay, we started to notice that things weren't going so well in my home. My dad gets very depressed during Christmas and drinks a lot of alcohol. He's very sick these days and takes a lot of medication for anxiety, depression, diabetes and heart problems, so basically he was mixing alcohol with all of his medication. This makes him feel even worse all around. My mom isn't very forgiving because she's been dealing with it for a long time and my brother doesn't do much except play on his DS (that Pokemon game is apparently very good). I decided to try and comfort him which lead to a strange moment of quality-time, where he got overly touchy (just lots of hugs and physical contact in general) and admiring. That night, I went out with my boyfriend and wore a dress, to which my dad said I looked sexy. He doesn't always use that word. 

Every time something like this happens since the incident ten years ago, it makes me feel weird but I've always dismissed it. However, that night my bf started talking to me about how he feels a bit uncomfortable with how my dad treats me as well. He knows about what happened all those years ago, so I get why he would. I usually defend my dad, surprisingly... not because of what he did but I defend my decision of letting him stay home and note that he's changed and it never happened again. However, I just had to listen to my bf at that moment because he isn't the kind of person to make something big out of something that isn't important. And that's when it happened. 

I blurted out that I actually hate how my dad treats me, I don't like it when he's too touchy or when he calls me sexy and that I'd prefer to just have a casual relationship with him where we talk and where he's my dad, not some touchy, sick man. I also said that I've prepared myself mentally for him to die soon, because he's sick. If he does, my mom who is a lot younger than him (17 years younger to be exact), can go and do what she likes and my brother can get to college and get his life on track.

Funny thing how life can work because, that night, my dad went to the emergency room because he couldn't breathe and had a panic attack. He was back by morning and was fine but they upped his medication.

I left the next day to my apartment for a week because it was already getting kind of intense at home and I wanted to spend New Year's over here. That was yesterday. Last night, me and my bf tried having sex because a week at my parent's house didn't give us a lot of privacy. We started getting into it until I flipped. I couldn't stop thinking of my dad. I even imagined him saying and doing the things by bf was doing. 

I bawled my eyes out. I felt like shit for wanting him to die and for all the things I said. I eventually relaxed and made an effort to let my bf know that it wasn't anything he did specifically, I just couldn't get my dad out of my head from the night before and didn't talk to him about it because I thought I'd be fine. We tried having sex again, this time me leading completely, and it was very loving, awesome sex.

I know that the usual advice given here is to talk it out with the people involved. I get that that would be the ideal thing to do, but how can I bring this up to my dad 10 years later after never speaking about it? What if it triggers an even deeper depression for him? Wouldn't it be weird and potentially destructive for my home, which I don't actively take part in because I don't live there? I care about my dad and my family and I want my dad to change how he acts with me, but I don't know what course of action to take. I don't know what to do, Reddit. I need your advice.

**TL;DR**: My step-dad molested me 10 years ago and we never spoke about it (he's still part of the family). During Christmas week, I realized that it still affects me, to the point where it was difficult to have sex with my bf, something which has never happened. Should I speak to my parents about it even though it's been such a long time since the act?","Ten years ago, my step-dad [64M] molested me [21F]. I thought I was over it, but am not.

From the beginning, this girl told me that she was single and that there was no guy in the picture. But over the course of a couple of months, there were numerous sightings by guys I know from the gym of this girl out in public. And all those sightings had one thing in common, she was out with the same guy (same description every time). Even worse, the description I got of the guy was the same description that she herself gave me of her *ex-boyfriend*.

With all of this, she has tried to cheat with me which is the only reason I haven't called her out on what I'm thinking. I've had girls lie to me about not having boyfriends but they would all immediately proceed to try and cheat with me right away which I knew was a red flag that they were cheaters. This girl is not doing that.

As a last resort to figure things out, I ran the situation by a friend of mine and he immediately said that I was her fantasy boy. I asked him what he meant and he said that I'm the type of guy who attracts attention from other girls and that this girl thinks it's innocent and not a big deal to use me to get other girls jealous because she craves the attention she gets from it in a competitive nature.

I would hate for this to be true but the only other explanation I can come up with is that she withheld the fact that she had a boyfriend because she was afraid that I wouldn't want to be her friend anymore if I knew she was taken but that's clearly not the case. But it would still be fucked up because she has told me numerous times that she doesn't have a boyfriend which would mean she's intentionally leading me on.

So am I being used as attention bait or is there some other explanation for all of this? What should I do?

Sam is in 6th grade. He is very smart, has always been interested in science and technology. He used to read tons of books about space, animals, etc and he knows a lot about those subjects. About four years ago, our sister started dating and eventually married a guy [now 23M] who has always been into video games (Call of Duty, Halo, etc) and he and Sam started bonding by playing. Sam had gotten various systems as gifts over the years (GameCube, DS, Wii) but had never played an Xbox. Playing width my BIL on his Xbox 360 has gotten him really interested. *Really* interested, to the point where he never plays outside anymore. Comes home from school, does homework, plays video games. That's it. Somewhere in the last year or so he acquired an Xbox 360 (I'm not sure where from). 


 A few months ago, he called and told me he was joining an advanced STEM program at his middle school, and he was really excited about it. Last week, I talked to him and he said he decided to join the band instead of the STEM program (he could only choose one). We talked for a few minutes and everything sounded fine. Afterward, I talked to my sister and BIL and they tell me his grades (which have always been PERFECT) have dropped extremely low. He got an F in science on his last report card--he was supposed to take a quiz on class, bring it home, get it signed by a parent, and bring it back. My mom hasn't seen a quiz all school year. Sam just doesn't give a living shit. He only got one A, a B, and the rest were Cs and that one F. His teacher said to my mom You really have to try to get an F in this class. No one should get below a B. He also has a 1 year old niece that he used to dote on and play with all the time, and now she walks in the room and he doesn't take his eyes off the screen.


It might be relevant to note that in the last two years or so, he has started making comments about his weight. He feels fat (he is a little pudgy but nothing that won't work itself out after he hits puberty and his growth spurt) and refuses to wear anything except too big T shirts and baggy khaki cargos. My thinking is that he's being picked on at school about this.

We are both extremely extroverted and like to go play sports, go to soccer games, go to the gym, concerts, etc. We also enjoy indoor activities (I play tabletop RPG's, he is a painter) Boyfriend is not the problem.

My last relationship before dating boyfriend, I was in a rather bad long-term relationship: blowup fights where I had to deal with borderline verbal abuse, he would throw my stuff out windows when he was mad, he told me he would kill my family if I ever left, he would gaslight me and try to keep me away from my friends. I finally left that relationship and had been happily single for quite some time before boyfriend and I got together.

Best friend and I have been friends since middle school. We stayed friends through our (very tumultuous) early 20's and through living on opposite sides of the country. We've been there for each other through bad and good and terrible and wonderful. She was very supportive in my split with my ex, and helped me move. We used to get together all the time (at least once a week) in a group: her and her boyfriend (they had been together on and off for 3 years due to commitment issues on her end, but worked things out for the long-term), me, and several other friends which included both single people and couples.

She met my boyfriend before we started dating, and appeared to like him at first- they got on at a cookout we had, and at several social functions. However, she grew cold toward him rather quickly- she told me that she didn't like him, that other people in our friend group didn't like him, although no one else has said anything to me. He's very outgoing, like me, so I thought perhaps it was simply a personality clash: they are all extreme introverts and don't like to go out for activities unless it's going to a bar for trivia and drinking. (Neither boyfriend nor I are big drinkers, although I used to be). Of course not everyone will get along with everyone else all the time.

As time went on, I was getting invited to less and less group events, most of which were hosted by best friend and her boyfriend. Since this was my core group of friends, I was naturally distressed by this. I approached best friend, and she skirted around the issue, merely saying, we don't like him! and not giving any reasons why. She was so abrasive in this phone conversation that I wound up in tears. So I dropped the subject several months ago, and worked on cultivating other friendships while still letting her know regularly that she is my friend and I miss her. She recently told me when she stopped by the house that we could sit down over coffee and talk about why she doesn't like him, but at this point I feel as though the feelings are clear (boyfriend has noticed, but has brushed it off and is still nice to her) and I really don't want to sit down and hear all the reasons why she thinks my boyfriend sucks, when I'm in a happy and healthy place, or why we have to make a special meeting for it now when I've asked her so many times already and gotten brushed off.

Some things that I feel might be relevant: because I only had an introverted group of friends before I started dating boyfriend, I mostly hung out with our group of friends doing indoorsy-stuff, despite missing being active and working out and going to shows. Those type of things just aren't as enjoyable when doing them alone, which is why getting together with my boyfriend is so awesome. However, I still try to make time with my introverted friends, although my invitations often get declined.

Also, I was promoted recently, so I don't go out to bars on weeknights and I only occasionally go out on weekends. This is a change from when I was younger, but as I grow up, I find my interests changing. I no longer like to get drunk, I like waking up early on the weekends and being productive and active. Best friend still likes to go out drinking pretty hard at least once a week, as she is a student and has no job.

I'm just not sure what to do about it. I feel like I'm losing my best friend, and she doesn't want to hang out with me if my boyfriend is around. I don't get invited to many events, and my invitations to hang out get declined if there's the slightest chance that boyfriend will be around- however, she is still very excited to see me when we do run into each other, including when she accepts invitations to come to our house to hang out with our roommates. It's like no time has passed when we see each other again.

I met this guy in middle school. I think 8th grade, don't remember. He was already in high school, a grade above me. That summer we became friends and have been friends since then. We've grown very close over the years although it's been a struggle maintaining our friendship after he enlisted in the military, in part because I never saw him/rarely spoke and because we grew apart as people. But I tried to be there for him as much as I could, even after he was stationed in the Middle East for a while--I believe a year and a half to two years. It's all a blur because I had a lot of personal problems going on in my life and it's hard to keep a accurate timeline. I feel bad about that. 

My family, over time, began to notice that he had a crush on me. A few years ago he admitted it. I have my own personal problems with dating and didn't feel like we'd make a good match (and, frankly, I was very immature). Sometimes he'd say he'd accept my answer and then a year later would tell me he loved me again. It was cyclical. 

Finally, he came home for vacation last summer from the Middle East. We planned to take a road trip. I had *just* started driving on the thruway after battling an intense fear of driving (I had lost another good friend to a car accident a couple years prior and struck me practically disabled to only driving very plain backroads after several panic attacks). He was aware of this. In the coming weeks of our trip I suggested we finalize our transportation plans, I assumed we'd be taking a bus or train because he doesn't have his license. Nope. He said I was going to drive. Okay, fine, but we'd have to get a rental because my car is old and I can't risk it breaking in our three hour trip. And it definitely can't be bigger than a four door sedan. I can't drive trucks, mini-vans, SUV's, etc. He says no problem. The day I go to pick him and the car up? It's his sister's truck. The entire time we were driving up he was mad at me for being stressed out. 

We fought the entire vacation because I was on edge with his behavior. He was very cruel and insensitive. When I suggested he may have developed PTSD he was irritated and said he's fine. 

Before the vacation started (I believe the night before) I asked if it was strictly a friendly vacation. He said yes, that he was over me. The last night of our vacation he gave me a very expensive gold necklace (I believe it was over $1,000, my family thinks it was $2,500). This doesn't include the other gifts he gave me. At the time I was homeless and very poor so he kept insisting. I was torn between my stubbornness to not accept and how my family raised me, which was declining someone's gift is insulting. I accepted the other gifts he bought me during the week--video games, a hoodie, tshirt, shoes, etc--but not the necklace. We fought for an hour and he left our hotel for eight or so hours and came home early the next morning before we checked out. He said if I accepted the necklace--I wasn't planning on it regardless--that we would be expected to be together. 

Cut to a few months later. This past month I was sick. Couldn't afford  my meds. My family wasn't too keen on helping me out. He kept insisting on giving me the money. He leaves his barracks and goes into town during a snow storm (I had no idea it was going to snow, if I knew I would have told him not to worry) and wired me the money. Later, after I got the meds and took them, I said I felt better and thanked him profusely. He said he was glad to do it, that he wants to imagine me being happy, then asked for a picture of me smiling. That last bit raised a red flag for me but I complied. I forgot what else he said, but it was clear that he still liked me. I told him later to apologize for saying those things to me because it put me in a weird position. I felt compelled to basically agree with whatever he was saying/asking because he got me my meds and because he does all these other nice things for me. He apologized and then we fought a bit where he went off on a rant how he went through a snow storm for me and that's how I react. We fought, he apologized again, and we moved on. 

So, today we were talking. He asked if I could go up to see him (he's on a base three hours away) and I said I'd need a month to save money and get a rental car/request off from work. He said that's fine but that if I'm stressed out he's going to ask me to leave. I asked if I ever ignored him while he was stressed--the subtle point I was trying to make was that he's almost always stressed somehow and that I have to tiptoe with him. He was diagnosed with PTSD a few weeks ago. He said yeah, I do ignore him. 

I was tiffed and listed off a few times I had to help him calm down in the past couple months, including a time he texted me at 2am on my night off and I stayed up for an hour listening to him complain about a girl who pissed him off. His response was that I have bad qualities. I wanted to say EVERY human being has bad qualities and friends are supposed to accept them, but I became very depressed and didn't have the energy to say anything else, so I told him to leave me alone. 

I suffer from major depressive disorder. He knows this. He also knows, as of a week ago when I told him, that I've been suicidal for a long time. That I'm miserable. Every day is a struggle for me to function. You can imagine how hard I can be on myself. Some days when I'm off from work I'll spend the *entire day* in bed, only getting up to go to the bathroom and take my dog out. So hearing him say I have bad qualities really hit me hard. That when I'm stressed (not really stressed as I am depressed and having an anxiety attack), which is often, that I really am a terrible person. My family says that but  hearing my friend say it really hurts. I'm trying not to cry just typing this out. I feel like a shitty person. 

Sometimes when we fight he says I'm not a good friend. A week ago he didn't talk to me for a few days and when he did he wanted to talk on the phone. I said I couldn't because I'm home and I didn't want my family to hear my conversation with him (they want me to marry this guy and I'm trying *very hard* to keep my life with him private from them). That I wanted to text. And he was mad. He said I treat him like shit. That I'm thankless and ungrateful for the things he does for me. Even though I'm very mindful to say thank you every time he does something for me. 

I'm at my fucking wits end. I don't know what he wants from me. I talk to him every single day. I try to be there for him when he's going through something (which is difficult for me most days because I can barely function to take care of myself). I can't throw money at everything like he can. I *do not fucking know* what else he wants me to do. He makes me feel so shitty. I'm trying very hard to accommodate for him and help him transition from his military tour. 

He's also helping me pay for my car to get fixed, which is going to be anywhere from $900-2,000. I'm going to pay him back in installments. So I know he cares and I want to be mindful of that. But he can be so mean sometimes. Example, when we were driving to our vacation we stopped by McDonald's. I ordered myself food and didn't get him anything because one, I was freaking out from driving and exhausted and, two, thirty minutes prior when we were looking for somewhere to eat he said he wasn't hungry. He said I was selfish and wanted me to repeat it to him. Later that week I finally caved and tried to talk to him about the way he was acting/treating me and he said, But I buy you all these things and take care of you, so it's okay. He legitimately tried to justify his behavior with that. That's when I knew he really had changed, because the person I became friends with years ago wasn't like that. 

I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm starting to make excuses for him because of what he's going through. But I'm getting tired of his lack of empathy, consideration, and understanding. All my other friends are getting very pissed with him and on the other hand my family is pressuring me to be practically kissing his feet (in part because they want me to marry him). 

Right now we're not talking. But I don't know how to approach him when we start to talk this out. I don't want to be fighting with him.

So my Aunt Liz is throwing her annual BBQ this Saturday. I've known about it for a really long time and haven't been able to attend, I was planning on going this year, I HAVE been excited about it because it's a time I can just get drunk with a couple of my family members and shoot the shit... but..

Back in March, my mother suddenly passed away and I've been hit extremely hard with it. I'm still depressed, unmotivated, devastated and broken over it. I had to move in with my sister (Megan, 27) as I was living in a different province at the time but came back right after my mom passed. Since then I haven't been able to get my life together; I am unemployed, losing my social life, losing my confidence, lost all motivation, basically losing the will to live. It's been an extremely extremely difficult time in my life. 

Luckily, I have the support of my boyfriend, James. Even though hes expressed interest in wanting to be single without losing me (That's another story for another time, yes I know it sounds awful) he's been extremely patient and caring and loving. He also lives 2 minutes from my sister so I spend a lot of my time with James.

The plan was for this Saturday is to go to my Aunt Lizs BBQ at freaking noon and sleep in a tent... the thing is though, my sister and her boyfriend get to sleep in their nice roomy car while James and I need to find our own tent (we don't have one) and sleep in a tent in a small-ish backyard around tons of people who I don't know (The people there will be all from my aunts family, my aunt liz is my dads brothers ex wife) so I don't know anyone except for Megan, James, megans boyfriends, my aunt and my cousin (Aunts son) Daniel (20 years old). 

However, last week I started to get social anxiety over this bbq. My sister has a really good big adult job, as does her boyfriend... and for some reason, EVERYONE'S go to questions are always What do you do for work? Oh you don't work? Are you looking for work? No? Why not? What are you looking for? hey I have some unwanted advice I am going to annoyingly give you because I suddenly just know EVERYTHING about you! , that type of shit drives me insane, makes me so embarrassed and makes me feel pathetic and uncomfortable. Truth is, I am NOT looking for work right now... I am still grieving everyday. I still get waves of heavy emotion. I am comfortable just sitting in my own bed of depression at the moment while TRYING to get out there sometimes and enjoy a few social interactions with my boyfriend and his friends. I also didn't graduate college, I went for TV broadcasting and when people ask me what I did in college and I tell them, they always ask oh cool what are you doing with it now?? and my response ... um.. nothing? because they don't know I didn't graduate and therefore they seem to think I can just walk into any studio and demand a job... which doesn't fucking happen unless my Uncle is best friends with Conan O'Brien or something.

Also, my boyfriend can't make the BBQ either. A job interview came up for him and he can't miss it. So now that's an ENTIRE day, with people I don't know, being really uncomfortable and trying to get wasted starting at NOON, sleeping in a tent and interacting uncomfortably by myself. I just can't do it yet! I haven't been in such a large crowd since my mothers funeral. I just don't want to do it. I see no fun for me sitting around and feeling awkward for 24 hours.

I've been too afraid to confront my sister Megan about this, Megan can be a very judgemental person and sometimes makes me feel like shit. I know for a fact she'd be mad and does the whole urgh seriously? come on just come, it'll be fun. I've already expressed my concerns to my cousin Dan and he did the same thing. At first he said omg I totally understand but then drifted off to trying to give me advice on how to just... get past it and to just come and get drunk as fuck I don't know how to explain to people I am uncomfortable, I just don't want to come which you think that should be all it takes but nope! You have to suffer 20 minutes of Aww come on! Why? Just come. It'll be fun. You'll get to hang out with me! Just drink a lot. They'll be jello shots!. I feel like I need to be puking my guts out or have extremely contagious pink eye in order for people to not question me as to why I can't come to this fucking bbq because saying I have social anxiety about it isn't enough!

Since my mom passed, my family (especially my other aunt on my moms side) has been trying to really get it on my life and as much as I understand why and I appreciate it, I find it very annoying especially when they continuously ask me Have you found a job yet?? and when I tell the truth and say I'm not really looking yet, they say finding a job can really pass the time and help you with blah blah blah and I just want to scream I DONT WANT A FUCKING JOB. They seem to think I can only live my life and have a personality if I have a fucking boring as shit 9-5 job or a serving job etc etc. It's the go to question EVERYTIME and explaining to strangers why I don't want a job and this and that is something I do not want to be doing all day Saturday. 

I've already put my foot down on not wanting to go. Now I just don't know how to message my Aunt Liz about it, I was thinking of just saying something came up and I'm so sorry, but I'm not sure if Daniel has already told her or not. 

Also, another thing that has got me SO upset, is my other cousin, Kevin, who is about 40 years old.. has been a decent supporter of my life and is a really cool, calm and collect man. He has a great job, owns his own house etc etc and is just generally doing well for himself. We seldomly meet up for breakfast and talk about how shitty my life is. Anyways, the other night we were texting about why I don't want to go to the BBQ (he is not going either)... and he then asked Do you think your life would be different if you came to live with me and Sarah (his daughter)? because he asked if I wanted to move in with him and Sarah after college but instead I went to a live with my best friend in a different province and I don't regret it because it was my first time out of province and I had an amazing experience and met my boyfriend there etc etc so I said Well, I wouldn't have had my amazing experience in this province, I wouldn't have met my boyfriend and I wouldn't have been able to live independently on my own! and he asks Have you lived independently on your own? which made me SOO mad and upset, because I moved out of my home when I was 18 and have lived and worked and went to school and paid my rent ALL on my OWN with absolutely no help from anyone! From 18 to 25 I have been completely independent and for him to question that (because he KNOWS all of this) was extremely hurtful and I was flabbergasted... which to me just proves my point about Saturday! 

This also has happened with a lot of other people... because I use the tactic of making fun of myself in front of others to relieve awkward tension... they feel that makes it okay to make fun of me too... which I know I'm asking for it if I'm the one who starts it.. but it still makes me feel like shit!! Just little comments here and there that make my tears swell in anger and embarrassment. Once, my aunt (moms side) and our lawyer were coming over to my sisters house one early morning to discuss things.. my sisters living room window faces the parking lot and the window was open... my sister goes down to meet them and let them in, and I hear hellos and hugs and how are yous... then I heard my aunt ask is so and so here?? and my sister was like yep and my aunt says Wow I'm surprised she's up this early! and I'm thinking.. 'are you fucking kidding me?? How do you know when I wake up??? I could be waking up at 7am everyday for all you know! but for some reason you're assuming I sleep in till like 3 pm everyday?? WTF.' I just couldn't believe it. Another example for THAT same morning... the lawyer handed both my sister and I a sheet to keep.. my sister has this big red binder that we keep ALL important documents in.. so I looked over the sheet and handed it over to my sister to place into the binder and for some reason everyone found this funny and my aunt says yeah gave it to Megan because so and so will lose it! and again... all I kept thinking was... get fucked. Seriously? Since when have I lost ANYTHING in front of you for you to assume I'm a clumsy fool?? 

All in all, I am tired of being looked down at, people thinking I'm lazy and unmotivated... people just seem to forget all I've done for myself the past 8 years... all they see now is that I'm unemployed and therefore just a nobody. 

Not to mention I am also losing my friends. TWO... not just one but TWO of my best friends since high school, who I've still been bffs with have completely abandoned me. I know that just shows they're shitty people... but man does that still fucking STING knowing they just cut me out of their life (one of them explained it's because she needs to surround herself with positive people). 

I know this post turned into a rant about my shitty life right now, but I still need to advice on what to do about Saturday. I don't want to suck it up and go. If at like 5pm I need out of there, I am STUCK. A cab home would be like 100 dollars. What do I tell my aunt liz? I've actually already told my sister about not wanting to go and of course she did the whole Aunt Liz will be upset, why dont you just go? invite a friend? (I don't discuss my personal life with my sister because he constantly gives me cocked eye looks and responds with oookkaayy... A LOT, so little does she know I haven't seen a single one of my friends since being here) I'm sure Aunt Liz will have a spot for you to sleep on etc etc ... she just doesn't understand that the once extroverted and quirky funny girl is gone right now. 

Help! Also any other advice on how to handle this life is also appreciated. 

Also, last thing... my sister even suggested Why don't you just tell everyone you work for me?? Helping me make web content for my website etc etc and I'm just so frustrated because that doesn't help ME at all, it'll just make me feel like even more shit about myself knowing I have to lie to others to make me look good. I don't mean to use the cliche, eye roll quote of the century... but.. people just don't understand me!! lol I'm sure I can continue going on and ON about everything I am feeling and thinking but I've gone on for too long already so... I can continue explaining more to anyone interested!

TLDR: I do not want to go to my aunts BBQ Saturday because I am getting social anxiety over any questions about my plans for my life as I have none right now.

24882,Non-Romantic,2dhuci,"Hi. So I got my turtle, who's name is Turtle (or Principal Bellington) from my ex-boyfriend. We swapped pets while we were dating because I liked Turtle more than I liked my parrotlet, who LOVES my ex-boyfriend, enough to do the mating dance to him.          
              
Anyway, since we broke up about 2 years ago, I have moved Turtle from his place to my mother's house where I live. She really enjoys Turtle, and I work a lot so she has something to play with while no one is home. It's great that she's taken an interest in him, but there's some things that really concern me.                 
              
* She keeps taking him outside even though he has already had a case of mites from being outside, and I'm really afraid that she will lose him, even though she swears my dog keeps an eye on him.           
                  
* She keeps leaving him alone unsupervised (aside from my **DOG**) in our living room, where she leaves the door open, that leads to the cellar, and there is a huge hole in our wall were a furnace vent is and we can't put a vent cover on it because the wall is damaged and needs replaced before it can hold a vent cover.              
                  
This second one can be easily fixed if she would just put something over the vent, or shove a pillow in there, but she refuses to do it and I've found my efforts to be in vain.                   
              
I tried telling her a dozen times, to the point where I am angry at her for keeping up with this. The other week I found him roaming around in the living room and she didn't even bother to tell me he was out, and my dogs weren't even in the house to keep an eye on him!              
              
He is really mischievous, quiet and sneaky. I have let him out in my room once and he got under the door and went into my mother's room where she hoards everything, and couldn't find him for half an hour until I thought I saw a snake and it turned out to be his head, and I was keeping an eye on him, I just turned for a second to grab something. (BTW, turtles are surprisingly fast) She has less awareness of her surroundings, and slower reflexes, I have no clue how she could possibly keep track of him. Before he was let out in the living room, she would leave him in the kitchen with her, and he would always go to the the side of the refrigerator because it was hot, and that was no problem, because we always knew he was there, and she would atleast be in the same room as him, but not anymore! She lets him roam free and I'm worried about him, because I can't keep my eye on him all day due to work.                
                   
So the only option I have now is to give him back to my ex. I have tried to ask her, to tell her, to demand her to keep him in the same room as her, to not leave him alone in a room with a hole to a furnace, and to not rely on a **DOG** to watch him, but she refuses to listen to me even though he is my pet.

I have to be up by 6 every day and often times I don't even get home until 6 or 7 at night.  From there until about 10, I usually am doing homework and then going to bed. I need a solid 7-8 hours of sleep or I simply cannot function the following day, so I try to go to bed at or near 10. 

My roomates, on the other hand, have all the fucking time in the world.  Every fucking night they're inviting people over. Now, I wouldn't mind at all except they're fucking *loud*.  Like, they have no concept of inside voices at all. 

Every night I have had to ask them please be quieter, I need to sleep and you're very loud! and they say oh yeah, sure, sorry. and go back to being just as loud as they originally were. My bedroom is right next to the tv/common area where they congregate, so there is no escaping it. 

I don't know how i feel about asking to set up house rules of QUIET TIME AFTER 10 OR 11, but I don't know what to do.

24905,Non-Romantic,1rup3m,"I don't have much friends anyway. None of them are girls so I'm one step behind needing actual romantic relationship advice to start with (girls usually avoid me).
The first time since weeks a friend asked me to get drinks together with his group (some girls too). Normally I just ask other people to do something and get mostly rejections because I can't connect with anyone socially so nobody really wants to hang out with me (but most people don't hate me either). So this was a big deal for me.

So I was more confident than usual and tried my best to have conversations there with him and other people but all the time he said shit like be glad I asked you to come today, I didn't even wanted to it was just a random thought, so consider yourself lucky and nobody likes you here anyway be glad I asked you out. He also made uncalled comments about that I'm not part of this group of friends just because I'm there with them today. When I said I have to go he said finally! and shit like that. He isn't like that to me when we are talking 1on1 so I don't know why he felt the need to make these comments. Once I confronted him about it he just said I shouldn't take it personally. I was glad to get out of the house but now I just feel really depressed about this whole thing afterward. I can't cut him off instantly because I don't know many people and I guess he knows that and uses this to boost his own ego. 

I don't know what to do in these situations. He's not the only one that treats me like this, however this extreme case was what motivated me to make this post. Other people I consider friends (we know us a long time and I usually can talk with them) are not really directly mean to me like this but they generally don't give a shit about me. None of them remembers my birthday and if I wouldn't contact them I would never hear from them again. I never get involved into their plans from the start. I can somtimes go out with them if they happen to have a free place in a car and I ALWAYS have to invite myself. 

Part of me says it's their fault, I shouldn't take shit from anybody and I don't need these kind of friends. Another part of me says that I'm the constant in this and it's my fault for my unabitly to properly connect with people, so I should be glad for every person that is willing to do something with me from time to time. I haven't cut anybody off to this day because I know that they won't give a shit about it anyway and  I just end up completely alone, so that's really my only alternative if I don't want to be a complete shut-in which would make my chance to get a girlfriend even lower than they are now (I don't have experience with girls and I'm mid 20 already so this puts a lot of pressure on me too).

24909,Non-Romantic,38le3a,"My [27 F] mother [55 F] is getting remarried. I'm all for my mom being happy after her unhappy marriage to my father. However, I see warning flags with this new relationship, and whether her children could actually attend was of little concern when she started planning the wedding.

Problems with marriage:

* Both my mother and her fiancé [59 M] are alcoholics in denial, and I don't believe a healthy relationship is possible when alcohol is a problem. My parents were both alcoholics throughout their marriage, and it ended in divorce once my dad [55 M] got cleaned up and she stayed the same. I fear marrying another alcoholic will either end the same way or prevent my mom from realizing her problem and getting cleaned up. I know her alcoholism already threatens her life, but I feel like her life is further endangered by him drinking and driving when they go out on the town. 

* My parents were well off, and I believe she remained in a strong financial position after the divorce (~ 3 years ago). Her fiancé has been married twice before and supposedly lost most of his money in those divorces. He does have a house that is now a rental while they live in one of my mom's three houses. He also does not seem to work much and also does not seem to be the wisest with money (He buys my mom a dozen roses every week. I understand the gesture, but the novelty has to wear off after a while). I have to wonder if he is in the relationship for money. I would hate to see her lose part of her estate in a divorce when I really don't see this marriage lasting. I also worry that if something were to happen to my mom before him (you never know with alcoholics), the house will go to him and then his children when he is gone.

* The relationship has been rushed. He moved in after a couple of months, then they started talking about marriage a few months later. At least they waited until almost 1.5 years in to get married.

* Personal issue: I don't care to spend any significant time with this guy. He is all about BSing and small talk, stretching the truth, acting like he knows it all, and I'm an introvert more interested in intellectual conversation. It makes me want to be around less, meaning less time with my mom.

Problems with the actual wedding:

* We have another wedding scheduled for the same day (these happen to be the only two weddings we have this summer). We have known about this one since late last summer when we received a save the date. It is my husband's good friend who was the officiant at our wedding. Normally we would prioritize this one, but we found out about the engagement through Facebook. My husband is clearly no longer on the list of people to call before making the Facebook announcement nor have the two of them talked since the engagement. This has created a sense of distance in that relationship.

* My mother hinted at getting married in a text three months before the wedding, then officially told me a month later. I told her of our conflict, but the wedding was already set in stone. She had coordinated with her parents and siblings who already had tickets to fly out, and other wedding arrangements had already been made. Don't ask me why she failed to coordinate with her children at the same time.

* The friend's wedding is 80 miles a way. My mom's is 9 hours away and requires days off work for my husband. It is already hard for him to get days off in the summer, and we have a week long vacation planned in August (which I want to point out is a gift from my dad because of the next bullet point). His vacation days for the year will be exhausted, meaning we won't be able to travel to see family over the holidays like usual.

* We are on a very tight budget, and were not given enough notice to plan and save to make the trip to my mom's.

* My brother was planning to go to the wedding, but now he likely is not. He can not afford to, and also realized he had strong feelings against the wedding as well. I was feeling guilty about not going if he went, but not as guilty now if he does not go.

* It's two days before my birthday. I know this probably shouldn't bother me, but I really don't want to associate my birthday and my mom's remarriage.

After I tell my story what I need help with is A) deciding if my mother has been abusive B) deciding if I should cut her out of my life

So all throughout my childhood my mums been pretty messed up, hitting us and screaming at us (my siblings and I) and calling us names (bitch, whore, fat, idiot, stupid, liar, cow, disgusting, ugly etc) she has also told us we'll never have friends or boyfriends because of how we are. She would scream these things at us almost daily and usually for something small (eg left a carrot in my schoolbag, piece of lego on the ground) Usually the screaming was accompanied with hitting us on the legs or butt (around 11 she started hitting me in the face instead) She was neglectful too, I packed my own school lunches from k-12 she also never helped me brush my hair or teeth so I never learnt to. She would tell us we were lying if we felt sick and would never take us to a doctor. ( my sister and I would get huge staph infections,that can poison your blood and kill you, on our legs to the point where we could hardly walk and couldn't play sport at school. These could have been fixed easily with antibiotics. Instead she would wait til they were huge then pop them for her own sick pleasure. Having them popped was like torture, we'd scream our heads off, cry and plead. I remember her forcing us to do it to ourselves or she'd do it and make it hurt worse. These infections would swell our eyes up and leave us faint,clammy and feverish) I also remember at the age of 8 being suicidal, i would go into the kitchen and hold a knife to my chest saying I would kill myself. She would ignore it or get my siblings to laugh at me. (I have no anger towards my siblings they were influenced by her) She made my sister and I horse ride from a young age (think dancemums but with horses) and would force us to do it even when we felt sick, had diarrhea or didn't want to. She would scream at us if we didn't ride how she wanted and would also whip the shit out of our horses if they misbehaved while we cried amd begged her to stop. I have a memory of her making me go into the living room and saying she was going to put a medical cream on my vagina but I was old enough to do that myself and I can't recall needing a cream. I think she molested me but I hate to think about it. She also said things to me like  I used to suck your brothers cute little penis when he was a baby and then denied it. I seem to remember her making me let her touch me in the living room a lot but I also can't remember well at all. It feels off and I feel like it might nit be real or that no one will believe me. I don't live with her anymore vut still feel a constant guilt to stay in contact with her. Theres more things she did but from this do you think she's abusive and do you think I should cut contact? Visiting her always leaves me stressed and anxious.

24921,Non-Romantic,2tl4q8,"My friend Scott and I met in high school and have been best friends for 15 years. We have a small, but tight group of high school friends, but we all live in different parts of the state now so we only get everyone together 5 or 6 times a year.

Scott has been dating his girlfriend for over a year. She's his first serious girlfriend. She's becoming increasingly difficult to deal with and it seems like everything has to go through her. Her signature move is to arrange plans that conflict with ours and force him (or us) to comply. He isn't helping the situation because he does whatever she wants. He seems happy in his relationship though.

She's never stopped us from catching up altogether, but this time was different.

We were meant to catch up this weekend, but I couldn't make it down to our usual meeting place 1.5hrs away where 2 of our other friends live. I've been down every other time last year, so I suggested they come up to visit me instead. My housemates were away for the weekend so there was plenty of space for everyone to crash for the night, and we'd have the house to ourselves for a BBQ dinner and drinks. Everything was coming up Milhouse.

Scott and his girlfriend were staying at my other friend's place 1.5hrs away. When they arrived things started going south. My other friend texted me saying that Scott's girlfriend was making it obvious she was not at all keen to come up tomorrow. She suggested we meet at another place, which was further away and less convenient. She then said her friend was coming down from where I live to visit her tomorrow and gave me the ultimatum that I could come down with her friend if I wanted to catch up with them (first I heard of that). She has been trying to set me up with her single friends since we met but I'm not interested, so I politely declined. Anyway, that conflicted with our BBQ plans which I'd already prepared for. So she's gone ahead and made other plans expecting all of us to just be cool with it.

Long story short, she makes a big scene about not wanting to come up, then her and Scott go off the radar and won't answer or return messages/calls all day, despite the messages being read. Finally Scott calls me, he sounds like he genuinely wants to catch up but says that it will be 'difficult' and makes up some BS excuse for why they're flaking. At this point I've had enough and decide to just get on with my day, assuming all plans for catching up are off.

Later that day Scott's girlfriend messages us in a group chat, Where's everyone at? We are in town. Just dropped [Scott's brother] and his girlfriend off in the city. Come into the city and we'll go out for dinner. I reply, Sorry, can't make it, I'm at the beach. Didn't hear from you so assumed you guys weren't coming up. Message me if you can make it to the beach. No reply.

So it turns out, after all the complaining about coming up, Scott and his girlfriend actually made the trip up to drop Scott's brother and his girlfriend off in the city, and then had the nerve to suggest we go out for dinner when I've already prepared the BBQ we were meant to have (which I'll probably be eating all week now!)

On top of all this, a couple of months ago I arranged for Scott and his girlfriend to stay at my place when they were up visiting. Scott confirmed that they would stay at my place. We had been out in the city and they didn't know how to get back to where their car was parked, so I helped them get back to their car. I assumed we would all just go together back to my place in their car as I'd caught the train into the city to meet them. When we got to their car they said, Oh by the way, we're staying at [girlfriend's friend's house] tonight. They didn't even offer me a lift and just left me in the city by myself late at night. I was furious. I walked to the train station and took the train home.

Scott has changed heaps since he's been with his girlfriend but I don't really feel like its my place to say anything. How do I stop his girlfriend from fucking up our friendship? I can't believe he just stands by as she does this sort of shit to his friends?

I don't feel like its my place to say anything to him about his relationship, it's his relationship, not mine. But I'm open to other people's suggestions. What's happening here and how do I deal with it without insulting him about his girlfriend's behaviour?

It was like we wouldn't see each other for a month but then immediately fall right back to where we were. I always considered her a true friend. She has been there for me through tough times and good times alike. 

She's always been a bit no nonsense, but lately it's out of control. As it happens, I am in her state for a month of work and I was going to just rent my own place, but she insisted I stay with her. So now I've been spending a lot of time with her, and realizing what a nightmare it must be to live with her full time, or possibly why zero of her romantic relationships work out. 

She takes EVERY opportunity she can to be a bitch-- towards me or anyone. I happen to be around her a lot now, so she will take every and any shot she can. She does this because she will constantly proclaim how people are stupid and I have no tolerance for idiots. It will be as small as, her door is open and I will jokingly yell, Can I come in? ARE YOU NAKED? which, a few years ago, would have prompted some giggles. Now, she snarls back, Of course I'm not, you moron. Why would I be stupid enough to keep my door open if I was? 

Literally the dumbest jokes are met with some horrible reply. I jokingly said I know you're just jealous and want a slice of my man when she was teasing me about something regarding my partner of many years, and she said, deadpan, Ew, no. I definitely wouldn't want any of that. Which, considering I'm dating him, love him, and find him attractive, is pretty hurtful. 

The worst part is that she has a very obsessive personality-- she went through drug phases, drinking phases, many different career phases, where she will focus on nothing but whatever it is she's obsessed with. She's now a workout junkie, and I have the unforgivable sin of being about 20 lbs overweight. To be fair, I have a lady disease (PCOS) that doesn't help matters, and I never used to be this chub, and am working on it! I really am. I work out and walk a ton, and am seeing a doctor about it to try to figure this out, because guess what, I hate being overweight too! But she will take EVERY opportunity to point it out. She'll ask Did you go to the gym today? Why are you making excuses? or if I will be like Oh lord, this is heavy she'll laugh Well you never work out, so of course it will be hard for you.

I know everyone on reddit will cry CUT HER OUT OF YOUR LIFE! SHES HORRIBLE! but she has literally been my friend for YEARS and I just want to find a way to get her to at least back off a little. I'm a very easy going person which can be to my detriment sometimes. I don't know how a sit down talk would go over with her-- I feel like she'd dismiss it and say I can't deal when people fuck up so I just have to say something but I don't know if there's any way to just immediately correct the problem, such as say, You don't need to be so harsh. or something. It's driving me nuts :(

24946,Non-Romantic,2u8cbj,"Hello r/relationships. I am posting because I am in a situation which I cannot handle, and should not be the one handling, but due to the dynamics of the relationship between me and my parents have been brought into. My parents have been married for 25 years, I am an adult and am completely financially independent from them, however, I have several sibling some of whom still live at home and are still dependent upon my parents. Because of this and my own desire to have a stable family, as well as the desire that my family members all be happy and content in their relationships, I have a vested interest in helping as much as possible with the situation and will do anything within my power to do so.

My father does not have many close friendships and is a guarded and fairly socially conservative person, I am the only person he has told about these suspicions and thus far have been the only person able to talk through them with him. I have told him that I shouldn't be the person talking to him about this, both because I cannot take sides and because I am not very experienced in long term relationships, or at least stable, healthy ones. That said he does not have other friends who he could bring it up with, and is not willing to talk to a professional, with or without my mother, though that has been my constant suggestion for them.

The issue is that recently my father has begun to suspect marital infidelity, perhaps not sexual but at least emotional infidelity on the part of my mother. His suspicion is that she has or is having relationships with other women that go beyond the bounds of an appropriate friendship. His suspicions are based upon some emails which have been deleted, upon giving of gifts and physical closeness such as hugging between my mother and other women, upon things which have been said within their relationship, and what I believe are extremely unfair relationship dynamics. Some example of these things are;

-My mother believes that it is appropriate to have a marriage of convenience, that is to say marry someone who they do not fully and completely love in order to better their own life situation. She believes this is alright because of the limitations of single women in the world, the social stigma of being a 'spinster', and the belief that it is better for children to grow up in a household with two parents who at least present the illusion of stability.

-My father does not believe it is appropriate for someone in a relationship to associate one on one with a member of the opposite sex, or with a homosexual member of the same sex. My mother disagrees, arguing that my father should trust in her sexuality, and that she should be allowed to associate with homosexual women, given that they have several kids and still have an active sex life. 

-My mother dated a gay man before my father in order to have a stable relationship, my mother says this is because she did not desire a sexual relationship at that point in her life. My father believes it is because she on some level has homosexual tendencies and having a relationship with a man was a means to hide them. 

-My mother treats my father poorly at times, telling him he is lazy or does not put in effort or do the things he needs to, or giving him guilt trips in order to get what she wants. I have experienced this as well and can tell you she is extremely good at getting what she wants, and does not have an issue making someone feel terrible to get it. I have broken down into tears at times because of this. I recall having a panic attack due to spilling some laundry detergent a few years ago because of how bad I felt about making a mess, my mother is a perfectionist and cannot stand any chaos or discord. This is likely due to the fact that she was raised in a very unstable household with an abusive, alcoholic father, in extreme poverty, and was bullied as a child due to her upbringing. While I understand where her motivations lie I do not agree with her means of pursuing them.

-My mother has only worked 3 out of the last 25 years, though she was home to raise me and my siblings, an agreement her and my father mutually agreed to years ago but that has lasted much longer than it was supposed to. That said my father travels for work and typically works 60 to 80 hour weeks, not including travel time, and does not have any close friendships, hobbies, or pursuits, his entire life is devoted to maintaining our family, and the lifestyle my mother desires. He has desired for a long time to stop traveling, work less, and spend more time with the family, my mother has disagreed telling him to continue working and traveling in order to maintain their lifestyle.

-When my father is not working he almost always is doing something to improve the house or better our families lifestyle, the same goes for me. In my entire time growing up I rarely spent time with my father unless we were working on the house or car. In the last five years I have not spent more than an hour at a time with my father one on one, and those times it has been because I was driving him to work or helping him with a project around the house. I enjoy golfing, skiing, and plenty of other activities which my father also enjoys, we have done none of them, not once since I left high school and very very rarely before that, I could count these times on one hand, and even during them my father was typically on the phone with work or worrying about the argument which will occur when we arrived back home and were berated for enjoying ourselves by my mother.

-To be clear my family is very well off (except for myself but that is due to my choosing to major in biology...) my parents live in a large house in an affluent area, my sibling attend a good school, have expensive clothes and accessories, participate in extremely expensive sports programs, and generally have anything they could want. Further my parents do not have a budget, I have told my father many times that if they were to create a budget and limit themselves they would be much happier. My mother is unwilling to abide by a budget, my father is responsible for making sure there is always enough money to get her what she wants, if not she claims he is being abusive or neglectful.

Based on all this I have told my father the following things;
-He should be talking to a professional about this, someone experienced in financial issues in a marriage, as well as unfair relationship dynamics.

-That it is unfair for him to not have a life of his own, he truly does not have any friends or outside pursuits, our family and work is his entire life, and he does not enjoy his job.

-That his suspicions of infidelity by my mother are most likely unfounded, he really has no evidence for this apart from interactions which I believe are totally normal, but which he believes are wrong due to the fact he does not have close friendships. He sees these relationships as a threat to his own with my mother, and given how invested he is in this relationship I understand his fears.

-I've told him that though his fear of infidelity is unfounded the reasons he his having these fears is based off of an extremely biased relationship dynamic and that, though they may be unfounded, the reasons he is having them are based on real issues that he needs to resolve.

He will not listen, he knows that my mother should be allowed to have friendships with other women, but he cannot get past the distrust. He wont listen and refuses to believe their are other issues, or that they need therapy in any way shape or form. For the last 20 years he has always believed that making a little bit more money, or getting that new car, or having that nicer house, will make everything better. But there is no light at the end of the tunnel, whenever he gets these things there is always another new thing the family needs to be happy, so he works just as hard to get that next thing. I am at a loss on how to convince him things need to change. 

I CANNOT talk to my mother about these things, I have tried confronting her about various issues in the past, it has always ended with me feeling extremely guilty and wrong to the point I have considered not even associating with my family. That said I love my mother, father, and siblings completely, I simply cannot change how she is or influence her in any way, she is too smart and manipulative. 

I cannot deal with this myself anymore. I work in skilled trades and need to be in my right mind. The stress from this has been causing me to not be able to sleep at night. I work high in the air with no safety systems and if I fall I will die, I need to be able to balance on two by fours with a fifty foot drop on one side and walk on icy steep roofs. I cannot do so when I only get two hours of sleep a night. 

I fell off a ladder two months ago and hurt my back, I still work in constant paint, I worked through it anyway. I am already extremely stressed about my job, the fact that my car barely runs, the fact that I have poor relationships and no money, that I could die any day at my job and I still do it because I need the money. I am a modern day indentured servant based off of how my boss has 'helped' me (he loaned me money so I would be able to keep my car running so I could get to work, until I pay him back I can't really quit, but I barely make any money to pay him so I am trapped there for at least a few months, since loaning the money he has stopped caring about my safety and has been making me do these unsafe things because they save him time and money and he knows I can't quit, and because other more experienced people do them so why shouldn't I?).

All this is not to ask for help with my own issues, they are mine to deal with and I am doing so, I have already paid off a significant amount of money and have cut back on all expenses and outside pursuits in order to get out and move on to a better place, in addition to studying and pursuing my professional abilities. 

I can help myself, I cannot help my parents...so tell me what to do, tell me anything, talk to me, please, anything at would be amazing, I am at a loss and cannot think anymore, my heart is racing as I type this I so stressed about it please anything at all is appreciated.

24958,Non-Romantic,34hxi1,"Hello Redditors,
I need a little bit of advice or someone to tell me I'm being silly if I am. I'm getting married next week and I'm absolutely over the moon. However, my future brother in law, my husband's only sibling, has just told us that he will be leaving our wedding reception after the meal as him and his girlfriend need to go home and get rested for their vacation which they are leaving for at lunchtime the next day.

This means that they'll be leaving our wedding at 7pm, despite the fact that our reception lasts until midnight. I'm aware that staying until the bitter end isn't everyone's cup of tea, but my husband is upset because he always imagined at his wedding one of the last guests to leave would be his brother. 

My BIL is going on vacation with his girlfriend of 10 months, and since he started dating her he's changed. He's always taken away from family events early, doesn't get to see us on holidays until he's spent time with her family etc. I've always let it go because it's none of my business, but I am hurt that they're now going to leave my wedding early and use their vacation the next day as a convenient excuse. Am I being silly?

How do you think my husband and I should handle this situation? Or should we just leave it? Thanks for your advice.

24964,Non-Romantic,39212c,"I've always been good at school (4.2 GPA) and I work extremely hard for it. I didn't get the Honor Roll in middle school because I got a C in PE. When I was in 8th grade, my mom consistently told me near the end of the year that I didn't deserve my allowance, or my prom dress, because I wouldn't be getting any awards at the ceremony. Why would I bother looking nice if I'm not valedictorian, or doing anything special to stand out? She yelled at me the entire ride home, about how I'm not going to be successful because I'm like the 95% of the people who didn't receive awards. That was one of the worst days of my life. It was supposed to be a happy ceremony, but she completely ruined it by comparing me to others, and reducing me to tears. I understand she was disappointed, but I still feel like she should've been proud of me regardless.

The same thing with PE class happened again, in high school, so I won't be on the Honor Roll. Of course, I was super disappointed. I made sure to be speaking at graduation (not valedictorian, but AP speaker for 2 subjects) just to please her, because I know I won't be getting any awards. It doesn't help that I got rejected from my top 2 universities, and will be taking a gap year. My parents really disapprove, but I think it'll be a good opportunity to see what I actually want to study.

Anyway, I asked her for money the other day to pay for my prom dress. She asked again in the condescending tone, why she has to pay for a loser. It's okay if she doesn't pay, because I can afford to pay for it myself. It's not okay, that she brings this shit up again. I told her, that if she's going to yell at me and verbally abuse me again on my class's special day, it's probably better if she didn't come. I said this in the most apologetic and sensitive way possible, after days of thought. Of course I want her to come to my graduation, I just don't want to spend it crying in my room like last time. She's been supportive of me throughout most of my academic career, it's just graduations when she releases her disappointment.

Still, is it too much to ask for her to at least act like she's proud of me on my high school graduation day?

I fully understand her disappointment. I was disappointed in me, too. I really wanted to go to university this year, and I really wanted to get the Honor Roll this time. However, these things didn't happen the way I want them to and there's nothing I can do to change it now. 

When I told her it's better not to come to my graduation if she's going to act the way she did last time, she told me to move out. She interpreted Get out of my life from Don't come to my graduation if you're going to be abusive. So... she told me to move out. I'm pretty sure this is an empty threat but it's gone too far. I don't know what to do. I want her to come to my graduation, she's just taking it the wrong way. I understand she is extremely hurt from this, but she doesn't know how I feel, even though I poured out my heart.

I honestly don't know what to do at this point.

24966,Non-Romantic,33zam7,"So, like many people, I have friends from high school that I still occasionally hang out with.  My group of friends from high school was basically 6 males and myself and my best friend.  I never dated any of them and I never had any feelings for them. It just wasn't a thing.  We were friends and have been since high school, not a big deal as we rarely ever see each other and I am cool (even friends) with the one's who are married wives (or so I thought) and none of my boyfriends have ever had an issue with these guy friends.  

So tonight it looks like I might see everyone again, my best male friend is in town and we are talking about a poker game.  His girlfriend(Haley) and I are super cool, our kids are friends, we've even dated a couple of the same guys and still are totally fine with each other.  Earlier we were having a play date when she tells me last time she saw one of the guys (Jack) and his wife(Sandy), Haley mentioned she might be seeing me soon. Jacks wife said Oh say hi to my bestfriend and when I was told this I laughed wondering wtf she is talking about, I've met Sandy maybe two times, what an odd thing to say... I had no idea she thought we were good friends! Haley continues yea she was talking about how she doesn't like you because she can tell you have a major crush on Jack  My jaw damn near on the floor I could not help but almost fall over laughing. This is absolutely preposterous.  I have no idea what she is talking about, I think Haley may just be blowing a small conversation up, there is no way some one I barely know thinks I like her husband who I may see once or twice a year. 

I check facebook, Sandy is still my friend(she actually added me right before they were engaged, I had never physically met her and usually wouldn't accept the request of someone I didn't know but figuring it's jacks girlfriend, I would be nice) but then I see that he has me blocked!!!  I have no idea how to approach this situation. I never met Sandy til after she was married to jack.  I've interacted with her twice. I was not invited to the wedding and she blamed it on a mix up of invitations, but now that I look back on all interactions this girl has clearly hated me from day 1 and I have no clue as to why. I don't know what to do guys. Id have never even known I was blocked from her husbands facebook had I not heard this tday, like I have never had any type of feeling for this guy, he was honestly my least favorite of the bunch! I will say he has grown up to be handsome man, but still! So what?!  What the fuck is this?!

25002,Non-Romantic,2x0ghp,"This situation is quite complicated and will need a little back ground story before I get to my problem. Last month I ended a four year relationship with my partner, Mark. It wasn’t a bad break up, we didn’t fight or yell. I didn’t feel the same anymore and want to be friends instead of lovers. The two of us share a house with two friends, one of which is my best friend, Charlie. 

On the day of the break up I explained in depth to Mark how I felt about our relationship and he explained how he felt. It was very emotional but neither of us hate each other. For some time I had been confused about how I felt about Mark, I didn’t enjoy his company as much anymore and at times became very irritable around him. I was also no longer affectionate without Mark initiating it. I was spending a lot more time with Charlie which was fun but I could see my friendship with Charlie growing closer and my relationship with Mark growing distant. This left me in a very confused place. 

I didn’t want our relationship to turn bitter and knew pretending was the worst thing I could do at that point. Mark still loves me. He needs time to heal and move on, which is difficult while we still live together but we are obligated by contract to still live together for the majority of the year. This concerns me deeply and I have attempted to give him as much space as possible but at times he behaves like we’re still together, doing things out of habit and asking for hugs. I sometimes fall into habit as well and allow him to get really close before I realise it isn’t healthy. 

Charlie has been very supportive since the breakup. I have felt guilty for my lack of feelings for Mark and talking to Charlie about it has helped me work out a lot of my confusion. I even admitted to being confused about our friendship at times, that he made me feel good about myself in a way that Mark had stopped but I knew I was not in love with him and that my feelings only came about as a result of my confused emotional state. Charlie had noticed me change my behaviour towards him but knew not to presume what that behaviour meant. He handled it very well and explained how much our friendship meant to him and that he loves being able to talk to me about everything in his life, knowing I’d never judge him. 

Since this conversation Charlie has changed slightly, he has been watching me with Mark and telling me when I have been falling back into habit with him. Charlie also asks me constantly how things have been with Mark when he’s not around. This is not the confusing part. Charlie has been much more honest about wanting my company and becomes moody if I want time alone. I was noticeably upset one night and didn’t want to talk to anyone but Charlie “just wanted to know what was wrong” and fell into a foul mood and wouldn’t talk to me later that night when I picked myself back out of bed. He has also made comments about how I feel about him. I care about him more than I should for a friend, it’s in a weird place still but with time I won’t need his support anymore but anyway he said that we should still be friends and that it shouldn’t affect our friendship (I wasn’t looking for a relationship, which I made quite clear) he also said that because of this he wasn’t rejecting me… He also joked that in a parallel universe there would been an “us” that got together.

I know that Charlie feels that he can be completely comfortable with me and let himself be vulnerable around me but for the sake of my emotions I need him to stop. He messages me a lot and helps me out when Mark used to. I still want us to be close friends but for the time being I need a lot of space to clear my mind. Mark has made comments about how close Charlie and I are now and I don’t like it. I can see it pain him. 

TL;DR Best friend is being almost too supportive after my breakup and is very comfortable with me despite me placing feelings onto him when I was emotionally confused and stressed. Should I let things run their course and let emotions work themselves out, without affecting our friendship?

25013,Non-Romantic,38k5ht,"So, I have known Jill for 3 years, and I have been good friends with her and her husband, Jack, for a little over a year and a half. In that time, I have gotten to know them both very well. Jack and Jill have been married for 8 years. When I first met them, I was very impressed with how they acted together. They seemed very happy and compatible. 




During the first 6-7 months of my friendship with them, I became close with both of them as a couple and individually. We spent a lot of our time drinking, traveling (they love wine), and doing outdoor activities together. 




About 9 months ago, Jill went on a 2 week road trip with one of her friends. During that time, something happened to Jack, and his feelings for Jill changed. He met up with her and her friend and told Jill that he wanted to sleep with other people. I think that he said that because (a) it was true, and (b) he thought she would break up with him for it. But, while she was heartbroken, ultimately she decided to open their relationship. It was obvious that she was not exactly okay with this arrangement, but it was also unclear whether she was opposed to it because of the stigma associated with open relationships OR because she actually didn’t like the idea of him being with other women. To be clear, she didn’t – and still doesn’t – have any interest in sleeping with other people. We also do not know whether he has actually been with anyone else. It is safe to assume he has, but I also have a hard time imagining him successfully getting many girls to sleep with him in his current state (more on that later).  





About 7 months ago, he started renting a room in a town ~15 miles from our current town. He goes there 1-2 nights per week to sleep, hang out with friends, and presumably hook up with other girls. Jill agreed to this arrangement, but she feels embarrassed when other people find out about it. 





Personally, the whole arrangement is one that I would not want for myself. I think that open/poly relationships are great if those perimeters are set from the start, but I don’t think they fix/solve deep problems. In this case, I think that the problem in the relationship is that Jack is depressed and confused. He is also clearly an alcoholic (more on that later).





Now that you have the backstory, let me explain my part in this. Throughout this whole time I have largely distanced myself from Jack. He has changed SO much in the last year that I hardly recognize him. It has gotten to the point where I can hardly stand being in the same room as him. This is problematic for a few reasons:






* 1)	They live very close to me. Often, Jill will message me and ask to come up to my place, and if it is just her, I am always happy to have her, but if he is with her, I don’t want them to come. When he is at my house, he plays too roughly with my cats, judges my entertainment choices (Twitch), and tries to change shit about me (that’ll be #2)
*2)	He has become SO contrary. He literally will argue about anything and everything. If I complain about something, he will try to change my mind on it.
* 3)	His stories are getting more and more boring. He has no interests anymore (maybe he never did?) outside of making fun of people, drinking, talking about “cool” features other people have (ie- they are from a different country, they are funny, they did something crazy). We spend a lot of time with international students, and he often hangs out with them in bars or at his house. His stories are always about something one of them said or did. I recognize that for some people those stories are interesting, but for me, I can’t stand it when he tells them. I think that’s more because of his behavior and less because of the actual content of his stories.
* 4)	We work together. Need I say more? Haha. I have to see him every day at work, and I can’t stand how little he seems to care about his job these days. He comes late. He leaves early. And the worst part? We are teachers, so he is not just hurting himself, but he is also hurting his students.
* 5)	We are in the same friend group. I have started spending more time with other friends because I can’t stand being near him.
* 6)	He is an alcoholic. He drinks 5-6 nights per week—of those nights, he gets black-out drunk 2-3 nights. My dad died from this disease when I was 18. It is heartbreaking to watch him destroy his life. However, he has yet to admit there is a problem .
Okay. 





So those are the issues… now for my question. 





WHAT THE FUCK DO I DO? Jill is one of my closest friends, and I want to support her in this. She has decided that she wants to try to save her marriage, so I am doing my best to help her. Mostly this support just consists of letting her come over and cry, letting her cuddle my cats, hanging out with her, and letting her know that my couch is always open if she needs a place to crash. At first, I had an easier time suppressing my dislike/annoyance for Jack, but now it has gotten too strong.





 So what do I do? Do I tell her? Do I try to suppress it more? Reddit! HELP! Have any of you experienced this?

However, just two weeks ago my boss was admitted to the hospital in great pain, and has now been diagnosed with liver and colon cancer. It's all happened so fast and I haven't communicated directly with him at all except for an hour long visit when I stopped by his home to discuss work, check in, and pick up mail. His mind wasn't up to the task, however, and so it ended up just being a check-in.


He has been nearly entirely indisposed due to pain, testing, and trauma so I've been keeping the business running in his stead. He is an incredible person, an amazing boss, and I hate that this is happening to him and his family. Luckily he is surrounded by supportive siblings and other family members, and has a wealth of friends. It's awful for all involved and my heart goes out to anyone who is going through this.


That said, I know that despite my efforts, this company doesn't exist without him and can't survive the coming months without his involvement.

On the drive back to the house, my father and I were joking around about how I am almost 30, and I asked my mom how she feels about having such an old daughter.

She said something along the lines of you're lucky to have made it this far - I thought about killing you as a child. You were the most difficult child. I told her that it's not funny to joke about things like that, and she said that she wasn't joking. I told her that it was very hurtful to say something like that, but all she would say is that she doesn't want to kill me anymore. I guess it might seem kind of silly, typing it out now, but it did not seem like she was joking around at all.

Something about Jimmy Carter came on and she said something along the lines of The liberals would kill Jimmy Carter if they could, and they're trying to make it so we just kill off the old. I politely said, I highly doubt that to which it very quickly escalated to Well how would you feel if the government tried to kill your grandmother?


My grandma is dead. We don't talk to my other grandmother, and I haven't seen her since I was 5. My (true) grandma raised me from ages 1-5, and played a huge roll in my life. She was bipolar (which was passed to me), and tried to kill herself multiple times. Then developed lung cancer. I saw her two days before she died. If I could I would have loved if we had something like assisted suicide. She looked like a decaying corpse. She had struggled all her life with mental illness, cancer, and back and knee problems from jumping out of a van (bipolar thing going on here). I remember when she tried to commit suicide. I got to clean out her house and find things like Cancer Surviver pins, and all sorts of other painful things. So yes, if her life could have been more comfortable, maybe I would be okay with whatever the hell my mom was talking about. On the flip side, I know nothing of the issue so I was going to press and fight her on it. 


Anyways, after she said that I just busted out crying. She delivered a low blow and didn't even feel bad about it. She said she didn't mean my grandmother but if she would have thought for two seconds about what she was saying she would have never said it. She did not apologize for what she said, and I don't believe I'm in the wrong. I'm currently not speaking with my mother (which is hard, she's my best friend) mainly for the fact that I believe she owes me an apology. I also don't think I can talk to her at the moment because I firmly believe she is everything wrong with politics now. She's a radical, and won't listen to anything anyone else might feel or believe. She hurt me just to prove a point. Even if that's not what she meant, she needs to clarify that and apologize. Right now I would vocalize that opinion in a very strong way, and I think that could possibly get me kicked out, or at least belittled left and right for my own believes that I rarely share. My younger[20] brother even came into my room last night and asked if I was okay, and even said what my mom was extremely bitchy and uncalled for.

25042,Non-Romantic,2c2o8u,"My sister and I Have been best friends since she was born, we were in a group of friends who always did everything together, and a lot of people mentioned how weird it is for sisters to really be friends now-a-days. 


After 10 years of our current friendship with our other best friends, my sister decided to leave the group because we all didn't agree with who she was dating. 


Now to sum it up, this person is 10 years older than her, jobless, an alcoholic, ex-Jehovahs witness who has been kicked out because he slept with over 50-100 girls, he is in serious debt, homeless (lives on all his friends couches), he treats waitresses like shit, ALL the red flags you hear about. On top of those general things, he has convinced my sister who was a virgin to have sex without a condom, he got piss drunk and called her over and over A FUCKING WHORE, has told her that she doesn't even know what violence is, called her stupid over and over, said shes not trustworthy, and blames her for HIM not being able to change.


All these things happened in December, 2013, when my sister used to tell me things. This is also when she broke off out of our group of friends, and decided to continue dating him although no-one approved. 


Now a little back story, our parents are huge assholes, who have never been there for us, our dad verbally and mentally abuses our mom, so we have had AN amazing example of what an abusive relationship looks like, and what we should keep away from. 


My parents however, have bought my sister a car, and pay for her cellphone bills, both of which she uses to communicate with her boyfriend, despite my parents telling her that she isn't allowed to and they don't approve. They also pay for her Visa because she doesn't have a job, and pretty much never has (she is in her 3rd year university). Two months ago they found out she is still seeing him, and took her phone and car away for A DAY, and then trusted her that she will stop seeing him, so she got everything back. 


Two days ago, I found out she is still seeing him, she told me she was just about to break up with him then she told me hes been amazing to her, however I found out today that they have been fighting, she begs his mom to have him talk to her, she has been taking the Plan B pill too much, he obviously still doesn't have a job, and he is trying to convert her into a Jehovah's witness. 


I feel bad that my parents are paying for her car and visa and cellphone, while she is lying and using that money to feed an abusive person, and continue her abusive relationship, however I have no clue what to do. Im terrified of telling my parents because it will lead to them either physically hurting her, or who knows... maybe her committing suicide (which she has mentioned thinking about before), or my mom getting more abused by my dad and getting blamed (I have called the police on my dad before for threatning to hurt my mom). My dad is also an alcoholic so if I tell them on a day when he is drinking, im seriously scared of what could happen.


I know she is 22 and I cant force her not to date someone, I have no reason to call the police because he isn't doing anything wrong, but I am terrified for my sister and what her life could become, that is if he doesn't end up being violent towards her. I have talked to her SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO much, my mom has talked to her, our ex-best friends have talked to her, she used to admit that she needs to break up with him, and now...shes kicked everyone away from her to be with him, and isn't telling me anything anymore, so I don't have any reason to tell her that hes a horrible person. What do I do????? 


If you think I should take a chill pill and realize my sister is a grown woman, please tell me so. We kind of sound like a crazy family, but we are all well educated, my parents are both engineers, we live in a super nice neighborhood in Canada, I just started work as an ENgineer in Training, and my sister is a student in Finance. 


I am terrified for her. I cannot stop shaking in my chair at work, I haven't been able to focus on my new job. I love her sooooooo much, I haven't been able to stop myself from crying every day, but shes just running into the arms of an abusive person. All she keeps saying is that SHE NEEDS TO HELP HIM CHANGE, HE JUST NEEDS HELP CHANGING, SHE JUST WANTS TO BE THERE FOR HIM SO HE CAN CHANGE. sounds like effing BS excuse. And on top of that, shes told me that maybe SHE is the abusive one, not him (imo, shes willing to take the blame just so he doesn't seem so bad so she can continue seeing him).

She will only seriously pay attention to the question if we piss her off to the point where she will ask us to repeat the question and answer. This makes it really difficult to get the answer out of her, and I can't do much if I don't get her confirmation (ex. Could I use this pot to cook...).

The second problem is that she always tries to run from argument. Every time I try to consult her to start paying attention she'll just ask me to bug off and play games or draw.

25054,Non-Romantic,2dxri5,"This might get kinda complicated but I'll try to make it as short and simple as possible.

Me and three friends (all 21 now) have been a group since freshman year of high school. 7 years later the four of us are still friends and although we went to different colleges we all make an effort to see each other as frequently as possible during our school breaks when we're all in our hometown.

However, one of our friends (I'll call her Ali) has been slacking on that effort for quite a while now. While we all live in the US, her family's cultural background means that she has a huge family that are all very close. She's always been the one who was first to cancel/postpone plans and usually it's because she has some family thing that just came up - and that's part of the annoyance, that it's usually pretty sudden with very little notice.

The other three of us (I'll call one of them Beth and one Cathy) have been discussing this issue all this summer. We're constantly complaining about how annoyed we are and we've discussed telling Ali off multiple times, but then she'll actually hang out with us and we won't say anything because we don't want to drive her away even more.

Here's a few specific examples:

1) Beth experienced the death of a close family member around a holiday. This holiday also happened to be Ali's 21st birthday while the rest of us were still 20. Ali insisted on going out to bars with Darla (her friend who isn't friends with the rest of us) instead of hanging out at Beth's house to keep her company during a time that she needed us. The kicker - Beth was going out of the country the day after that holiday and Ali hadn't seen her since the memorial for Beth's family member (like two weeks earlier).

2) My 21st birthday was about 2 months after we all got back from college. We went to dinner the first weekend we were all home and I told them I was going to rent a hotel room in the town I went to college so I could show them around and we could go to the bars together. She ended up canceling only days before we were supposed to leave (after the hotel had been booked for over a month) because she couldn't get off work. She claimed that her manager *only* scheduled her on the days she asked off, and says she told him two weeks beforehand but I'm not sure I believe either of those things.

3) Most recently, we made plans to go to dinner and see a movie. She texts us the day of and says she has to go to dinner with a family member since this was the last time she could see them before she left for college. She said she could still go to the movie, but she was bringing Darla because Ali doesn't have a license yet and she needed a ride. She shows up to the movie after the trailers are over and said she couldn't come back to my house after because she had to go home with Darla (Ali and I live in the same neighborhood and it takes 2 minutes for me to drive her home). We got to talk to her for maybe 10 minutes in the lobby while Darla awkwardly stood 3 feet away on her phone. Cathy told me later that Ali didn't even hug her goodbye when she left. Ali then asks my work schedule and says that we can hang out tonight (Monday). When I texted our group text about it, Beth said she couldn't anymore and Ali didn't respond. I texted her directly and she said she didn't think we were doing anything since Beth couldn't. I asked why we couldn't hang out just the two of us and told her today was the only day I could do it because of my work schedule and plans to go out of state this weekend - by the time I get back from that Ali will be back at college. She never responded.

Basically, she constantly flakes on our plans, but usually has what appears to be a legitimate excuse. Often she simply won't respond, even tho whenever we hang out she's constantly on her phone and even answers calls while we're all driving somewhere and were in the middle of talking.

We did stop inviting her to events as much, and then she would get mad when she found out about them.

We don't want to lose a friend but it's getting absolutely ridiculous at this point. What would you do in this situation? Cut contact? Tell her off/explain the problem? Stop inviting her but still talk and hang out if she invited us (although she also cancels on plans she initiates)?

25070,Non-Romantic,2riteh,"Been friends with a core group of 6 people for 20+ years and 3 of us hang out on a regular basis, because we live near each other. A few years ago, one of those friends (Mike) moved about an hour away to a place where he doesn't know anybody and doesn't really go out. He used his new dead time to get into TV shows. Like, REALLY into TV shows. As in he probably watches at least 25-30 hours of TV a week.



Normally, this wouldn't be a terrible thing. I understand we all have our passions or things that we really like and get into. The problem is every time we see him, he just wants to watch TV with everyone. Or more accurately, he wants to spend 4-5 hours making everyone watch what he has been into lately, regardless of how much you like it. I'm all for a mini-marathon every so often, but usually only do it with people who I know like the show and only for like 2-3 hours before we do something else. 



If Mike isn't there when the hanging out/party starts, everyone has a great time. As soon as he shows up, he waits for us to finish whatever we are doing (board game, conversation, video games, etc.) and the whole time sorts through what TV he will show us this time (he never goes anywhere without some iPad or Apple TV). Then, he'll put the TV on and announce the next 4 hour block of programming. Usually about an hour in, everybody is on their phones and not even paying attention. You think that would be enough to take the hint, but it isn't. The few times somebody does say something, he gets grumpy/pouty about it. 



I understand he just want to share his passion and interest with us, because he has no one else to do it with. However, the level of interest for everyone else quickly wans after an episode or two. It's getting to the point where if you want to do something, you have to invite him two hours later or just not invite him altogether.

We continued talking over text and talking about our favorite shows. At one point I even recommended a show to her and she actually watched it. It really impressed me because nobody else I ever knew took my opinion on that seriously. Over the months we talked about all sorts of things, and some personal things relating about our everyday lives. I'm not a very social person in real life so I prefer talking to friends online. I didn't have any at school so eventually she became the only person I could relate to about that kind of stuff.

Everything was going fine until one random day in May she stopped replying. It wasn't that she saw my message and decided not to reply, it still says it's unread up till now. It's been about a month and I still haven't heard back, I know people have busy lives and can't respond right away but a month seems too long. When we used to speak I never sent a message until she responded to my first one, so it wasn't me ever going plz reply. I only sent one follow up message last week along the lines of asking if everything is going okay and that along with my reply to her last message hasn't been read yet.

A few days ago I was curious, so I decided to search her name on Facebook and see if she was on there. I found her Facebook account and her Instagram, and she's been regularly updating them. At that time I felt really depressed and sad assuming I'm being ignored. Now I've gotten over it and I'm wondering if I should contact her on Facebook. I'm guessing that if she's constantly updating her social media and not replying to me it means she's not interested in talking anymore. I just want to know if it would be the right thing for me to message her on Facebook or if that would be too creepy since she never told me about it. 

Now that I've moved on, all I want to do is thank her for talking to me for all that time and say goodbye because I really treasured the conversations we had together. If I should send a message what should I say? Should I even send one? I feel like it would haunt me forever if I don't because our conversation ended abruptly and I never got to say goodbye.

Also I'd like to mention a few things about the nature of our conversations. Even though we're of the opposite sexes neither of us brought up the topic of any relationship, any romance, or anything sexual in any way. I thought of her as a friend only, and I think she thought the same. The conversations weren't one sided either, she started the conversation several times as well. She never responded with 'k' or any conversation enders, and whenever she did read my message and not reply, or reply late she would always apologize. When she added me on the app(which is sort of obscure), it was clear she just made the account right away and I seemed to be the only person she was talking to on it.

My current roommate and I made a deal for our housing next year, that we were going to get a suite with a kitchen, bathroom, and living space. We had a few other options, and our last resort was living in the same room we are in now.


She came back from a weekend and tells me that she can no longer afford the suite (everything other than the traditional room we live in costs extra) and that she just wants to stay where we are. I told her okay, but she knew I wasn't happy about it, and we didn't really formally make a decision.


The more I've thought about it, the more I really want my own room next year since she won't pay for a suite. While it it's only her junior year, it's my senior year, my last year, and I want some more independence since I'll be on my own in another year. A single would give me my own space, let me bring my piano keyboard, have friends stay over, etc.


I brought this up with my roommate and she immediately got upset at the thought of me having a single and leaving her so that she'd have to find a roommate.

So, I have two neices, C, who is 4, and V, who is 9. Their mother is my half sister. She and her two daughters live with my grandmother about a block away from me. My Uncle, who is in his 50s, lives with them also. 

My older sister is a single mother. She is pretty immature, if I'm to be honest. She cares more about getting her nails done than spending time with her girls. She does look after them, since she lives on the large child support from C's dad (we aren't really sure who is V's father), but she does often leave the girls home alone with  My uncle (who I'll just call CU for creepy uncle from now), while she goes on dates or spends nights out of town with boyfriends. 


So, when my step sisters and stepbrother were growing up, they lived with CU and my grandma because they didn't  like my dad, whom my mom married when they were young. My mom allowed them to live there.

My stepbrother got into drugs, started running away frequently, and moved out at the age of 16 with friends. I haven't talked to him since, and he has only contacted my mom once or twice on fb, although we all miss him.

Last year, he came forward to my mom with the story that he had been sexually abused by CU for years. People doubted him because of his drug use. Everyone just kinda shrugged their shoulders and ignored it.

That is when my little sister M told my mother and I that she had also been abused by CU. She is a very honest girl, and I do not believe for a second she would lie about this. She was his favorite  when she was little, and we would often sleep over at grandma's house. I feel like such a fucking fool, playing in the backyard or something while my little sister was potentially being abused and I didn't help her. I don't know any of the details or what really happened to her. She didn't want to tell me and I really don't want to know. Part of me holds on to the hope that maybe this is all a big misunderstanding,  like maybe she misunderstood  what was happening? I hope, but deep down I doubt it.

So now I'm worried about my neices. One of them sleeps in the living room, and so does CU. I lie awake at night wondering what might be hppening, but the thing is, I have zero proof, zero reason to think anything is going on.

I've talked to my mom a few times about wanted to report him. She is 100% against it. She says my sister will lose her kids, or her free babysitting from CU, or he will find out we were the ones who reported him and not let me see my grandma, who is senile and doesn't have much time left. Everyone will know it was me if I report it without permission. It would cause a huge blowup in my family and everyone would be furious with me.

I called an anonymous  support line and told them the same story, and they told me that if I make a report, someone will go to the home and interview  the children. I want them to have a chance to tell someone if something actually  is by chance going on. 

I also want justice. I want him to pay for what he did to my brother, who has lost everything, and to my sister, who can't have any relationships because of this.

Backstory: 
My stepmom has two daughters from a previous marriage. Her ex (also 30's) is basically a huge douchenozzle. He lives an hour away and only occasionally shows up for his weekends with his girls. And when he does show up, he mainly just buys them things. 

Recently, stepmom was re-evaluating the child support her ex pays (she lives quite frugally, as does my father [51]) and she found out he's been underpaying for years. She got in contact, showed him the re-evaluation and asked him to pay more. They're not on great terms but she's a decent person so I imagine she asked him politely. He responded by slamming her with custody papers. 

When she told her daughters, they said they wanted to go with their dad because he buys them things. That wasn't the reason they listed but it was painfully obvious. From my perspective, she's a great mom. She enforces structure and rules but also has fun with them. I'm really disappointed in them for being so materialistic, even for teenage girls. And I was once a teenage girl. Still am, technically. 

The custody laws in my state are shit and there's a slim chance the ex will actually get custody, but it's more about making her life more difficult, which he has clearly succeeded in doing. If she's going to fight it, she'll need to pay the lawyer fees. She and my dad both make a decent amount of money but have a lot of debt they've been working really hard to pay off. They're also adamant about financially helping me through college (I'm working on getting my teaching license). My dad is going to be stuck paying the fees and this is going to put us, as a family, dangerously in the hole. 

I'm currently not living at home and she's technically not my stepmom. She and my dad were going to get married but they had to take her ring back to start paying the retainer fee of $5000. I don't know her daughters very well so I don't know the entire dynamic of the situation. I know my dad is pretty pissed at them for how they're treating their mother but he hasn't fully expressed that to them. 

So, main issue....is there any way to make it easier to pay? Are there any resources we're entitled to or eligible for?

Way back when three friends and I, for this story they will be John and Jim, used to hang out, game, drink and just enjoy each others company 3 times a week. We would do anything game related including but not limited to board games, card games, wii games, old school n64 games, pc games like starcraft, first person shooters, mmos and many more. You name it and we would likely play it, it was always something new each week and we always had fun.

Now John and Jim both were going out of town for two weeks for a camping trip and I wasn't able to get off work for it so I got to stay behind. By the second week I was getting pretty bored so I invited a coworker, we shall call him Bob, who said he loved gaming and we gamed and drank like I would with Jim and John.

John and Jim come back and are just as excited as I am at adding a fourth to our group! We could fill out a squad or have four to play scrabble! It would completely change the way we played games and open up other games we never really could play before! We were very excited and we now agree that this probably clouded our judgement. 

We invited Bob to start joining us but he could only join us once a week which was fine. What we discovered was that Bob was not quite into gaming the same way we were. He didn't like any board, card or console games at all and would only do PC gaming. This was fine because we had a TON of PC games we loved to play. Then as the weeks went on we discovered he got frustrated easily and only really like to play one MAYBE two of the PC games available to us at the time. 

Now as I said before our excitement coupled with the fact that this was only one night out of our three nights a week clouded the issue and I should have spotted it like the sun on a clear day but didn't so one night a week we would play the same games until one came out that he was willing to play. None of us minded because we were able to play those games with full squads.

Fast forward 1 year and John has been offered an amazing job in Florida which is close to an entire country away from us. He accepts because he can't turn down such an amazing possibility. Other things have been changing as well. Jim and I both found girlfriends and agreed that since John was no longer going to be joining us for gaming that we would only game twice a week now. 

I still don't really notice the impact Bob is having but due to only gaming twice a week I do begin to notice how annoying he can be and how much he is limiting us is starting to rub. At this point though we have become friends and I decide to let it go.

Fast forward 4 years and I have gotten married, bought a house and am having a baby. For anyone who has ever gotten married and had a baby you know it changed your entire life and gaming goes down to one day a week at best.

Now I and Jim are really really noticing how much Bob is bringing us down since we only game on the night we gamed with him now as it worked best with all of our schedules. Bob has only gotten worse not better and in the middle of Bob approved games if he has died one too many time he will rage quit in the middle of it. We have tried speaking to him about it, gently touching the issue and each time he gets whiff of what we are talking about he gets pissed and has even raised his voice in agitation. 

A year of this and I am having serious anxiety problems. I have a long history of anxiety issue that I am on medication for. Also gaming has always relieved my anxiety. Now the closer the game night gets the worse my anxiety gets. I am not getting the release I need and the idea of dealing with Bob is getting to me. 

Jim is also having issues with this and wants a resolution but he is such a passive person that it is hard for him to speak up especially if he is going to get yelled at for it. 

Bob has been with us for 6 years now, we have helped each other through hard things and have become friends through this but his attitude is really hurting me and I need to end it. 

I guess what I'm asking for is what I can do to handle it the best? I was thinking about leaving his stuff (monitor, gaming keypad, mouse) at his work and then calling him to let him know we don't want him coming to game night anymore.  I still work with him but not in the same part of the building and I don't ever have to see him if I don't want to. 

What should I do?

Hi guys!

I have had a very long and storied fully platonic relationship with a girl (let's call her Siri) for 10 years now and I think it's time it ends.

I'd be lying if I didn't consider taking a romantic turn with this girl several times over the years, but I believe I don't believe it would be healthy for either of us to do that. She's still very immature and I honestly don't think I should be with someone as experienced as her.

We met at university and became good friends quickly bonding over shared interests (movies, music, comics, etc.)

I have never been in a romantic relationship in my life for a variety of reasons (religious/cultural/anti-social tendencies) but I believe I have matured enough to start one. Just not with her.

I believe maintaining a friendship with her would be detrimental to any relationship I hope to have with any other girl.

Siri has had 6 boyfriends since I first met her and currently lives with one of them.

Siri, however, texts me everyday, likes or comments on any postings I make on social media and just generally has been a presence in my life in a very big way. Sometimes she sends me text messages that I consider extremely inappropriate considering she has a boyfriend. Things like 'I miss you' and the occasional 'I love you'.

I am always too uncomfortable to ask for further explanation on the nature of these texts but I know she would explain them away as inconsequential.

There have been numerous occasions where I find myself doing things I feel her boyfriend should be doing (consoling her, calming her down, window shopping, taking her to doctors appointments, etc.). I have read enough online about friend zones and male entitlement so I'll say this right now; I realize this is very 'beta' behaviour. And NO I don't think by doing these things I am in any way entitled to her body. At this point, I wouldn't want it anyway.

I'm pretty sure our friendship would make any significant other extremely uncomfortable so I think it's time to end it.

What do you guys think? Am I wrong?

I could go on for days with details but I'd rather let you guys ask any questions you might think are relevant to avoid rambling.

Also, I will be as open and honest as I can possibly be about everything.

25123,Non-Romantic,2e3glr,"My ex broke up with me about almost a month ago, very suddenly and unexpected from my side. We have had a relationship for more than 2,5 years. We didn't break up with a fight, but I was very heartbroken about it, since I thought we had a future ahead of us.

Since a little over a week I said 'no contact, unless something important happens, untill the worst sadness is over, because he kept talking to me on facebook about his day but this only reminded me of how nice it was to have him as my boyfriend.

It was him who said he hoped we really could be friends, mostly because he had come to see me more as his best friend than his girlfriend the last year. We have a lot in common and enjoy doing the same things, so he hopes we can still keep gaming together and stuff like that.

Yet, after 2,5 years of sharing happy and sad moments, I feel like he ignores me feelings completely. It has been a very tough month on me.

It happened very sudden. Though my grandmother wasn't in the best of health (she had diabetes), we loved her and she was very sweet and kind untill the end.

I thought I would tell my ex this, since the break-up was a pretty short period ago. He said 'my condolences', but only on FB chat and hasn't send a card or contacted my parents in any way. To me, this is unrespectful towards my parents and actually hurts me. 

He has been visiting my house for almost 3 years, we celebrated Christmas with my family and his, my parents gave him presents, he got invited on trips and my family always acted kind towards him. When his grandfather died, my family send a card and I attended the funeral, but that was when we had a relationship.

I asked her who was there with her, and she replies, Its just me and brother.

TL;DR – My dad got extremely drunk. Began insulting my oldest brother about our deceased mother and the fact that his wife recently cheated on and divorced him. Not sure what to do about this situation.


My (23/M) brother (26/M) is getting married in a few weeks. Myself, my dad (46/M) and oldest brother (27/M) decided to take my brother out for some drinks and hang out with him. We all live in different cities across the state, which can make visiting each other difficult. This was supposed to be a fun night. Drinking, talking, joking and so on, but it ended rather badly.


Note: My “dad” is actually my adoptive father. I do not know my real father. My mother and “dad” split up in the late 80’s, early 90’s, and were seeing other people for a few years (i.e. my biological father) until reconnecting in 1991. Not sure why this relevant, but I feel it is. I’ve always been drastically different personality wise from my “dad” and his side of the family. It makes me question the nature vs. nurture argument sometimes.


A few hours into the night, my soon to married brother was quite inebriated. Nothing too bad, he was just ready to check out. We walked him to a taxi and one of his friends accompanied him back to the hotel. He does not remember or know of the following events yet. After we had taken care of my brother, my older brother and dad got into a slight argument. This isn’t uncommon. We had a rough child hood after my parents divorced. Dad hated my mother (who was actually a beautiful person, he just didn’t like that he couldn’t control her) and would attempt to manipulate us kids into siding with him on everything. I was around 8 when the divorce happened. My dad tricked me into signing a legal document stating I wanted to live him by telling me we will “practice my signature”. I’d never signed anything at that point and was pretty excited. 8 year old me didn’t bother to read the document. I never wanted to live with him as he was quite emotionally abusive. He would yell and curse at us about small infractions constantly. You’d think we burned the house down, but it would only be something small like not wanting to go to bed. He would attempt to make us resent our mother so we would not want to visit her. It never worked, and my siblings and I would long for those weekends when we could visit mom. In 2007, mom had some medical complications and passed away after 8 months in coma. It was devastating to us, but I’ve always had the inkling feeling my dad was happy she passed away. 


Sorry for the tangent, I just wanted to provide a little backstory. Back to the story. So they are arguing, although it’s mostly my dad getting in my brothers face about past events. Laughing at him for his wife leaving him and telling him my mother was a bitch while my brother tried to play it off as my dad being much too drunk. Now, at this point, a friend of mine who had accompanied us was angry at something my father said earlier (surprise) and was storming off. This is in a city none of us live in, so I did not want to let him be by himself since I was sober and he was not. What happens next I did not see personally, but I heard testimony from others in our group who were there and my brother (the victim) that matched up. My dad was apparently angry my brother was not fighting back, and punched him. My brother was caught by surprise and fell. As he was on the ground, my dad started kicking him. My brother regained his composure, and knocked my dad down. He then proceeded to punch my dad repeatedly in the face. Someone stopped my brother and they walked off, away from my dad. 


At this point, I’m back at our hotel with our wandering friend and my brother and some of his friends are with him. Dad is nowhere to be seen. My brother has a black eye and scrapes along his arm. I ask what happened and they tell me what I just outlined above. I’m taken aback. I always knew our dad was kind of an asshole, but never would I have thought he would physically assault one of us. He (my dad) recently got married to a wonderful woman. She is fantastic in every way. Ever since my dad has been with her, she’s brought out a great side in him (or so I thought). He is always so happy and nice and they support each other really well. We actually liked visiting him for once. This is the first time in 2 years that my dad has consumed alcohol, which I think must have brought up some issues eating at him that he conveyed in the worst manner possible. 


We never see my dad again that night. He apparently caught a taxi somewhere, called my step-mom and had her pick him up at 4 AM and take him home. She texted us and said he was ok, but obviously emotionally and physically wounded. The following morning, we were having breakfast (my brothers and friends who stayed after seeing it all) and discussing what to do. My oldest brother who was assaulted suggested we not mention it to my soon to married brother, who was still passed out from the night before, because as far as he’s concerned last night was an alcohol fueled night of fun and that we would tell him later. It was his last night with his brothers as an un-married man. We didn’t want to ruin it until we could sit him down and explain. We played off my brothers injuries as him falling. Anyways, so we are discussing what to do. My oldest brother is pretty much set on cutting contact with my father. They’ve had problems for damn near 15 years and there is constant tension between them. What my dad said to him the night before was inexcusable and completely uncalled for. It was rude and dangerous to say things to man that depressed (my brother is depressed because the love of his life cheated on him and left him). I had the same feeling. I feel I can no longer subject myself to such a toxic person. He is nice now, thanks to my lovely step mom, but if he has these feelings about us and my mother (who was seriously the most amazing woman I’ve ever known) and will attempt to continue to insult and emotionally abuse us into adulthood, he’s god damn wrong about that. I want to cut contact until he seeks therapy. 


My question is, what do you think will be the best course of action? I don’t want to talk to the man. He’s potentially dangerous, emotionally and physically, and seems to be itching for confrontation to make us feel like shit. I don’t need the dude, and neither do my brothers. We all have high paying stable jobs. Is my dad upset that we are no longer vulnerable and dependent? Is he just an asshole? I want to compose a letter telling him of his toxic ways and that I will not continue contact with him until he receives therapy. Is this a good idea?


I feel I’ve painted a horrible picture of him, and although it is warranted at the moment he is actually a really nice guy every day he doesn’t drink (which is extremely, extremely rare). I want to give him the benefit of the doubt and see what counseling can do for him, but until then I feel he needs to learn humility and embarrassment to correct his ways. I want to cut contact until he does this.


Sorry if this is jumbled and confusing, it was a bad night and I have a lot of thoughts going on in my head that are hard to summarize.

25192,Non-Romantic,2kuxg8,"Yes, I know the age difference is significant.  It didn't stop us from getting together, being together, and (most importantly) loving each other.

I met my boyfriend Jack when I went to a high school ball game Jack was playing in with my sister, she was dating Jack's older brother (out of school) so we hung out with them very late that night.

He just seemed incredible to me, he seemed like he had all of his shit together, he was funny, and he was very attractive.  Since I was infatuated I completely pushed the age difference to the back of my mind.

After that night he texted me asking me out for dinner, and we've been together since then.  The relationship has been great, we're both into the same stuff, although he's a little bit geekier (he's the reason I know Reddit exists).  There's also (surprisingly) never been push back about us being together with his family or mine.  They really like me.

The problems are with a few of my friends, Catherine, Ian.  They're in my core group (along with 4 other people) and they've constantly given me shit about being with my boyfriend.

Catherine constantly refers to him as my baby that you fuck. (I don't have a problem with the crassness of the joke, she's always been like that).  I would be fine with a little bit of teasing since the age difference is a little weird and I do admittedly take care of him (make sure he studies and drop him off at his university).  But it's excessive, and when I tried to talk about it she just laughed it off.  

Ian's been completely hostile about it.  He keeps telling me it's not going to work and has actively said things in from of me and my boyfriend.  I'm fairly sure it's because he's weirdly jealous or something.  I turned him down in high school, he seemed fine about it, and we stayed friends (although I was somewhat distant with him compared to everyone else in our little group.  I don't think he ever picked up on it).  My boyfriend thinks he has a crush on me, and I do to.  Not really sure what to about him either.

What do I do here?  How do I talk to them about this?  Jack and I are serious, obviously he's young and still changing but it's been great with him, and I really love him.

Tldr- One friend is making fun of my younger boyfriend, and the other is downright hostile (I think he has a crush on me).  What do I do?

While he was growing up, he was this really quiet, sweet boy.  I thought he would have trouble making friends, but he didn't.  He was really athletic, played every sport, so he fit right in.  He grew up to be a really handsome young man.

When he was 16, he started bringing girls around.  It freaked me out because that's how old I was when I had him, so I sat him down and had the protection talk.  I knows he's been sexually active since, I always pretended not to notice the loud music and him sneaking girls in and out of his room in our apartments.

He went to college about 2 hours away from home.  He's currently renting a house with two girls who I hadn't met.

I recently got a job offer in the city, and am going to move in with a friend who lives there.  I'm not sure on the specifics, but she had to prepare, so my son invited me to stay with him at his house for a few days.  I told him to make sure his roommates were fine with it, and he said they were.

I told him that I would be there around 7 yesterday, and he said that no one was would be home until 9, so he would put a key underneath the flower pot so I could let myself in and put my stuff in his room.

I got there earlier, around 5.  I let myself in to do just that since there weren't any cars and knocking did no good.  I saw them there in his room.  They noticed the door open, I said I was sorry and I left as fast as I could.

I ignored my son's texts and calls, just sent him something about staying in a hotel, where I am currently and am going to stay until I can move in with my friend.

25228,Non-Romantic,1pw2zr,"Back story on my boyfriend's family: 2 parents (pretty good marriage from what I see), 3 kids and he's the youngest and only boy.  His dad, 'Joe' came from England when he was a young adult for college. Joe's dad died of lung cancer when Joe was 13.  His mom died before my BF was born.

Both sisters are incredibly successful and have done really really well form themselves.  One has a JD and the other has an MBA, both from top universities.  Both were also Valedictorian of their graduating class in HS.

My bf was a bit of a troublemaker (think usual skater kid who would get into shenanigans with friends) but still pretty smart.  He did well in college - but he is KILLING it at work.  He's only been working full time for 3 years and he's moved up to a senior position and making close to six figures.  

Anyway, we have had a pretty good relationship.  I am very emotionally driven and usually express to him any problems, concerns, self-confidence issues I have and he takes it all in stride.  I was diagnosed as a pretty severe case of ADHD right before we started dating, and he's been trying his best to understand the crazy problems that can come with it.  Though he questions a lot why my family is so honest with things (sister has anxiety, brother struggles with some stuff, my mom has a sister who's bipolar/schizophrenic) and I tell him it's because it really helps us deal with our problems head on.

He has basically never had any 'major' issue with his family.

About Time is a WONDERFUL little happy movie that I loved.  It shows a guy with very  happy relationships with his gf/wife and his family.  The dad/son relationship is really highlighted and pretty wonderful.  It gets a little emotional.

After seeing the movie we were feeling very sweet with each other, and I commented how with the movie dad being British, it reminded me a bit of his dad.  Two blocks of driving later, he has to pull over because there are tears in his eyes.  He breaks down crying for the third time EVER in our relationship and asks me if I thought his dad was proud of him.

Of course I am holding back tears as I just hold him and tell him that of COURSE his dad loves him and is proud of him.  The thing is, he is very much a 'mother's son' and his dad definitely holds this position that makes him more distant when it comes to showing any emotional support toward his kids. I figured before that is just how dad is, and it seemed self-explanatory to me with his dad's history. I was telling my BF that he can go ahead and hug his dad and tell him that he loves him if he wants. In my mind, if he wants to better the relationship, the first step is communicating it and to start it yourself. It's very difficult to change the other person without some personal responsibility on your own end.

My dad is very caring and loving and I have NEVER felt like my parents weren't proud of me. As a girl, I have always gotten hugs and love from my dad, and I realized that the son/father relationship is SOO different. My dad has to really work on it with my brother in a way that is different than how he grew up, to support my brother emotionally.

Now, my boyfriend is pretty emotionally closed off - it's something that I've been working on with him, but it's really hard. I want to be able to bring it up again without him freaking out or brushing it aside. From what I see, his family doesn't like to talk about what is 'wrong' and brush it under the rug. It's the absolute opposite how I grew up.

I want to reassure him about his dad, and I want his dad to be able to reassure him as well. I love this guy, and I see a future and a family with him. This obviously a long-term issue, but one that I want to address in a way that will ALSO help him be the father he wants to be.

TL;DR: My unemotional boyfriend became emotional after watching After Time. He is worried he isn't a good son, and he isn't happy with the relationship he has with his dad (being British and growing up w/o a father has made him more distant).

25247,Non-Romantic,30zo4n,"Apologies for the ramblyness of this post


**Context:**

Two years ago I moved schools. Tiffany was one of the first people to speak to me, she seemed cool and nice so of course i wanted to be friends with her.

Long story short she is neither cool nor nice. At first I thought she was a lone wolf and didn't need/want a large friendship group. More like no one likes her and she has been ostracised by the rest of the school year for being a terrible person.

As the school year went on I realized how shitty she was and no longer wanted to be friends with her and started to push her away. I've been trying to get rid of her give her the message that we are no longer friends, by being cold and distant. This did not work. All this achieved was the realisation that I am a gigantic idiot, and that this girl is *determined* to be my friend.

So I gave up, whatever school will finish soon, we're going to study in different countries, what will happen will happen. Part of growing up is accepting that you have to deal with people who you dont like. At this point she was just extremely annoying, I can handle this.


**Fast forward a year:**

Tiffany has wormed her way into my friendship group dragging her toxic friends with her. Annoying but whatever. No one in the group has the balls to tell them to fuck off and we don't want to come off as bitchy or bullys. They constantly start drama, its exhausting and no one wants them there.

Recently Tiffany started inviting herself along to events. She even invited herself to a birthday party she didn't get an invite for. Once someone told her she wasn't invited to something, she went beetroot red and looked like she was going to cry, we thought she's got the message. 1 week later she pretended like that exchange never happened, and turned up anyway. rinse and repeat.


How the heck do I stop her from thinking she's invited?

25252,Non-Romantic,39x55e,"I've been friends with a woman for about 7 years. We had a ton of acquaintances in common, but I don't see many of them often. I'm friends with her husband and my husband is friends with both of them. She has struggled with anxiety and is the type of person who avoids things that are giving her anxiety. I understand that. I've had anxiety problems on and off my whole life so it's not like I'm just expecting her to get over it. 

But talking on the phone stresses her out. Texting stresses her out. I've called, texted, or Facebook messaged her about hanging out or doing something  every week for the past 6 months, at least.  I got one response. She doesn't check her messages or email. I joked  one day that I'd send her a letter through the mail and she joked back that she wouldn't answer it. The only way to contact her is to talk through her husband. He and her  other friends enable her so much. She sees a few ppl, but they all go through him to set things up. For some reason it really bothers me to do that, and I'm not willing to do it. 

I've tried so many ways to make it low pressure on her, like texting her the day before and saying I'm going to call you tomorrow afternoon, I'd  just love to catch up. Never any response. 

You would think from this that she just doesn't want to be friends. But 2 years ago it was this bad and I confronted her about it (she and her husband play d&amp;d with my husband and me, she sometimes comes to games,) and she was really upset ifelt that way. She was used to her friends saying they don't mind. For a few months it was great, like it used to be. I felt kind of bad that she answered my calls even when she was busy, but it's probably all our nothing with her. She has never set up something for us to do. 

Anyway, I'm fucking over it. I have more friends and less time now. She won't give me the time of day, and honestly I want to be friends with functional human beings. 

Is it super shitty to stop wanting to be friends with someone because of their mental health issues that they've stopped trying to get better from? Her husband keeps trying to set up a time for all of us to get together and it's a pain to find a time that works with them and also our baby.

25255,Non-Romantic,3bydgi,"  My brother and his GF were dating for about 3 years. They've been having a pretty rocky relationship for the past 1.5 years including several dramatic breakups. About a month and a half ago his GF who we'll call Carolyn, broke up with him. Essentially the reason being that she's fet up and done with the dramatics.

  When they broke up I received a phone call from Carolyn at about 3am. She's crying and said she was scared because she broke up with him and he's threatening suicide. This of course worries me. After I get off the phone with her I try to go back to sleep but of course I'm tossing and turning worrying about it. She's with him so I know nothing will actually happen that night but I still worry for him.

  Fast forward to the next day. I'm at work and texting the both of them trying to help them both out and figure out the story. Carolyn says it's definitely the right choice to break up and she doesn't regret it at all, but she's still concerned for him. I actually, completely agree with all her reasons for breaking up. He is waaaay too controlling and gets jealous over every little thing. She's a waitress and he gets angry because she has to talk to young men at her job. He hates when he hears that she goes to the bars because he just can't trust that she'll turn down guys that hit on her. It's so bad that on her 18th birthday (legal drinking age is 18 here) he refused to take her out to the bar and I took her instead. 

  While I say this, Carolyn isn't perfect either. She definitely has her jealousy as well. She chooses to hang out with her friends more often than to hang out with him. She also gets very defensive when my brother tries to talk about their issues. At the very end of the day, I just see it as they are not compatible and should just end it. 

  Carolyn and I have become quite close over the past 3 years. We hang out a lot without my brother and get along really great since we have mutual friends and we're close in age. She even hung out with me for my birthday and my brother wasn't there. I have decided to continue our friendship even post break up. I was upfront about it to my brother, told him I would obviously not flaunt it and bring her over to our house and what not. He agreed that would be okay.

  So now it's been a few weeks and he knew Carolyn and I were planning to hang out soon. We finally did the other night and we had a great time! I did not tell him the exact day I would be seeing her as I didn't want to be bombarded with questions of what she's been saying and how she's been doing. I told him from the beginning that I refuse to be the messenger between them and I'm not getting involved.

  So come today, he's texting me asking if I was with Carolyn last night. I didn't lie, I told him yes. Of course, just as I was expecting, he starts asking questions like Is she seeing someone? Does she want to get back together? etc. I have told him a million times that I don't think she's interested in getting back together and that he should start moving on because at this point it's not healthy. He REFUSES to hear this. He tells me I'm being a shitty sister for not giving him info about her life and that I'm not telling him that there's hope that they'll get back together and everything will be all sunshine and rainbows again. (Carolyn is seeing someone new, but I have not told him this and feel it is definitely not my place to tell. Also, I really doubt it's going to help him get over her any faster). He says that he wants nothing to do with me and that I'm no longer his sister. I told him not to guilt trip me and that this isn't my issue. I kindly told him that I am done talking to him for the night and said goodnight. He has been spam texting me ever since saying that I'm a bitch and that he hates me.

  Basically what I'm wondering is, am I in the wrong for not telling him about her seeing someone new? How can I stop him from guilt tripping me and putting me in the middle of this issue that I'm really no longer interested in hearing about anymore. I'm happy to give advice but he refuses to hear it.

I've caused some confusion, the 'vest underneath' bit means she'd be wearing it usually. My problem is she wasn't wearing it then when I feel like she should have had time to. That led to me seeing her body. Sorry montaro not.

I'm looking for advice on how I can frame a conversation with her without seeming like I'm attacking her or accusing her of being a bad mom.

Let me go back a little bit to when I was a kid. I was awkward, no doubt about it. Constantly saying the wrong things and offending others and embarrassing myself, then finally refusing to say much at all for fear of offending someone/being laughed at. My mom was often critical of my awkwardness. She would call me out on the inappropriate things that I would say, making me feel even more awkward or even downright stupid (though I don't blame her for this; as a mom, I'd want to help my child be normal too). She would also try to get me to dress in clothes that were more fashionable than I was comfortable with (again, she was just trying to break me out of my comfort zone, but it made me feel like she didn't accept me for who I was at the time), and criticizing the way I walked (slouched, head down, trying to hide in the crowd). Looking back, I think this might be part of the reason she doesn't like me much. 

Fast forward to today. I am much more adjusted. I have learned how to socialize much easier, completely overcoming my social anxiety, and I no longer feel like I am constantly in danger of embarrassing myself or someone else with my words. However, I think my mom still sees me as that awkward little girl who she is embarrassed of and needs to protect. If I do or say anything she remotely doesn't agree with, I get the look, the one that always told me it's time to shut up now. I feel like even though I am finally confident in who I am and how I socialize, my mom isn't.

Another reason I feel like she doesn't like me is the fact that she never seems to want to hang out with me. I invite her out to dinner, or over to my house for cards, or whatever, and I always get Oh, I worked a lot today, I'm tired, I just want to relax. Which I understand completely. But every Monday, she goes out to lunch and shopping with a couple of her friends, including a neighbor down the road (who is only a little older than me, and lived with my parents for awhile). I definitely do not begrudge my mom for wanting to hang out with her friends. I'm glad she makes time for herself. I guess I just would like for her to want to hang out with me the way she hangs out with her friends. Maybe that's a bit selfish of me; I'm counting on you to be straight with me. 

I also don't want to paint her in a negative light; like I said, I know my mom loves me. When I need her, she is always there for me. She came to my apartment in the middle of the night when I was struggling with PPD and my husband just didn't understand; she's always quick with advice when I am not sure which road to take; and I know that if I ever truly need her, she will be there. I know she loves me with all of her heart. I guess she just doesn't seem to want to be there unless she is afraid I'm going to fail; unless I really NEED her. I feel kind of like she still sees me as this little kid who she loves and takes care of, but doesn't really want to hang out with when it's adult time. I want to be her friend, though, and I'd like to talk to her and figure out how.

TL;DR: My mom loves me, but I'm afraid she doesn't like me much. How can I talk to her without accusing her of being a bad mom?

She's had boyfriends on and off throughout our friendship, but was never really interested in them and we (our friend group) always sort of suspected that she was gay. She came out last year before Christmas, and nothing has really changed about our friendship- I support her 100%, and she's still one of my best friends and has been helping me through some difficult things in my life recently. 

However, since she has come out, she is constantly putting down men, saying how disgusting they are, how awful they are to women, how they have no right to be superior, etc- all in the name of feminism. I understand that she hasn't had the best of males in her life, including her father, but it's too the point where I'm starting to get offended.

I am a straight female, and in a very committed common-law relationship with a man who treats me like a queen. Our relationship is far from perfect, but he's perfect for me and I love him very much. He would give anyone the clothes off and do anything for his family. We recently took in his brother's children while he got his life together and could provide them with a more stable home and he's been playing the uncle/dad role very well with them.

It's been getting a lot worse recently and she's been putting down my boyfriend for small stupid things- like being late picking me up from work or waking me up early in the morning. Stupid insignificant things, but she sees it as him being an entitled prick who doesn't deserve me. It's to the point where I don't want to tell her anything any more because I'm scared she will just fly off and be negative about it.

She is constantly retweeting radical feminist tweets on Twitter that are uncomfortable to read and often puts down straight girls as well, and anyone that confronts her about it- me included- is against feminism. I am all for equal rights for women and all that jazz, but I don't consider myself a feminist or get involved in it anyway. That's just my personal preference.

25279,Non-Romantic,2lvtpu,"**Background:** Close friends for 10 years, I was also asked to be her bridesmaid for a wedding that did not end up happening 4 years ago (called off 1 month before wedding, after bridal shower &amp; dress purchase). She's a control freak who enjoys the finer things in life.

Fast forward. They get engaged in September, the wedding is in December. Close friends knew prior to the actual engagement that they would be getting married this year as they were originally planning a destination quickie wedding in Las Vegas with close friends and family. 

A few months prior to the engagement it changed from Vegas to a more traditional local wedding **on NYE** without a bridal party (she explicitly stated no bridal party). Then 2 weeks after the engagement is announced I get asked to be a bridesmaid. 

---   

**The details/build-up:** I love my friend but packing all of the traditional wedding festivities, and the cost associated, into 3-ish months at holiday time has been frustrating and really expensive. Speaking of costly, one of the 6 bridesmaids is her 15 year old niece, so we're splitting most things between 5 instead of 6. 

The fine dining venue she chose for her 'cocktail hour with dinner' bridal shower is insanely pricey and then there's the bachelorette. 3 weeks ago through her mother and the MOH she requested we take her on a destination bachelorette party to Miami, 'or maybe Las Vegas.' When the other bridesmaids and myself 'noped' away her mother expressed how much she reeeeeeeeeeeeeally wanted to go out of town.  I guffawed. What the fu...uh, so you fund it? 

IMO an overnight ANYWHERE is over the top, but we were lectured on how upset she would be if her fiance got to go somewhere and she did not. We offered an overnight in Montreal or NYC as alternatives, decided on NYC. From there she led the MOH to book a hotel that is 1k for a 4 person room (we're going to try and jam 6 in), spa appointments, a car service to hold our shopping bags, dinner at a trendy expensive restaurant and then out on the town.

Last Friday the MOH sent out a message saying the bride really wants to do two nights in NYC. Fucking rude. What does the MOH do? Oblige her of course! She and one other bridesmaid will be taking the bride down the night before now.  

---   


I'm looking at almost 2k for this wedding.
Does the bride truly think all of this is reasonable given the abnormally short time frame? Am I just bitter because this is the second time I am paying for some of this stuff? Is the problem more the enabling MOH and bridesmaid/s? I feel like I am taking crazy pills here.

edit: forgot words

**tl;dr**: IMO, Bride has unrealistic expectations and I'm starting to get pissed off. Do I talk to her, the MOH, someone? Just let it go? Holy shit, HELP.

25303,Non-Romantic,32umfn,"To start off, I've been close to my brother, John, ever since we were kids. We didn't live together for most of my childhood, but I looked up to him regardless and always loved him. When I turned nineteen I moved out of our mother's house and moved in with him and his girlfriend, Karen. They were looking for a bigger apartment with a better community, I was just looking to get away from my mother. During the time of the move Karen's sister, Liz, was visiting from her country and  we ended up getting together. This all just serves to complicate my situation.

John, Karen and I all signed the lease for the apartment despite John and I being the only ones paying rent. It was during this time that I realized how terrible of a person Karen is. She had to replace the lightbulbs in their old apartment but didn't think to mark down the wattage required and got the wrong ones. They didn't work and so she decided to round all four of us to go to the store to buy more. She got lost in the store and decided to take it out on Liz by screaming about there being no more shampoo (even though Liz only washes her hair about once a week). I figured she was just stressed from the move and ignored it.


Later on I invited my sister to come over and spend the night at the new apartment. Karen made it hell, screaming and yelling about a box filled with tupperware falling over, throwing things at me and trying to get me to hit her for giving her a dirty look. I went into my room to have a beer and calm down and Liz followed me in, my sister stayed in the living room. After a few minutes she came into my room almost in tears asking me to drive her home. Karen was just yelling about me and making it a very hostile environment and my sister couldn't handle it. I asked Karen to stop and she blew up even worse, saying she would kill me and leave back to her country. John had enough and then drove our sister and I back to our mother's house. It was during the ride that he broke down as much as a man like he can and told me all the horrible things she does, like comparing him to her exes and criticizing his every mistake and pretty much controlling all his money. I decide he's a man and can make his own decisions and don't tell him anything.

But it got worse after Liz went back home. Weekly blowups because she has to do the dishes for the first time in 2 weeks, because there's no laundry detergent, because someone on facebook mentioned someone else or because anyone went out for dinner and didn't invite her. The worst was when John came home after a 13 hour shift, played on his playstation for a bit and then took a shower. Karen went in and asked him if he wanted to go to the store after his shower and he said he was too tired. The walls are thin and I heard the whole conversation. She immediately started screaming about how he doesn't love her and she was breaking up with him and that he shouldn't expect to ever see her again.  She ran out of the house with his car keys and took off. 

The next morning I'm woken up by more of her screaming. It's 5am and Karen is yelling at John about all the money he owes her and all the things she's done for him. She hasn't worked for 2 years at this point and has been supported entirely by John, the only time she's helped him pay the bills at all was a span of 2 months where she borrowed money on his behalf which he of course paid back once he got another job. I'm obviously furious about the things she's lying about and the fact that she woke me up 3 hours before I needed to be, but I keep it in. I do message Liz and tell her I'm annoyed about the yells and wish Karen would talk to a therapist or something. Naturally, Karen hears my ringtone and automatically starts calling Liz and demanding screenshots of our chat. Liz is very submissive and her sisters threats of disownment and suicide made her cave.

I come home to more yelling, Karen telling John to kick me out, what a spineless prick he is, how could he let me walk all over her, etc., and telling Liz to break up with me through the phone and telling her it's my fault she tried to suicide two weeks earlier.

I know it's been about how she treats me so far, but I just wanted to illustrate how terrible she is, but be assured she's even worse to John even if I don't always witness it myself. I moved in with Liz in her country a few months ago and I'm afraid for my brother. She has always tried to remove his friends from the equation and make sure his only friends are HER friends, but not too close. On more than one occasion he's said It's my fault, I know how she gets. She stabbed and hit her last BF on the head with a hammer before he learned to leave. John's relationship with our parents is very strained because of her yelling at them and then convincing him it's their fault. She has told him she'll kill herself if he leaves. It's really toxic.

It seems like a no-brainer at this point, but I'm dating Karen's sister, who loves her too much in my opinion, and is very defensive of her. It will almost certainly break us up. And John loves her too much to leave her just because I said to. He feels responsible for her and it would break his heart to hear his brother tell him to cut this tumor off. What should I do?

25311,Non-Romantic,350nbt,"A little background: 
I've been with my boyfriend (I'll refer to him as J) for 3 years. We started dating in high school, and now we go to the same college. I'm in love with this guy, and he has a warm, loving extended family as well.

J's parents are divorced. From his dad he has two half sisters (32 &amp; 34) who are both married with kids, not to mention plenty of uncles/cousins, too. I have spent a lot of time with J's mom and I have met sisters, brothers-in-law, uncles, cousins, nieces, nephews, etc. numerous times in numerous settings, yet I think I have only met his dad twice (he was very friendly and seemed fine both times). 

His dad has bipolar depression, medical issues, and he is a recovering drug addict/alcoholic. About a year ago, he started going downhill. Since then he has relapsed multiple times, attempted suicide twice, been to rehab twice, and been in and out of hospitals. 

J is, of course, destroyed by this. The problem is that the rest of the family (all over the age of 30, with families and established careers, lives, etc) do not seem to be concerned. It's as if they have all given up on their dad and left it all for J to handle, which is extremely unfair. 

J has to spend a large chunk of his time trying to visit his dad, negotiating with the hospital about rehab, handling the finances/insurance, the list goes on and on. J no longer wants to enable his dad to carry on like this, but his dad is a professional liar when it comes to his addictions. Attempting to care for his dad takes up so much of J's mental capacity that he barely has time or energy to do the things he loves. He can barely focus on school, and he drinks almost every night.

I understand that his dad has an illness and is not trying to hurt his family, but he's a grown man who made his own decisions. I want to be supportive for my boyfriend and not get in the way, but I also want to yell at all the adults in the family for dumping everything on J and yell at his dad for what he's doing to his son. I can see how much it pains my boyfriend, but I don't even know how to talk to him about it or if I should. I don't know what to do.

TLDR: Boyfriend's dad is a drug addict/alcoholic but all the adults in the family have essentially turned their back, leaving it for my boyfriend to handle. What can I do to be supportive/useful?

He really only wanted a casual fling and got carried away like he's done many times before. 

Seeing where this was heading my husband and I warned her that he lies like that.  She was upset, but Bill assured her that he was crazy about her and not to worry. He told her to let her guard down because he was serious about her and needed to hear from her how she feels about him. Jill thinking he's the one falls for him hard. 

Meanwhile my husband knows it's bullshit and is mad at her for not taking our advice in the beginning and generally acted negatively whenever Jill talked about him, but didn't say anything further because it's not his business.  

Bill finally had enough of Jill after three months, he dumped her and she was crushed.

Bill told her he can't date her anymore because he's so busy with work and his kid. And Jill needs some time to figure out her situation (recent divorce, custody arrangements) 
 He lives in our city, but travels for work and is usually gone a couple weeks at a time and when he's home he has a kid. While they were dating he was home for 2 months. 

He apparently tells her that maybe in the future when he gets his promotion and she finalizes her divorce that they can be together. That he meant everything her told her about being serious about her. 

 If he could date anyone out would be her.

 She does not see that he led her on, and that he's a liar.  So she writes him letters, texts him telling him that she would be willing to do a long distance relationship.  That they could even just see eachother for sex while he's home. That she can be understanding, that she's willing to wait for him because he's worth it. 

He says he did try to tell her its over, but she twists his words to bend to her will. 

She doesn't understand its over. When I tell her is over she acts surprised, tells him off, and then they talk and she's convinced he loves her again. It just keeps going around and around.

25316,Non-Romantic,2w7v26,"Hello reddit, I have this problem and I need your opinion, advice and point of view. I know it's a petty problem but I still don't feel at ease. English is not my first language so please excuse me for any mistakes. So here is the story:

Yesterday, I went to the bar with my friend [19F] and my boyfriend [24M] (Minimum age in my country is 18 years, both drinking alcohol and going to clubs/bars.) This bar was really crowded, everyone who was dancing was rubbing against eachother. So ofcourse I did bump into people but it wasn't on purpose. No one did it on purpose. 

There were these two guys on the dancefloor, one started to flirt with me so I ignored them both. This girl [16F] I don't know before this whole thing (Let's call her Ann) switched places with the two boys and started dancing against my back. So I took a step forward, so she wouldn't be touching me the whole time. I spotted three friends of mine [19M] and said hello to them. Suddenly I felt someone rubbing against my back and when I turned around, Ann walked away. I touched my hair and there's a wad of gum in my hair! I was shocked and pissed, while trying to get it out of my hair. These three friends told me to calm down and that she was underage, so I asked them how she got in the bar and apparently she knew the guards. Ann told one of the three boys she díd put the gum in my hair, but that I deserved it because I bumped against her the whole time. I don't get it because I went out of my way to NOT bump into her. I ignored her for the rest of the night.

So while I didn't cause a scene, I still feel like I had to do or say something. I know she's young but to put a piece of chewing gum in someone's hair!? That's very pathetic and nasty. I'm also very attached to my hair and it took me a really long time to grow them out. So if you guys have any advice for me, both for letting it go or what I should do, that would be great.

25325,Non-Romantic,2x3hyh,"Hello reddit.

I need someone to talk about and get advice regarding a friendship. 

I’m a man close to thirty. I’ve been friends with this girl, two years younger than me, for about 3-4 years, give or take a few months. Lets call her Sarah.

**Background/History. You can skip this if you want.**

I was your stereotypical unemployed hardcore no-lifer nerd degenerate. World of Warcaft-stereotype deluxe. Sarah one day was invited into our guild as kind of a joke (we were really good, she was… well, girl-gamer stereotype deluxe). 

It was supposed to be a joke, but what followed were a lot of late night talks and we became friends. I admit I was at times crushing hard on her, especially after getting to know her and meeting her in real-life for coffee. But at the same time I was never head over heels crazy mad desperate in love, because I knew life isn’t a Hugh Grant movie. I wasn’t even sad. The crushing ended after a couple months and I was happy to have a friend to talk to about… “unmanly” stuff. Emotions, feelings, that kind of stuff.

I took a break from WoW back then for a long time because I burned out fast after joining an even better guild and getting a taste of playing at the highest level. 16 hours a day raiding - no thanks. That was before I had a smartphone or the game client allowed chatting with contacts without being ingame. So we lost contact.

Some months later I started a job training, getting back to actually living life and stuff. Finally having a smartphone, we got back into contact. Sporadic. Then I met a girl (who in the long run fucked me up emotionally bad) and turned to the only person who could give me advice: Sarah.

She was a big help, but it should not be. I was pretty fucked up from that girl, part my own inexperience, part that girls crazyness. Sarah tried to lighten my mood a bit, shared some deeper stuff with me. I was at the time getting back into contact with other good friends too, and (fuck up on my part here again) brought some of the stuff Sarah told me up with a friend. A few days later Sarah jokingly said “Btw if you tell anyone, I kill you.”... Well, I’m the most honest person there is and grudgingly told her that I already did. Cue a year of not talking to each other.

Recently I started playing WoW again with the new expansion, I was looking for a raid with my alt char and she was running her own group. Asked her if I could join her group, no problem. We were on Teamspeak (a voice communication tool with different “rooms” people can talk in), and she immediately asked to speak to me in another, empty, room. Like nothing ever happened she started to break down immediately and just flooded me with her worries about her boyfriend, her body image issues, and a lot other stuff. Quite frankly I had a “WTF”-moment. But well, if she trusts me with those deeply personal things - stuff she usually keeps a secret and never talks about - who am I to not offer my help.

Well, the weeks go on and we become really really good “friends” again. Tell each other about a lot of really deep and painful stuff. Talk every night for an hour or two.

Then she gets into her head, just as she was going through the breakup of her five year relationship, that I said something negative behind her back. Not true, btw. She has this issue where she just really flips out when she thinks someone talks about her. I did talk about her with other guys, but nothing personal, nothing negative. I changed a lot in the past two years, and maybe she thought back to that one thing, but I am a whole different person since I got out of my bedroom gaming dungeon and back into the real world. Also at the time I was fighting suicidal thoughts for the first time in 13 years, because I failed oral exams of my job training and lost a really really good job opportunity with a company I was an intern for, litereally a once in a lifetime chance (good money, relocation in one of the greatest cities in the world, a really good “job” and awesome colleagues). She had time to post to her fashion blog, she had time to play WoW, she had time to talk all night to another friend of hers. She didn’t have one minute to talk to me.


**The issue at hand.**

So we are not really talking right now. She is reverting back to a personality she had before her relationship, from what I hear from her friends (before I even knew her). Thing is, she made a lot of friends during that time, she obviously changed and grew as a person and built some things in her life. Which she all puts on hold, no contact. The warmth and kindness is just gone, she is bitchy, doesn’t care about anything good (people, things) that happened during her relationship and is just cold and “gone”.

She kicked me out of her life, her best friend broke off contact with her because she never had time and was “a terrible human being” to him.

I might have reverted back to the pussy weenie guy I was back then and texted her all kinds of emotional vomit, how I am sorry, that she is a good person, that I’m thankful for helping me through some issues, that kinda stuff. I’m kicking myself for doing that. Because with a bit of distance I feel I did nothing bad and SHE was the bad friend, not me. Fucking nice guy pedestal kinda shit.

Two weeks ago a very important friend to me died, and I went AWOL for a while. When I turned my phone back on after a few days I saw she was actually worried that something might have happened to me. I wrote her a short text that I have some shit to deal with, that it was very nice of her to worry, and not to worry.

A few days ago I hit another low point of my life, vomited a few more emotions I’m going through in a text to her (being too easily unbalanced by life shit and stuff like that). She said she doesn’t really know what to say. I told her I need to get my shit together, find myself, lay a solid foundation and would be gone for a while and that she should not worry about me.

It wasn’t nicely worded, I was/am in a dark place and just wrote exactly as I thought. She miiiiiiiiiight have interpreted it as targeted at her…

No reply. She removed me from social media outlets. 

I have this real-life drama to deal with, and on top that friendship drama with her. I feel sick to my stomach because of her, or rather the way things went down in the last few weeks.

I really like her a lot. I’m not in love with her, but we had this really deep and trusting friendship and it’s all gone. She just made me feel good, you know?

Anyway. I feel like puking all day from all the real-life stress plus her drama. I have no idea how to go on from here. I guess the logical conclusion would be to write her off. I don’t make friends easily, and she was the only person who really knew me. I’m don’t WANT to write her off. She is/was a good person for all the years I knew her and it’s easy to make excuses for her because of all her own real-life stuff she went through.

So mainly, I want to stop feeling sick and I want to get that particular drama out of my head so I can focus and deal with my other issues/matters at hand. I also don't want to lose her as a friend, if possible. If we go no contact again for a while things will probably never be like they were before.

What do?

25327,Non-Romantic,2of5q0,"My boyfriend and I live in a house that has been divided into apartments. Our neighbor with us upstairs is wonderful. Our other neighbor, however, we have issues with that I'm really not sure how to handle.

He moved in downstairs a few months after my boyfriend moved in to our apartment. Our previous neighbor down there was great, but he had to move out. This new guy is a PhD candidate who looks like he has never seen the light of day. We've tried to reach out to him and invite him to get to know us, and he has always been rude and unfriendly interacting with us. That's not a big deal; if you don't care to know your neighbors, that's fine. You're not obligated to get to know us, nor do we want anyone to feel obligated, but since we share a house, there are certain considerations that should be taken for each other. Here are our main issues with him:

1) When communicating with each other and our landlord about issues and shared work, he NEVER replies (even to the landlord) or volunteers to help with anything. Our other neighbor always communicates well and tries to do more than her fair share of the yard work/maintenance that we are all supposed to be responsible for.

2) I have an early schedule, but he plays his music with the bass all the way up late at night when I'm trying to sleep. It doesn't happen all the time, so it's not that big of a deal. Still frustrating when it does.

3) Lastly, the laundry... So the electricity/gas/water for the shared washing machine and dryer are billed to us. We knew going in that that's just how things would be set up. It was never an issue with our current and old housemates, but with this new guy, it's driving us both crazy. He does SO MUCH laundry. Like two or three loads every day. The thing is, he doesn't even do full loads. This morning, my boyfriend found six socks in the washer with the load setting on hot/super. Not six pairs, six INDIVIDUAL socks washed on the largest, hottest load setting! One pair of pants and one shirt in the dryer. This is not an unusual occurrence. This is how he does laundry all the time. We've compared our bills from before and after he moved in, and there's a sizable spike from his doing several tiny (hot/super) loads a day. 

He does so much laundry that we barely have a chance to do our own. Every time we try to, the washer seems to be going. If it's done, he'll leave his two pieces of clothes sitting in the washer and dryer for hours or even overnight until he starts the next load. We've started just taking his stuff out and putting it on top until ours is done, then putting his back. Our other neighbor has also expressed that it interferes with her ability to do laundry as well.

We try not to get our landlord involved. He's very understanding of any issues that arise, but he's busy with work and his kids. I feel like there should be some way to compromise if downstairs guy would just communicate with us. This new guy seems to have no consideration for the people living around him. It makes him come off as very selfish and rude. I want to be tactful, but I'm really not sure how to handle the situation. I don't want our annoyance over these things to cause us to act in harsh or petty ways. Are we overreacting? It makes me feel like maybe we're not, since our other neighbor has commented on these things affecting her as well. I feel like by the time a man is nearly 30, he should have something of a grasp on how to be considerate to people he's living with. What do you think? How should we go about working this out?

TL;DR: Inconsiderate housemate/neighbor won't communicate, won't help with shared maintenance duties, plays loud music late at night when others are trying to sleep, and monopolizes the shared washer/dryer, doing tiny loads on the largest, hottest setting and causing my boyfriend and me a big spike in our utilities costs.

Little Sister has asked me questions about jail, and I really want to say, Go ask our sainted mother.  At the same, I don't want to hurt my mom's feelings too badly, I just want her to realize that she played a role in my misbehavior.

25341,Non-Romantic,2j33md,"**TL;DR:** Close friend cuts off all contact for two weeks, then at the last possible minute bails on a weekend trip, including coming with me as my date to a close friend's wedding out of state, citing she 'forgot' to do something for her new job. Not sure if it's legitimate reason and I'm being paranoid, or if it's a bullshit excuse and I just got played. Yes, I put my TL;DR at the top, because that's where I've always thought they belong. 

**Background:** I've know 'Leah' for about 6 months or so now. She started volunteering at an EMS agency I am an officer for, and since she joined we have become quite close. In the time that I have known her, I have quickly come to consider her a close confident and best friend. She has a boyfriend of 4 years (not pertinent to this story, at least I don't think so, but just in case we shall call him Bob, and he is 33). So, no it's not a romantic kind of relationship. I've thought about it, and the best answer I have for that would be: I definitely would not say no if she were ever interested in me, but homie ain't a homewrecker. I may not like the man she's dating, but if she's happy, good for her. I am single. 

**The Story:** Approximately 3 months ago, I received an invitation to go to a wedding of a close childhood friend of mine, Mike. His wedding was yesterday, and occurred out of state (We all live in New Jersey, but his wedding is in Virginia. His fiance's family is from that area, they're getting married at a historic local landmark). I asked Leah if she would like to go with me, and she told me yes. I then happily responded back to Mike that I would be going with a +1.

Now, before I responded back to Mike that I would be bringing a guest, I wanted to make this trip as comfortable for Leah as possible, seeing as a) it was extremely likely that she would not know anyone at the wedding, and  b) she would be out of state for an extended period of time. I thought I came up with a pretty decent plan for the weekend's festivities: We would go down to Virginia on Friday morning/afternoon, stay Friday evening with my sister, whom she has met before (my sister lives in Virginia too, not too far from the venue, and has multiple guest bedrooms available) and hang out/relax, Saturday morning we would then relocate to the hotel which I reserved 1 room with 2 double beds, check in early, hang out with everyone before the festivities began, relax and enjoy ourselves during the wedding, and check out Sunday morning. Sunday (today) I had planned a day in Washington DC with her, to take her to the museums and the aquarium, two things she really enjoys, and spend Sunday evening back at my sister's place before returning to New Jersey Monday morning. Every time I asked her if she was comfortable with all of the arrangements I made, she always told me yes, and always sounded really excited to go.

Fast forward now to about 4-5 weeks ago. Her and I get accepted as part of a group interview process for the EMS division of a major hospital. I have quite a bit of experience in the field and many certifications, whereas Leah has only been doing EMS for barely a year. In the weeks leading up to the interview process, there were many nights were we stayed up until 3AM or longer going through online classes, reading material, and practical exams getting her up to speed and ready for the interview. Interview comes and goes, and she gets the job! I don't, but that's another gripe for another day.

The past two weeks she has been going through the hiring process, including drug screenings, orientation, etc. In those two weeks, I haven't seen nor heard from her, which I found pretty unusual given how close we were, but I initially chalked it up to her just being extremely busy with the process and stressed out. Thursday evening comes, and she still isn't responding to any of my phone calls or texts. I didn't think I was over doing it with the messages and phone calls, as in I wasn't constantly blowing up her phone with a billion of them an hour or anything. Between calling and texting, maybe 2-3 a day over the past two weeks. 

But, anyways. I finally get a hold of her Thursday evening, this is now around 9pm. I ask her if she's still good to go to the wedding, and she says I'm not sure now. I may have to go back up to the hospital to do a uniform fitting. My initial reaction... confusion, lost, maybe a slight hint of Are you serious? I asked her for an explanation, and all she said told me was that she had forgotten to get fitted for her EMS uniform between all the orientation shifts, and that Friday morning was the only day that she could go. Then again, she also states that she had not heard back from her contact whether or not she was even going on Friday. So, OK, fine. I don't have a problem waiting until Friday afternoon to travel, although I was a little annoyed that she had waited to tell me this. I tell her to call me as soon as she knows anything.

Friday morning comes, and I call her a couple times and send a couple of text messages. Nothing. No answer. I was a little concerned now, considering a) DC traffic royally sucks, b) I wanted enough time to let my sister and Mike know what was going on, and c) I still considered this highly unusual behavior from her. I send her one last text saying Hey, please call me when you get this. I'm willing to wait as long as you need, but I need to know what's going on so I can let everyone know. Please call me as soon as you get this. She doesn't call me until almost 4PM. She tells me that we went up to the uniform shop, and they couldn't help her today, but they could tomorrow (Saturday morning). So I say Soooo... does this mean you're not going to the wedding anymore? Yeah, that's what it looks like. I was pissed. I admit that I was a little short her with her on the phone. When I asked her why she didn't tell me any of this was going on, or why she hasn't talked to me in two weeks, her only response was I forgot. Sorry. So, I said Listen, it's whatever now, listen I have to go, I'm gonna start driving down to Virginia, and I have to call my sister and Mike. I'll text you when I get down there, and I guess I'll see you Tuesday (her and I ride on the volunteer ambulance every Tuesday night together).

Since that phone call? Nothing. Leah isn't responding to any of my texts or phone calls again. The wedding came and went (It went well!), and I sit here on Sunday evening in my sister's guest room wondering what the hell happened. 

My questions, and things rolling around in my head keeping me up at night: Why the sudden change in behavior? Was it really an honest mistake and she totally forgot about a uniform fitting, or was there another reason she didn't want to go to this wedding, and just didn't/couldn't tell me? Why didn't/couldn't she do the uniform fitting another day, such as before all of this, or when she got back from the trip? I am totally sympathetic to the fact she's just starting a new job, but to me it does sound kind of like a bullshit excuse. Also, why is she ignoring me? Is there something wrong with me, did I say something wrong? This trip meant a lot to me, and I think she knew that... or did she? Is there some kind of grand scheme/plot at play, such as me only getting used by her to get her the certifications and the job, and now that she has all that, she doesn't need me anymore? Am I being paranoid?

The past few days I have run the range of emotions from hurt, angry, paranoid, disrespected, upset, confused, and anxious, that I just have no idea how to approach this situation anymore. I thought I did everything in my power to make the situation right, and I was strong enough to make it through this weekend without letting any of this get to me and ruin this weekend for anyone, but now, as I get ready to head back to New Jersey in the morning, I ask you all the same thing I am asking myself: *How do I approach this situation? What do I do now? What do I say to her, what do I do if/when I see her next?*

I went to visit her parents place and we needed to let go of some tension since we are on break from college and haven't seen one another since May. We did the deed at some smoky seedy daytime hotel near her parents place and lied to them about where we were.

After I left to return home, somehow, her parents found out what we did. They're religious, and she is less so, and they're freaking out. They may not send her back to school (despite paying tuition already), they want to go to family therapy, and they say I'll never love her because of what we did (we haven't said I love you). They say loads of negative things about me despite not knowing me (or getting to know me during the weekend).

I get it--we fucked up. It was disrespectful to lie to them and we both regret ever even going. The truth of the matter is that neither of us wanted to back down and we were both pretty shaken by the vibe of the seedy motel and how we felt afterwards, not to mention the lying.

They've always been overbearing and disapprove of her changing from a quiet studious girl who moved around a lot as a child/teen into someone who feels secure in a location (she won't move where she spends most of her time when she is in college) and has more friends and a bigger social life. She still studies hard and works tirelessly for great grades, but her parents also don't see how much happier she has been since that change began (long before we began to date).

25361,Non-Romantic,2hcs4i,"It's about time I tell my parents that I don't want to be part of my family anymore. 

I've never really enjoyed family since the age of around 9+. When I was kid all the cousins used to hang out together in the summer. So 4 boys (6-8) and me(8) normally. It would normally end with them ganging up on me and me hiding in a room pushing the door to keep it closed. (Apart from the occasions where I managed to sway them to gang up on someone else) Every time I was behind that door crying I would wish I could be elsewhere in another family or with no family. It's not super important  this part because as I got older I just avoided them and didn't play with them and now we can all (cousins) hang out and be a bit more civilised because we are older 17-20. I assumed it was how kids normally hanged out I grew up playing wrestling etc. but I still hated it. 

Then as I got older (12/13+) things in my house got mental. There was always screaming, arguing, plate smashing, hair pulling, door slamming and crying. It got so bad my sister (15) packed her bags and was ready to run away until my mum locked the door to stop her. My heart sank at that point because if she could leave maybe i could too. I found out that all the yelling was because my dad was cheating on my mum (potentially still is, cannot confirm but high chance) There was a point when my sister knew and my mum didn't and my dad used to beat her up because of that (according to my sister). These are my parents for context. When my sister moved out (to uncles) for a year it was peaceful but I still didn't want to be there. Even though a year elapsed my mind hadn't changed.

During the whole time above my mum always used to come to me and my siblings crying saying she was just going to take us and drive off a cliff. I always wanted to go and get divorce papers and have them mailed home or fill them out for my parents. I never did because I was stupid and probably would have gotten caught looking back at it now.

I then started dating a guy who my parents did not like because he was not the same race as us. This made me not like them even more because even though they care it was about how other people would perceive it and how it would affect me and my kids in the future. I was 17 at this time. The chances I would stay with this dude were slim. (We are not together anymore sidenote) and if I did chose to have interracial kids it should be my decision to decide how it would affect me and if i wanted to do it not theres. 

This is the main factor I want to talk to them and tell them:

* I dont like the way they are.
* The kind of people they are.
* The community that they(we) are apart of.
* And that I don't want that in the future. 

When I started uni I was so glad to leave and not have to be at home for the first year. After which I moved back home but still haven't gotten over my past hatred and dislike for being in this house and with these people. 

My dad has been physically abusive (not to me) as recently as last year when he punched my sister on holiday for something that was my brothers fault. My mum will try and emotionally blackmail people. (Doesn't work with me but she gets to my sister alot!) My granddad (who I live with) I recently found out used to ask our babysitters for sex when we were kids and offered to pay them on more than one occasion. He also has anger issues.

This is my situation. I need to talk to them, it drives me mad and makes me unhappy. The talk may result in leaving me homeless, I made no money this summer and rent where I live is HIGH! I can couch surf for a bit and can leave a suitcase in uni lockers and sleep in the library except for on Fridays as a WORST CASE SCENARIO. It won't be fun but I just got out of a relationship which was the only reason I stayed at home. To give me and dude a chance without the stress of me being homeless. Now I don't have that holding me back. As much as my parents hated him he was the only thing keeping me there ironically. 

I am scared. My dad's not home yet but I don't know how to start this conversation and how to not let it escalate. Advice please?

I want to talk to them as opposed to leaving straight out because:

Jim left and has never met Julia, though it is pretty much confirmed that she is his biological daughter and Jim paid child support for the two of them. Bev continued raising Mark and Julia by herself as a single mother. She never remarried or had any known relationships since then.

Jim moved to Arizona with a new wife and her children and raised them to adulthood. The new wife sent Mark a birthday card once blaming Mark for never calling Jim and being a terrible son. Since then, Mark has had no contact with Jim.

We know most of Jim's family life from Facebook. He has a public profile so it's easy to see his pictures and statuses. He treats the new wife's kids as if they were his own and now has grand daughters and grandsons over in Arizona and he really dotes over them. It looks picture perfect if you ignore the fact that he abandoned his biological children.

About 2 years ago, Jim's wife died.  Since then, Mark has been approached by various family members to reach out to Jim.  Mark friended him on facebook, but they've never chatted.  Every so often, Jim will comment on Mark's statuses but Mark never replies.

Every time this happens, Julia gets very upset, understandably.  She feels abandoned and rejected because Jim has never so much as acknowledged her existence outside of child support which ended years ago.  

I hate seeing them like this.  Mark doesn't see it as a big deal and he usually laughs whenever Jim posts something.  They have the exact same political and religious stances and the same since of humor.  We've talked about reconnecting with Jim, but I would feel horrible about it with Julia being out of the picture.  

I want to ask Mark to just block Jim.  Julia has never expressed any desire to contact Jim.  We're a pretty tight-knit family and I feel that this has put a wedge between Mark and Julia that will only push them further apart.  This has been going on for 2 YEARS.  I thought something might resolve itself by now, but it hasn't.

Should I just go ahead and message Jim and tell him how we feel?  I've started the message about 5 times, but Mark tell me not to kick the hornets nest.  He sees this as a benign and I don't think he realizes how this is really hurting Julia.

My best friend, Malcolm, who I've known for my entire life and is basically my brother, has recently started this sharp mental decline and is now convinced he is being followed, spied on and sabotaged by the government, and is collecting money to move to Germany.

I've known Malcolm since birth, his mom and my mom were best friends and had us both around the same time.  When I was 15 years old, Malcolm's mom committed suicide by leaving her car running in the garage of their house.  Unfortunately, somehow this sparked a fire and Malcolm's house was burned to the ground.   After his mother's death, it was just him and his dad.  Malcolm's dad kind of took a tailspin and his brother (Malcolm's uncle) some how managed to finagle most of the insurance money from the house and ran off.   To make a long story short, Malcolm spent a lot of his time with me and my family after that, and we all love Malcolm, he *is* part of our family.

After graduating from H.S., Malcolm and I lived together at my parents house and just did odd jobs and just sort of partied and hung out.  I eventually decided I wanted to go to school, so I started going to a local community college, but Malcolm wasn't really interested in school.  He did well in H.S., and I remember all of our teachers loving him, but, he just wasn't into it, he wanted to hang out and party.  He ended up getting a job at a video games store where he met Claire. 

Claire's family life is pretty similar to Malcolm's.   Claire's mom died when Claire still was very young, and Malcolm has told me Claire was abused by both her father and her older brother.  About a year after their meeting, Claire and Malcolm got married and Malcolm moved out of my parent's house and into an apartment with Claire.  

At first, everything was great.  Claire and Malcolm were very happy and they seemed perfect for one another.  Malcolm could be really boisterous and silly, and Claire was quiet, and kept him grounded.  Malcolm took out a loan for a house, Claire got pregnant, everything was going really well for them and my family and I were besides ourselves happy to see Malcolm doing so well and 

Unfortunately, when the housing bubble burst, it was horrible for Malcolm, just as his son was born, Malcolm found himself in way over his head.  Claire had either quit or got fired from her job at the game store, and Malcolm began moonlighting as a floor cleaner in addition to his job at the games store.  He eventually lost the house, and Claire insisted they move in with her grandmother (who pretty much raised Claire).  During this time, Claire got pregnant again (Malcolm told me she told him she was on birth control) and Malcolm was working something like 80 to 90 hours a week.  It was around this time I went away to college, and kind of lost contact with Malcolm save for messages relied through my mom when she would see him.

After college, I came back home and started looking for a job.  For the longest time I would only see or talk to Malcolm sporadically, my mom said he was too busy to come visit much.  One interaction, one of the most recent before a deluge of panicked communiques (more on that later) he messaged me on Facebook from a really bizarre profile and asked if I wanted to buy a couch.  I knew he had been struggling with money, so I took him up on the offer, went over to his place, looking forward to seeing my best friend again.  The couch was this obvious salvaged piece of junk he must've found on a street corner.  He wanted $500, and I obliged.  However, the whole interaction made me really uneasy, Malcolm seemed almost angry with me, which I chalked up to feeling betrayed that I left for so long and didn't stay in contact.  I asked him if I could come in for a beer or something to catch up, but he said Claire wasn't feeling well.

This happened about a years ago, and was really all the communication I had with Malcolm other than a Happy Birthday texts or something, until about 2 months ago.  Malcolm came into my work, which he had never done before.  One of my colleagues told me a deranged man wanted to see me and asked if I wanted to call the police.  I looked to see who it was, and it was Malcolm, he looked so incredibly tired and skinny.  It was shocking, I almost didn't recognize him.  I brought him into my office and he was all over the place like he had just been in an accident or something.  I eventually got him to calm down and sit.

This marks the beginning of what I can only see as a complete unravelling of Malcolm's mental state.  Without going too far into it, Malcolm very lucidly (but manically) explained to me that the government has been watching him, following him, and now they're coming after him.  I didn't know what to say at first, I asked him how he knew that.

Malcolm is extremely intelligent.  I always felt he was smarter than me, and I honestly felt like he also got a lot of bad luck, that was the only reason I could surmise why my life seemed to be going better than his, and I thought he was holding that against me.  

Also, Malcolm is good at arguing.  He can make his point concisely and effectively, and is very persuasive.  For about 30 minutes he explained that the NSA had been tracking him and Claire for years.  He said that he's gotten them both into something he shouldn't have, and that he needs to escape, he always mentions Germany, I don't know why, but Germany is a common motif for Malcolm.  When questioned his story, he started showing me article after article on the internet of things corroborating what he was saying.  He said they have information on all of us, and can make anyone they want disappear if those people act up.

At first, I was shocked, the articles he showed me really seemed to support what Malcolm was saying.  I had heard about the Wikileaks stuff and NSA, but, I didn't really scratch more than the surface.  The things Malcolm showed me were horrifying, and he had me convinced he and Claire might be targeted.

I told him to go to my house and we would talk about it after work.  He refused and left.

The whole thing happened so fast, and I had no reason not to believe Malcolm, he was convinced.  I was floored this was happening to him.  I started reading the articles he had showed me more carefully, and I found a lot of them were mostly blog posts, or links to stuff like infowars, or some of them were just normal stories about NSA on CNN or something like, but Malcolm has this uncanny ability to read between the lines and find something really sinister and connected directly to him.

About two weeks after that, the manager of the video games store he worked at got in contact with me and asked what the fuck happened to Malcolm.  Apparently Malcolm made a really big scene and quit.  I told him I don't know what's going on.  That's when the text messages started.  Daily I get dozens of text messages from Malcolm from different phone numbers, they're usually just links to random conspiracy blogs or websites or long ramblings.  I can sometimes get him to meet up with me for lunch, and I'll feed him.  The most recent lunch we had was right around the attacks in Paris.  He's convinced those attacks were a government conspiracy and that they'll be coming for him soon.  He always stresses that he has to go to Germany.

I went over to Malcolm's house unannounced a week ago.  I knocked on the door, and Malcolm opened it crack.  I somehow convinced him to let me, and we walked to the living room where Claire was watching TV.  We all sat down.  At first, I felt relieved, the house looked fine and their two babies looked healthy and happy, which was a huge concern of mine.  I felt maybe Claire needs an ally in this fight against Malcolm's degrading mental state.  In hindsight, I think Claire's grandma keeps the place clean and keeps the children fed.  After the conversation began rolling, it became clear to me that Claire and Malcolm were feeding each others paranoid thoughts, and that Claire was just far gone as Malcolm.  

I don't know what I was thinking, I think I was shocked that Claire seemed as manic as Malcolm, but I started arguing with them.  I know I've said this before, but Malcolm is very smart, and every paranoid assertion I tried to negate he had 5 or 6 other points he could make.  We went back and forth for about 15 minutes, and that was when I noticed Claire getting really angry. Claire is usually very quiet, and any interaction I had with her was usually with Malcolm in the room, but suddenly this quiet, diminutive girl is getting in my face and threatening to kill me, she's screaming at the top of her lungs that I'm one of them and that Malcolm needs to do something. 

Malcolm, at this point, tries to calm her down, but she is out of control, climbs on top of me and starts hitting me.  Malcolm pulls her off of me and she runs into the kitchen.  Malcolm tells me I need to go, she, and I'm not kidding, runs out of the kitchen with a fucking knife.  Malcolm grabs her arm and I get out as fast as I can.

I have not gone back to their house.  But I'm still getting messages from Malcolm.  One of the first after the incident at his house was something about how he knows I'm not a bad guy, and that I have to believe him.  He's been asking my family for money, assumedly to get to Germany.  He was getting it, too, for a little bit, until I had to sit down everyone and tell them what's been happening with Malcolm.  I think my mom still gives him money without my knowing, Malcolm will sometimes hint at it.

I'm besides myself.  I don't know what to do.

25402,Non-Romantic,1ulscu,"Okay. A bit of a back story. He is my step brother. I do not know him overly well. I have known him for 8 years, but we never kept communication constant until recently. 

Red flag one was he came over to my place (drove) drunk off his face, lied to his girlfriend about where he was and crashed on my couch. He woke up at 7am the next morning to down a 6 pack of beer before driving home at 9am.

A few weeks pass, and my mom calls me asking me to add his girlfriend to facebook, didn't give me any more details. I add her, she has a 5 year old son. She then tells me she has no one to talk to, and because of the field I work in (social work) asked if I could help.

She goes into detail about the abuse. Him hiding her keys, purse, and phone so she couldn't leave. Screaming at her, mental abuse. Breaking her window when he was mad, holding her son hostage. She called the police and they threatened to take away her kid if this kept up. She sends me pictures of bruises... divulges everything because she has no one else to talk to.
--I am shocked at this point. I can't believe my brother is capable of this, yes his father was.. but he saw it first hand, he was there too. I know abuse effects people differently and it cycles.. I have no doubt in my mind she was lying, just in shock. I trusted him. In my home.

I talk her how to get out, we make an escape plan. We find a place she can afford, move her son immediately to safer housing. She stayed in a hotel and got the fuck out. Thank god.

Now here's where my confliction lies. I do not agree with abuse. I got in this field to help others who go through hard times get out. I have been the victim of abuse, and do not find it okay what so ever. But in my morality book.. being a helper comes just above hating abuse. I have always felt if I could help someone, if they needed someone... I had to be there for them. I could not walk away, or turn a blind eye as you never know when you are someone's last hope. I am very empathetic and with my kind of work have helped all kinds of people who have been abusers and abused.

I want to reach out to my brother. He has no idea I helped his now ex, that I know, or even am aware they had broken up. But I also know, he doesn't have many people left in his life either. I want to reach out, but this feels so morally conflicting as I am so angry and hurt for this woman and her child.

I guess I'm asking what you would do, and your reasoning behind your choice. As I truly feel as I am stuck in a major moral dilemma. 

TL;DR; Found out my step brother was abusing his girlfriend. She went into detail about the abuse towards her and her son. I helped her get out safely without any more harm to her or her child.. but am feeling conflicted on whether I should reach out to my brother to offer him support and help him find help as well.

25421,Non-Romantic,202vbs,"So I'm friends with this girl, lets call her Mary. Freshmen year of highschool Mary and I were best friends. Inseparable, always laughing until we're wheezing and hanging out almost everyday. She was my best friend and we always had great times together.

 Now, fast forward to now, my senior year of high school. She rarely texts me. When I text her she usually ignores it. We've hung out once, maybe twice for about an hour or so since the beginning of senior year. I told her last year I would give her rides from from school every day, because.. you know, she was my best friend. Now, car rides are awkward, she doesn't talk to me, and we've simply fell apart. I still value whats left of our friendship, but I don't want to give her rides anymore since it's pretty obvious at this point she's just making the bare minimum effort to be friends just so she doesn't have to take the bus. I know if I tell her I'm not giving her a ride anymore, that's the end of our friendship. 

As much of a shitty friend she is, she still has mutual friends with me and making it awkward with the tension is not what I need right now. But giving her a ride home is awkward and now a nuisance to me. But she still sits with me sometimes at lunch because she has no other friends and... I just have NO idea what to do.

So I'm taking a test (the MCAT) in approximately two months, in addition to taking a short four week course three days a week from 6-9pm on test preparation, and working 9-5 in a lab from Monday to Wednesday. In order to prepare for the test, it has been recommended to me to prepare for about 300-400 hours, which I've calculated out to be about 5 hours a day, with a little extra on weekends and a break on Friday night. (I shouldn't even be writing this post, but it has been bothering me)



I am also living with my two friends Lily and Maggie in an apartment we just got this year, both of whom are also working 9-5pm in lab over the summer, and one of whom is studying for the GRE, though she has said that she doesn't need to study for it and that it's a joke. Up until this week, I've been very good about doing my chores, paying for groceries (I don't go grocery shopping with them admittedly), helping to cook, cleaning up, etc. My friends aren't as clean as I am, so sometimes I do a little bit extra just to make sure everything is neat, but that's not a big deal since I know that I'm the nitpicky one, and I kind of thought that was what friends were about, doing a little extra here and there, giving and taking without needing to keep track. Additionally, if my boyfriend eats over (and he always eats from my share of course), he'll do the dishes.



My friends have not been incredibly understanding about my need to study for this test. They knock on my door even when the do not disturb sign is up, and when I told them to please stop, they told me that it was kind of rude. I had requested that we split the chores slightly unevenly on the days that I have class in return for extra work once my test is over, but they didn't like that request. They hold loud dinner parties/have loud friends over/watch loud movies several times a week, so I have to walk 20-25 minutes away to go to a quiet cafe and return past midnight. I thought I was being fairly accommodating; I know it's not fair of me to tell them to not have fun just because I can't.



However, this week, my class started, meaning that I do not have time to go back to my apartment for dinner, and I hadn't realized that most school cafes and stores close at 5 so I didn't take the weekend to make dinner for myself this week, which I would have done if I had known. My options for today's dinner, therefore, are leave lab early, run to a school cafe and pay 7 dollars for dinner, stay up until 2 or 3 am to make myself food, or ask my roommates to make a little bit extra of whatever they eat for dinner (since I did pay for the groceries). I figured it wouldn't be that big of a deal for just one day, and when I got home at 9:30, saw the food in the fridge, I made sure to thank them profusely for making me extra.



While I was studying, both of them knocked on my door and told me that for fairness sake, I should do the dishes for today if they are going to spend two hours making me dinner. I was kind of confused since the dishes were also from their breakfasts + lunches, and they had said that making extra for dinner wouldn't have required extra work since it is done in bulk. (I tend to just eat a bowl of cereal for breakfast and rinse it out afterwards, I don't like leaving dirty dishes out). Additionally, there have been times where one of my roommates has been out and I've made extra and set it aside for her, and since I don't like leaving dirty dishes for a long time, I just do everything for the day and go back to studying since I cook fast and eat fast.



I made this point clear, but they told me that they felt like they were both cooking for me and cleaning for me (which was insulting for me, since this was literally only a one time thing) and that I wasn't really pulling my weight, and that in reality, this was all just a big favor for me. I could tell that they had been stewing all evening about it. I told them that I didn't want them cooking for me anymore or including me on the grocery list for this week (I'll be spending most of my week on campus, what's the point? I was originally just going to split it evenly with them since I figured it was only a couple dollars of difference, but I was admittedly pretty sour after what they had said.) They also said they were just trying to work out a system for the future where they spend 1 hour cooking and I spend half an hour washing dishes, which I knew was a lie since I had said that the dinner favor would only be for today, and that isn't a favor, that's just splitting the chores fairly.



I think I'm in the right, though I'm trying to understand from their perspective as well. I know that if one of them was studying for a really big test coming up soon and I didn't have any obligations, I would make extra every day (though I am a more efficient cook than them). I don't feel terribly welcome at my apartment, so I left early today and probably won't return until late. I'm going to start spending Sunday cooking in bulk so that I don't have to spend time cooking dinner after my class (So also if you guys have any suggestions on easy portable dinners, please say something!).

25436,Non-Romantic,2jrewc,"I grew up in a religious family, with a lot of older siblings. My parents never had time for all of us, and generally focused on the older ones and they'd help out the younger ones. My parents completely paid for college for the oldest two, but after they graduated, my dad lost his job and didn't have one for 7ish years. My parents felt awful about it, but they couldn't pay for the rest of us and we had to work through it on our own. Making it through college was the toughest time in my life so far (I know a lot of people go through this, but it was tough expecting one thing and at the last minute, dealing with something else), but it couldn't be helped and I tried to deal with it on my own and not burden the rest of my family.

I moved away from my family when I got older (although we're all still close) moved away from my religious upbringing, and am pretty happy. My parents both have jobs, but they've had to start from scratch building their retirement and aren't in a good financial place.

My parents are now at an age where they can take from their 401k or something, and three months ago, my parents helped my 2nd oldest sibling buy a second house, as an investment for themselves as well. But then two months ago they used more to help my oldest buy a house, too. They tried to keep it a secret, and when I found out, I acted in ways I didn't know was possible anymore. I cried and shook, and was so mad at everyone involved.

We were all together (super rare but it happened), so we all talked about it and I (and the other siblings it affected) told my parents how upset it made me, and while they were sad that I was sad, it was pretty clear nothing would change. I guess I knew that's the way things were, but it hurt to actually hear them say it.  Since then, I've considered going back to see a therapist (I've seen different ones at different times in my life - probably about 2.5 years total), because I just can't stop thinking about what's happened, and it's been two months. It's like I've been making excuses for my parents my whole life and this just broke it all. They've given the oldest two each at the least $100,000 more than the rest of us, visit them more, and talk to them more than any of the rest of us. Scenarios come to mind of when I've needed help and they have said they can't. And when I see or talk to the oldest two, it just reminds me of everything all over again.

So I guess I just wanted to hear from other people who have been the favorite child, or who haven't. Or people who love some of their kids more. How it's affected relationships between the parents and their kids, or between the kids themselves. How people have moved passed it? Or does it stick around forever?

I think I might be an example of a Nice Guy (TM) and I have been categorised as such in the past. I'm courteous and polite (perhaps too much so) and I can get very highly strung when dealing with women. I've been told that perhaps my problem in this regard is that I see all women as potential girlfriends rather than people.

I feel that if this were true, my problems would be a lot easier to resolve. Unfortunately, the problem is is that I don't know if this is strictly true. I'm a diagnosed Aspergers (the mother of a friend of mine happened to be a specialist on autism and provided a diagnosis and then I had a confirmed diagnosis from another psychologist recently who provided me with some advice on social anxiety which was really useful). I don't bandy it about (I hate using it as a crutch) and only my family and 1 or 2 friends are really aware of it. 

When it comes to relationships, I feel like a dog chasing tyres - I kind of enjoy dating, but I really wouldn't know what to do if I found myself with someone who wanted a relationship. So I don't even get to the thinking about the girlfriend part because I'm completely lost at sea as to what to do next. I don't know if this is a consequence of aspergers or something else. Until I was about 21 I really wasn't even sure of my sexual orientation. 

I was pretty happy with being an asexual and then I met a woman who kind of made me aware of the fact that I was straight (although she was in a relationship, so I did nothing and we became good friends). Since then I have dated a string of other women, although nothing has happened. Either it reaches a tipping point and they find someone else because they are not attracted to me or for whatever reason, or I just don't know how and when to progress it to the next level.

Now the woman I have referred to above has told me recently (after we hung out a few times) that she has recently become single. And this has left me in something of a state of paralysis (unfortunately all my social anxiety/awkwardness training that I have worked really hard on has gone out the window). On the one hand, I like her a lot, and I would probably ask her out on a proper date if I had a iron clad rock solid indication she liked me (unfortunately all I have is circumstantial evidence). On the other hand, I kind of just liked hanging out with her and wish that things were back the way they were because that would be just a whole lot less stressful. I'm also paranoid that I'm going to blow things up between us and lose our friendship.

Then, I do the stupid thing and I try and re-establish the status-quo friendship by just trying to smalltalk via facebook and defuse the situation. Eventually (and quite reasonably) she gets annoyed with me and tells me to stop doing it. Now she wants to meet me and a mutual friend of ours for lunch (this was something we had planned a while ago). I'm trying to work out how not to fuck this up and end up blowing things out of the water. 

Basically it goes like this; if she wants to be friends, I'm cool with being friends. But if she wants something more, I would not turn her down. How do I not fuck up?

I feel like I need reassurance in wanting him out of my life. And I think the main reason I'm unsure is that even though we've never got along it pains me that I don't have a loving relationship with my brother. 

My brother has never hit me or done anything life threatening. But he has a special power to make me feel like dog shit under his shoe, and the reactions of my family when he bullies me remind me that he is in the golden child. Some examples of his behavior are:

-Knowing I am bipolar, but mocking me over it (ie asking why don't I go lock myself in my room and cry some more, telling me I should hurry up and kill myself, telling me my problems aren't bad and to get the fuck over it because mom and dad are sick of me) 

-Always acting like I'm overreacting. (Telling me to calm down, to relax, that I'm making a scene.) 

-calling me a bitch, constantly

-the last three times, over the course of two months, that I've tried to hang out with him he has said yes and then blown me off by not answering his phone or just not coming over to my house. 

-last year during mental health awareness week I made a fb status stating that I have a diagnosed mental illness, I'm receiving 
 treatment for it, and I made status to fight the stigma surrounding mental illness and treatment. There was an outpouring of support. Except him. He texted me saying I should take it down because that's personal and embarrassing.

-his go to hit whenever we fight is to tell me I'm fucking crazy and mom and dad hate me. 

He always tries to get a rise out of me and push my buttons. My friends see it. They tell me he's an asshole to them as well. My family sees it to. But they say don't give him a reaction, that's what he wants. Brothers do that. That's just how he is. WHAT. So I'm supposed to take bullying and verbal abuse because that's just how he is? 


Add in the fact that he's the golden child and the way my mother treats him makes me resent him even more. 

After an incident on at game night on Saturday where he yelled at me for giving a point to the wrong team I yelled back ok well I couldn't hear!! (I'm hard of hearing.) and he's like whatever she's so fucking crazy. This comes after being rude to me all day. I snapped. I yelled back. I told him he was an asshole and I was leaving. My mother yelled at ME for causing a scene and told ME to lower my voice and not swear in my aunts house. 


This was the last straw. I told her I would no longer be attending any get togethers or functions if he was there because it has been made very clear to me that he can provoke and verbally attack me but I will be the one put on the chopping block. 


The only reason I'm not cutting off my mother as well is that my aunt kind of laid into her and something clicked in her head. She came to find me at karaoke just to tell me she loved me and I'm amazing and she hopes I have a good night.

25449,Non-Romantic,2ra8gj,"OK. This is my first time posting here, so if I fudged anything with formatting or if I’m talking in circles, then I’m sorry.


I  (23F) am seeking advice on how to best handle the situation, whether it be cutting ties or trying to fix the relationship.  I've been bothered by my friends' (24F and 25M) behavior, to the point where I am beyond brushing it under the rug; not sure if trying to talk to them about it will escalate immediately to a fight; wondering if it's just better to walk away.  

There's a general question behind all of this, which is, How do you know if you should stay and work on a friendship, or if it's better to just back off and walk away from it?  


I've known John (25M) since August, I’ve known Annie (24F) since September, and she was quickly becoming one of my closest friends here until she and John started dating. I considered myself fairly good friends with John and Annie, individually. We hung out a lot, and we all shared a lot of laughs together.  I don't know how important or relevant it is to any of this, but we all live in Japan.  I have successfully made other friends.  They have not.  For the past two months, I have essentially been the only other person they hang out with.  


*  After the two started dating, John seems to reach a threshold (when I’m around) where he wishes I wasn’t there so he could just be with Annie alone. He gets very snappy and demanding, and Annie seems to passively roll over and let him talk to me in a derogatory way, and let him lead the group. Sometimes, she passively engages in / supports that behavior.


* *Example:* When we were waiting for a train, I decided to look up the weather. Upon seeing that it would be snowing every single day that week, I told them. John informed me that I didn’t need to be doing that because “we were in public.”  He said it in a really snappy and condescending way that offended the you know what out of me.   Like, dude. I’m telling you there’s gonna be a blizzard on Monday. I’m not reading you an excerpt from a trashy romance novel. Annie looked startled at first, but then she grabbed his left hand with both of hers and then gave me a cross between an apologetic look and a sneer.


*  Annie is overly desirous of being the center of John’s undivided attention. I totally get that, but when you’re hanging out as a group, it’s not appropriate. That’s just my opinion. If we hang out as a group, and John spends too much time talking to me or one of my other friends, Annie will start to look really pissed-off, and will make it increasingly obvious that she is pissed-off. On a weekend trip they took with me and my friends Mayumi (F) and Daichi (M), they spent the entirety of one day solely absorbed in talking to each other and ignoring everyone. Mayumi felt so uncomfortable, she left early the next morning. When John divided his attention equally among Annie, Daichi, and me, well, let’s just say Annie was a total drag. She was huffing and puffing, and slamming stuff.  Daichi told me he thought their behavior was really strange.


* We have a group chat. Recently, if I ask them a question (usually relevant to plans we all made) they will both just look at it (I can see that they’ve read my post) and ignore it. I’m starting to feel like I’m the butt of some crazy joke. I actually posted 3 times in our intimate group chat, 2 times asking legitimate questions which were read and never answered, and once to answer a question (Are you coming today?). The answer being, “No, I can’t come today. I’m sick and not fit to be out. Sorry guys.” Not even a, “Feel better!”


It seems like when they started dating, they went from being two really fun and easygoing individuals to a singular entity that works solely to sustain/destroy itself. Because of our previous, solid friendship, I am having a hard time determining if there is something that can be done to fix our relationship, whether or not I want to fix the relationship, if I should just walk away, etc. 


So, Reddit, if you were me, what would you do?


Also, is it actually embarrassing to tell someone how it's going to blizzard four out of the seven days of the week? Like, am I socially unaware of something?

However, we texted a lot during the day about some pretty personal stuff. A few weeks in, she started driving me crazy, just eating up all of my time with texts about her problems and then not taking no for an answer, whether it ranged from some new gadget she insisted I just HAD to buy, bugging me to hang out when I was extremely busy and stressed and said I couldn't, texting me at all hours, etc., in spite of me repeatedly telling her that I couldn't get together yet, couldn't text as much, whatever.

Ultimately, I felt like our relationship required CONSTANT boundary setting on my behalf when it came to every. little. thing. and it was becoming very exhausting for me. So I ignored her last few texts.

It's just that every time I tried to explain myself in the past, she didn't care and took it as more ammo to continue to pressure me to do whatever I said I didn't want to do.

I started my first job ever about 3 weeks ago. It's in a medical office and I have a pretty simple desk job with my own personal desk and space. I'm the youngest here by about 15 years and I'm also the only male in the office, aside from a doctor who comes in once a week.

My job does not require me to communicate with anyone, it's all on the computer, but I still greet all of my coworkers when I come in and I'm always open to conversation if someone else initiates. 

I put an iPhone charger in my desk space to use whenever I'm low on battery and if you know anything about apple products you'll know that these things aren't cheap, especially not for a college student who only has 1 paycheck to his name. This charger was also brand new. 

I come in to work the other day and the charger + cable are gone. I check all my drawers and cabinets and nothing. I ask my coworkers who in turn ask the rest of the staff and nobody knows anything. My desk is situated so that everyone has to walk by it to get to the front desk (many coworkers have to get there throughout the day) and this allows them to see everything in my desk. Furthermore, one coworker that I do not know who usually stays in the other office 20 min away was apparently at my office when the charger went missing and was constantly walking by my space which makes me suspicious of her (I have never met her though). Now, I'm paranoid everyday I come in of my things being stolen from me.

My best friend Jess (we've been super close friends for 4 years), started seeing Dan at the beginning of October; it all became 'official' very quickly (within days of them meeting) and they have spent almost every minute of the day together since, which  is fine if she's happy with that.

Her previous 'relationships' can be more accurately described as fuck buddys, and they were usually much older men, which she was happy with and she was being safe so I was happy as long as she was. 

Two weeks into their relationship (and after just three weeks of knowing each other) Jess puts this big speech on facebook about love and such and how she would change for him... bit weird. After that, it was like our friendship changed overnight, she stopped texting me like she used to, wouldn't take my calls etc she even quit her job because 'she didn't like it' but as a 21 year old with no qualifications, it was a strange move.. but meant she got to spend more time with Dan.

Now, I knew from the offset that Dan didn't like me; I thought it was because he was a student and I'm working, and that he probably thought I was a bit of a party pooper as I go home a little earlier from nights out etc. cue Jess' birthday a couple of weeks ago where he told me to my face that he didn't like me and told Jess he didn't like her hanging out with me. In all honesty, I've only seen her 3/4 times since they started seeing each other as we live in different cities but this made me glad as I wouldn't have to deal with Dan much. 

Jess' birthday, what a marvel... not. We went to a new club with a group of friends (Dan had not arrived with his friends yet)  and it was rubbish, really bad music, bad atmosphere etc so Jess and I decided to go to our usual joint instead, I must have asked her three times if she was sure she wanted to relocate and she said yes. She went off to get her coat and I gathered people from the dancefloor. As we were about to leave Dan turns up, tells her that she's not going anywhere and that he's staying at this new club... I told him that we had decided we were moving on and he then accused me of ruining Jess' birthday trying to get my 'own way' and moving her along when she didn't want to. I looked to Jess for support, at least for her to say she was going to move but momentarily decided to stay but nothing... she stood there and watched me talk this verbal abuse from him and when the others saw she had not backed me up, they all jumped on the bandwagon and soon I was the bad guy... This prompted me and my SO to just walk off and leave before it turned nasty.. I was shocked, even my SO's first response when we were out of earshot was 'WTF is she playing at?!' 

After this, I was quite angry and didn't text her for a fortnight (she never text me either) but my concern got the better of me (just before her birthday she mentioned she was worried about how much Dan was drinking, having previously dismissed it as student life, but now she thought it may have been more than that) and I messaged her to see how she was. She responded straight away and pretended nothing had happened on her birthday; but did tell me that she was sick of how lazy Dan was and how he was always late...

I managed to persuade her to come visit me in my city recently and it was like I had the old Jess back.. for a while. She's recently become more withdrawn and calmed down a lot (she used to be a bit of a party girl) but I saw this side again when we went out together. This was until he started texting her every 20 minutes to check where she was, who she was with to which Jess responds 'Aww, he really cares about me.' I made a joking comment about passing me the sick bucket (with a slightly forced grin on my face, but light heartedly nevertheless) to which she responds 'You're just jealous! You'll never have a relationship like mine, or a boyfriend like Dan!' I just looked at her and she continued the night like she'd said nothing. No apology. I had to resist the temptation to just ditch her in this alien city 200 miles from her home. 

This isn't the kind of friendship I want, I've always said I'm happy as long as she is but I'm not 100% convinced it's true happiness, he seems a bit controlling and to be honest, he's just plain weird. I don't hate Dan, I would just rather not hang around with him pretending that everything is fine when I know how he feels. I've been avoiding talking to Jess because I don't want to upset her and speak out of turn. What can I do? I fear I'm going to lose my best friend if this continues.

Well her roommate invited over her annoying friend, and this made me really mad. The reason it pissed me off so much is because the roommate's friend can be really annoying and loud at times and I asked (demanded?) Renee if I come over for the weekend, that he won't be there. I told her I rather not come at all versus dealing with the roommates' friend. She promised he won't be there and that is wasn't an issue.


Well, as I was literally about to leave to go down there, I get a message that the roommate invited the annoying friend over, for the entire weekend. Renee didn't say a word to the roommate before hand, so she didn't know. It sucked because I did decide to not come, and it honestly ruined my weekend and I was now pissed off instead of relaxed.


Fast-forward about a week, and we haven't talked to each other at all. She messages me and invites me out for drinks, just her and I. I made a joke about how the annoying friend will probably be there and she took me serious, I guess. We had plans the following day (Friday) to hang out, and she insisted that I just stay home because I sounded like I was in a bad mood and she wouldn't accept me saying I was fine. It went on for about 10 minutes over texts. This in return actually really pissed me off. Thus, me cancelling the plans, again.

She noticed a few days later, and she tried talking to me. I was very reserved and made sure I wasn't rude to her, but I deep down had no real passion to actually work it out with her. She was very apologetic and I feel she was sincere, but I still felt very hurt. Well right now, my issue is that I don't know how to feel. She knew that between projects, work, my internship, and school, that I won't be able hang out with anyone and my break was my last real chance to relax and have fun over the next 8 months. So I feel even more hurt because we planned my entire break around hanging out, and she cancelled everything. I feel like she ruined my entire break because I don't have money to go out and we were just going to hang out, play games, watch movies, etc.


My thing right now is that I don't know what I need to do to fix this or if I should, atleast right now. I am very much a person who is about quality with friends, so I don't have my friends, mainly acquaintances.

Backstory: About a year ago a guy(in this story named Frankie) from a biweekly local stage production added me on facebook, i accepted, and forgot about it. A few months later, we began messaging and became friends. Our friendship grew pretty quickly, and I began to consider him a very very close friend. I confided in him about many things, and he confided in me about many things. We had established a pretty good fwb situation as well and despite having feelings for each other were realistic about it not being an option in the long run to begin an actual relationship. He also told me about how he is a schizophrenic with multiple personality disorder. Despite his actual age, he explained to me, his #1 personality was locked away for almost 2 decades when personality #2 manifested in his mid teens(only being let out when they were on stage or performing elsewhere because #2 got tired of playing the roles), until he was in his thirties. He explained to me that, because of this, when the two finally started getting along and cohabiting more peacefully, he explained that both personalities were in their 20s(after meeting him, you would agree, he also looks to be about 28-29 at the very oldest).

After a time, my work schedule picked up, and the drives out to his place were just not working together(he did not live local to the biweekly production). We've talked a bit over the past couple months, but not much. His texts were always short, though about once a month I would receive a text asking to come hang out again. With his busy schedule, and me working 2 different jobs, it just wasn't possible. The last time I saw him, there were no problems and we had a blast hanging out. 

He also is in the process of having a pair of twins with a long time best friend of his. They are platonic, did it through in vitro fertilization. They both were getting older, had not found someone to have kids with, and agreed to raise them together yet as friends. It's a weird situation that takes knowing him to understand fully and a much longer explanation. He is also a very busy guy who has a career in entertainment and a side business. He is not the type of guy you would even guess is over 30 both in personality, maturity, and looks.

Today though, I texted him because I missed him and our conversations and it blew up really quickly on his end. I handled it with what I thought was awesome communication skills that I've been picking up in therapy and other resources, but he still kept coming at me. Below is a recap of the texts. Am I out of line? Was there a better way for me to handle this? What's the best way for me to respond? My end goal is to solve our communication problems and hang out as we did before.

Me: Wait what? I wasn't trying to be rude at all. I'm sorry if that's the way I came across. I was explaining why I wanted to hear more. I enjoy talking to you, and your short answers were making it hard to continue a conversation. Do you not want to talk to me? Are you too busy for a conversation right now? I feel confused as to how this escalated to so quickly. If I came across as too pushy also I apologize, though I can see how you felt that way. My desire to talk to you combined with the short answers led me to ask more questions. 

Frankie: Ok

Me: Can you see that it can be discouraging for me and frustrating a bit when I receive consistently short answers? If you told me you were too busy to text much I wouldn't try to continue the conversation. Would it be better for me to call you instead when I want to talk to you if texting just isn't your thing? The reason I haven't called is because I know you don't usually have the time to commit that attention to something since you do so much throughout the day. But if that's a wrong assumption, correct me. 

Frankie: You have a very different way of communicating. I feel entitled to information that doesn't even exist. I answered your questions. And i told you what was new. Why do you make everything so fucking dramatic. Stop assuming things. Your logic is NOTHING like mine.

Me: I'm not trying to be dramatic, and I don't feel I am being dramatic. I'm trying to have an adult conversation to identify why I received such a dramatic and aggressive response out of the blue, and how we can work together to find a solution to fix our communication problem. I know our logic is different, we're very different people. Which is why in the last texts I've asked questions to help me understand your logic behind these reactions. I'm not trying to blame you or attack you. What do you mean by you feel entitled to information that doesn't even exist?

Frankie: I stopped talking to you because of the way you act like a child with everything. Try listening to what people say. Or continue to live in your own little world that I find immature and a bit insulting

Frankie: Every time I communicate with you...you annoy me. But I keep trying.

Frankie: Wow, Same circle of questions Why don't you read what i already wrote.

Frankie: You expect there to be more to tell when I started the conversation by telling you what you asked AFTER I HAD ALREADY ANSWERED YOU. Hello?

End conversation. 

Our last several conversations haven't been hostile at all, our communication problem is that I assume things, then ask if I'm correct and explain why I assumed it, then he gets pissed off that I'm assuming anything in the first place. I'm also a bit socially awkward in reading other people, I explain things way too much, and generally think into things too much.

**My story**

For the last give or take 6 years I lived away from my hometown, around 2H flight by plane. I originally moved for studies, stayed for career. Now this is the type of creative career (design) where it’s very difficult to get a job afterwards. I got my head down and focused very hard on my studies and was able to land a dream job in my field straight out of school, one of the top 25 jobs in the country. In the meantime I had acquired a very good social network around me with friends that I now really miss. 


As a person I am very ambitious and career driven, and I would like to live a life with design in one of the mayor European cities within the field. I think and breathe design every moment possible, and would love to able to teach it later in my career. My flaws include anxiousness, darkness, pessimism, conflict shy and difficulties speaking up for myself. Nothing out of the ordinary, but I am aware of these flaws and I am trying to work on them as best as I can. I hope to be able to find a partner one day that is equally into a creative profession as I am, have kids and a studio where we both work together as a team towards building a future.

 .

**Context**

Coming on to now 4 years ago my mother was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer’s disease. The disease has progressed slowly, but she is now at a point where she can’t live without help in my opinion. To state roughly, she has now problems making herself food, can’t keep a clean home and hygienically suffers. She does not believe/understand the full extent of her illness. As is normal with the disease, some days are better than others. It ebb and flows on a declining curve. Earlier years on this curve she mostly has been able to take care of herself with help from my sister, and I found it possible for me to be visiting her 4-5 days a month whilst working full time in the bigger city. Other than the diagnostic process we have not reached out for help from doctors, goal being that the family will care for her as best be until there is no other choice. 

Since 1st of september last year me in conjunction with my family decided it would be the best if I quit my job and moved back. I have since then been living with her and taking the majority of the care for her. In a typical day, I make her breakfast, lunch, dinner, I shop, brush her teeth, tidy up the home and make sure she is clean. I also work full time (since March), so needless to say I don’t have time to do much else, and sometimes I don’t have the energy to do all my duties (mainly tidying/maintance in the home). Every other weekend my mother spends with her boyfriend[60m] (of ~five years), and they travel for about a month in total each year. Mom eats dinners at my sisters place maybe 1-2 times a week, and she sometimes shower there and changes clothes during this time.  We are in the process of getting help from the medical system, but things take time and I find it very difficult to take these battles. The doctors tells us she may have 1–20 years left living with this disease. We currently have no help from the outside.

My mother and father split up back in ’99 after he cheated on her. My father has 5 kids in total with 4 different mothers, I am the last in the family line (as far as I know). After the divorce I stayed with my mother, my sister stayed with my father - though we only lived like 500m apart. I moved out roughly around 2008, and Mom has lived alone since then. She got a boyfriend 1 year before the diagnosis, and I have to commend him for staying put.  I don’t think I can expect him to do more than what he does at this time. My mother is really the sweetest person I know, and seeing her in this current state is killing me. She has always been the source of knowledge to me, the person I always could talk to about everything. Losing this and having to find your own footing in life, knowing that there are no one else is tough. She is now very far away from the person she was, and akin to a human shell inhibited by a different entity - even though she still has her soul in there. 

.

**Issues**

I am in conflict on how to deal with my mothers disease, her needs and future, what I want for my own future, and what my family members expect of me. This fosters a lot of issues.


Ideally I want to get mom help and within a system that is more able to take care of her than I am at this point. I want to stay here and see it through, and then move from this town again when the system is well in place and an integral part of her life. The medical services in my country is one of the best in the world, and I really do think that she would benefit from having qualified help now. Is this a crazy thought or priority of me?


My sister does not consider my field of work to be much, and has on one occasion gloated my vocation as unimportant to society. (she is a lawyer.) She has point blank told me that she will never forgive me if I ever choose to move away before my mother is dead. Considering how much I value what I do this has hurt me quite a lot. My father doesn’t get what I do, but seems appreciative of my achievements. I think of us in the family as very different people, and I feel like I try hard to find equal footing where we can enjoy something together. For instance I’m not really that into football, but I do go over to my father’s once a week to watch some with him. I feel like I can talk to him about some things, and I’m glad for that.


Time and time again there will be drama and conflict in the family. I mostly try to keep to myself and try to stay out of it, but it seems like I get dragged into stuff that I really do not know how to handle. For instance, the latest (emblematic) conflict happened when my sister had my mother over for dinner. My sister also lives in the near vicinity (250m), and about once or twice a week picks mom up for dinner. She had my mother walk home by herself after this dinner. I relished having some time off after work, and went to say hello to my father in the meantime. My sister called me some hours into my stay and yelled at me for locking the front door to the house when I went out, saying that my mother had been standing outside the door unable to unlock it for an hour. Mom has been having trouble unlocking the door for some time, but on this occasion my sister didn’t make sure mom had the key with her when she went to pick her up. I think it’s ridiculous that I get the blame for issues like this - from my point of view I came home from work to an empty home, had a quick snack and went out again, naturally locking the door because all our valuables are in the house. From my point of view is that when my sister have my mom over, mom is her responsibility. We disagree on this point. I perceive problems like this to be a recurring occurrence, and now we haven’t spoken in close to a month. I briefly met her at a concert last week, and she came over and whispered sorry. I told her to not worry about it. I heard from my father today however that my sister is waiting for me to apologise back(?) and is mad at me for not doing so. It’s common that the rest of my family (excluding mom) talks between themselves and around each others backs. I hate that shit, and one of the benefits of not living in my hometown past 6 years is not having to deal with drama like that. 


It’s been now 8 months since I moved back to my hometown. It has ~70k people living here. I have got a job here now within my field (nothing spectacular and no future prospect - but it’s money), I feel constantly exhausted, not inspired, and I’m struggling with having a will to live any more. I harbour feelings of apathy/hopelessness, and on the bad days I feel like it’s not possible to turn this life around and that this is forever. Quitting, and essentially leaving my life behind to come back has been tough. I meet up with childhood friends once every two weeks, they are all nice people but I don’t really feel like I connect with anyone up here. I mostly deal with this in solace. I have turned down one relationship and one other potential partner (long distance, no energy) because of my situation -  and I do feel like my dreams are currently running out in the sand. The problem is that Alzheimer's is a very unpredictable disease - I don’t really have a time limit for when things should be progressing and when mom will get help and eventually be taken care of by others. This adds a huge amount of pressure and colors my relation to everything - I feel like I need a light out there in the end of the tunnel in order to focus, a goal to work towards, but there is none currently. I am breaching on despair around my everyday life. I want to feel happy about being here and taking care of mom, but I’m not able to. I feel guilty a lot. I feel like my relation to my sister is on a straight track to hell, and that I ultimately have to choose between making the rest of my family happy and what I want to do in life. 


How should my priorities between my family’s needs and mine be? What would you do in my situation? Any help is appreciated. Thank you for reading, I had to get this off my chest and I want to seek professional help as soon as possible.

I've been living with my roommates for a few months now and everything's been fine so far. We've been on good terms for the most part but there's one gradually developing problem. One roommate, Alex, owns a puppy named Brutus that he hasn't been taking good care of. He rescued him from the streets a few months before we all moved in together.


Alex never registered the dog with the apartment office, so they don't know he is living here too. His kennel is in Alex's bedroom and me and my two other roommates like dogs so we were cool with him being there at first. I've gotten more and more upset with how he's being treated though. Alex barely buys her any toys or treats, he isn't training her or giving her any attention. He's also been going home most weekends and leaving his dog for us to take care of. Brutus is in his crate pretty much all day except when he needs to go to the bathroom. Brutus is a super sweet and smart dog, and I really like him a lot. However, I honestly think he's starting to have health and behavior problems because of his terrible owner.


I've been trying to give Alex hints on being a good owner, but he hasn't been picking up on it. I give Brutus some time out of his crate when I can with walks and whatnot, but it isn't often because I'm usually pretty busy with school and work. I've also bought him bones and treats unlike Alex. I even made attempts to start training him in my free time. I taught him how to sit in like five minutes and some other basic stuff, while Alex has no idea what he's doing. Me and my other roommates have discussed it and thought of some solutions and agree that something needs to be done but we're not sure what to do.

25548,Non-Romantic,1yk4lp,"I am just so frustrated, I just need to vent my thoughts.  

For a little background (I am leaving a lot out): All my life, my parents have been financial irresponsible. My father is an alcoholic who was and still is emotionally abusive to my mother. He was also emotionally abusive to me during my teenage years until I moved out and decided I wasn’t going to be afraid of him anymore. Growing up, my mother would always confide in me on everything that was happening with her marriage and their financial situation. As you can imagine, this was a little too much to take being a young girl but I supported my mom as much as I could emotionally. I have two younger brothers that are now in their mid-20s. My parents have always doted on them, partly because they are boys (a cultural thing). I love and fully support my brothers, through my only issue with them is that they are afraid to stand up to my parents. They rather just ignore the situation and not deal with the drama that comes from having to deal with them. Frankly, I don’t blame them since growing up they were never really exposed to my parents’ financial problems or my mother’s emotional drama. However, I feel like someone has to speak up against their behavior..since no one else wants to do it, it has to be me. This has not helped my relationship with my parents. They think I am very selfish even though I have given them full emotional support as well as thousands of dollars in the past to help solve one of their many finical crises. 

Now to the current situation: my parents are heavily in debt, are in the process of being foreclosed on and, do not have a lot money in savings. Their “plan” (I say this loosely since they do not typically think about or plan for the future) is to work until the house gets repossessed  then move in with my brothers who currently live together in the same city I live in. However, my brothers do not want to live with them, and plan to help get my parents their own apartment. My parents don’t know about this yet but I know when they find out they will be very upset and hurt. (They are very good at guilt tripping us.)

It has been bad enough having to deal with them while they live hundreds of miles away but I feel like things will be even worse if they move closer. I have been dealing with their problems my whole life and frankly I am tired of it. My husband knows that I get visibly stressed out and upset even thinking/talking about them. I can’t imagine having to deal with them if they move to the same city as us. I would love to cut all contact with them but I know if I do that it would be hard on my brothers. I know my parents will give them a lot of grief over it.  

I know it sounds immature but I just don’t want to deal with them or their drama anymore. They feel like burden that I want no part of especially since I now have my own life and family I am responsible for.

* Sister-in-law (Betty) has Borderline Personality Disorder
* Betty and my sister (Gail) became close and were pretty good friends for awhile
* Betty borrowed money from Gail earlier this year (Over 1k) and then was pretty rude to her. Gail decided she did not want to be friends with Betty (Gail has always been like that) any longer so stopped speaking to her beyond being polite.
* Both parties refuse to talk to the other person about it and do not want to reconcile.
* Betty badmouths Gail to me and Gail never has anything (bad or good) to say about Betty, and doesn't really care.


**The situation today:**



Christmas presents. Gail decide this year to give two gifts to all of Betty's family (for everyone gifts) including my brother and their multiple children. I don't really see anything wrong with that as we only receive one gift from their family for birthdays and Christmas, and she did a good job picking them out. On our way out the door Betty was being very rude to Gail (being overly, fake nice with a mad look on her face.) After everyone separated I had a message from Betty saying that Gail was being a vile cunt because she did not get Betty a Christmas gift, nor has Gail apologized/tried to rekindle the friendship. I informed her that the gifts Gail brought were for everyone, and she said that Gail did not tell anyone that. I was there and I heard Gail say, at least once, that the gifts were for everyone. I mentioned that to Betty and I haven't heard back from her since.



The real issue is there's a family gathering tonight and tomorrow and I'm honestly really, really pissed that she said that about Gail. IT was VERY uncalled for even if Gail had not gotten her a gift. I'm concerned that she's going to continue to be rude and I will not tolerate it. No one else in my family will say anything to her (Gail doesn't really care) even though everyone mentioned that it was really uncomfortable. I want to say something to her, but I'm not sure what or how I can say it without being mean. Any advice or ideas on the best way to deal with this situation? Should I just totally stay out of it, and tell her I don't want to hear anything about Gail?

My father has joked with all four of his kids that we should just marry our significant others to save on tuition. He makes six figures in most years, but like a lot of people, the EFC on the FAFSA is completely inaccurate and he's had to put three of us thru college, including one kid who went to private military school for high school and then went to state school. I was the last kid.

In June of last year, I left the house. My father has extreme anger problems, and the screaming and fighting left me pretty emotionally scarred. I also struggle with PTSD with causes both related and not related to the dysfunctional household. So the best thing psychologically was for me.

What happened next was both planned and not. I had talked to my boyfriend extensively about the idea of marrying platonically to maximize the financial aid we'd receive from the government. Well, in that first very emotional week where I struggled to see a way to pay for the university I would attend in the fall, we got married. 

Very recently, my father and I have reconnected, and we're working on our problems together in an environment where I feel safe. I'm very very happy to have my family back, in a way that isn't detrimental to my health. But...I'm terrified of telling him. How do I explain to him that my boyfriend and I DO see the marriage as simply a financial agreement and NOT a bounded for life contract? Do I tell him while my boyfriend is there so he can talk to us both? Do I tell him on my own so he can feel more comfortable and less attacked in a sense? Help!

By the way, the reason I absolutely have to tell him is because he'll want to fill out the FAFSA soon, and I'll need some way to explain to him how I magically became independent, because I certainly don't a child and time didn't magically spring forward.

She just woke up one day and just said she couldn't take it anymore and just ended things with him. With that happening, the house was shaken by this big news since they were together for about 6 years. They've broken up on and off before, though this time its permanent. I somehow got dragged into this situation, since I've broken up with my bf once or twice before. I've been in a relationship with my boyfriend for about 3+ years now, and it's been an LDR for the entire time. He's visited me twice, both times staying for about a month. When we broke up, it happened shortly after he left to go home, which I take some blame for because I do have some mistakes. However, my parents saw it as his fault, like most parents would during break ups.

My grandmother spoke to my father about my sister and her ex today, and she loves to twist things. It's probably not her fault since she has a bad memory, but apparently she told my father that my sister's ex was a gambler and my sister had to pay his debts. That was **100% NOT TRUE**. The real truth was that my sister has been paying for food/cloths/daily stuff etc for her bf, when he doesn't pay for almost anything, and he was planning on playing the stock markets, which is like legal gambling.

**My Situation**

So for some reason she decided to mention my circumstance and told my father my bf is coming. My father got mad and scolded me, saying things like When did I say he can come and stay over?!, If he's coming I'm not giving you a single cent to spend!. It really upset me to the point where I felt my breathing stop for a while and almost blacked out. He's said very hurtful things like Why are my daughters so stupid when it comes to men!.

By the way, he did say it was fine for him to stay a while back (start of February). I also asked my grandmother and she said it was fine for him to stay (We all live together, house is owned by my grandparents, but we stay in my parents house on the weekends).

It's really hurtful when he says such things, and I have no idea how to talk to him. He's not the type to listen when he gets mad. I feel so frustrated and angry right now. I'm not very good at arguing either since I can either say extremely hurtful things or just breakdown (or both).

It happened an hour ago. I was annoyed at my brother for leaving random articles of clothing around our parent's living room. That, coupled with the fact that I feel he does little housework and contributes to most of the messes, I snapped. I threw a sock, a SOCK, mind you, at him from a few feet away and chastised him for being messy. 

He responded by forcefully  choking me, dragging me/throwing me to where the sock lay, and demanding I pick it up.

Now that I'm back home from college, I forgot how much we actually dislike each other. The first time, I called him out on using our mom to beg me to help me write his cover letter. He chased me up the stairs, and tried to ram my door down once I managed to scurry to the room's safety. He howled for minutes about how he was going to beat my face in. 

Today was the first time he got that chance, apparently. I never once acted physically violent towards him in these altercations. But It didn't hurt me that he took advantage of his physical size to throw me around, or that he later mocks my past experiences suffering through suicidal tendencies. No, what really hurts me is my parents reaction; which is when I actually started crying. He knows they'll take his side, so he's the first to call them while they're on vacation. He openly admits to them he hurt me, then hands me the phone so my parents can talk some sense into me, as I begin threatening to call the cops. 

My parents reaction basically boils down to we'll figure it out when we get home, stay put. You're siblings, you're bound to fight. You need to calm down. What did you do to provoke him? I got very upset that they basically brushed it off and started trying to guilt trip me for giving them a hard time while they're on vacation. And the second I said, screw it, I'll stay at my friend's house until you're back from vacation, my dad ordered me to stay home and accused me of acting like a child.

I'll always be a child to them. I'm disregarding their orders and going to spend the night at a friend's. It will probably create some major backlash against me, but I'm done listening to my brother snicker at me when I try to make a case against him to my parents (literally happened as he held the phone on speaker.) I feel as if he gets preference for being the only son amongst three other daughters in an asian household. But I digress.

I've changed my age, the time we've been together, and a few other things as my boyfriend frequents this subreddit.



I've been with my current boyfriend for a year. It's been great - we communicate openly and talk about anything that we have a problem with. He lives with his family, and I live with mine.



My boyfriend has a very troubled family - they are currently going through a divorce...I think. It seems to be a slow process - I can understand that it's tiring, as I've seen some of my other friends and family go through a divorce.



The problem is that my boyfriends father isn't exactly a rolemodel dad - he seems to be a real prick, constantly pissed off, negative, and the one thing that really bothers me - screaming at his mom all the time. There are a few times I have seen him storm out of the house, or I have been there waiting for my boyfriend, and all I hear is yelling, blaming her for something that isn't her fault (he dropped a dish, blamed her even though he never asked for help with carrying it), and being generally rude to her.


She isn't perfect either - hence the divorce, but why does she need to be treated like this?



Reddit, I am not sure where I stand on this matter or what I can do. This absolutely disgusts me and the fact that my boyfriend won't stand up for her or anything is driving me up the wall. She's incredibly supportive of him and anything he does, constantly looking out for him...I don't get it.



TL;DR: My boyfriends father screams at his mom, says incredibly vulgar things. Completely against my morals and values.

25614,Non-Romantic,2gtmm7,"After getting out of a relationship that lasted 2 years, I immediately jumped into what I was hoping to be just an NSA physical relationship with a friend of nearly 4 years, which turned into an actual relationship. 
I told them from the beginning I didn't wanna make them rebound action because of my hurt feelings so I didn't want them to get the wrong idea. 

Backstory: I was with someone for nearly 2 years until I was dumped for someone else, no joke. While I maintained a good face for a while, I finally broke down to my close friend that I was feeling pretty worthless. A little overdramatic, yes, but it was the longest relationship I had ever been in, we talked about getting married and having kids and my dad was even for it. Then to just get dumped and essentially replaced made me feel pretty awful. 
He sympathized and comforted me, and we proceeded to share stories of our ex's, and eventually grew closer until we started getting physical. 
As I said, I warned him that I didn't want to hurt him or anything, we both kinda agreed that sex would be nice, just casual sex. 

But of course, it ended up blossoming into what I thought was an awesome relationship, only until I opened my eyes a month or two later and realized what a complete fucking psycho he was.

Without getting into too much detail, he cut himself in front of me, he pushed me beyond what I thought was my anger limit, he would constantly check my texts and facebook email, and was this completely different person behind closed doors. 
We only dated a few months, but he already talked about marriage and having kids, and I'm pretty sure tried to get me pregnant. 

Not to mention that he sexually assaulted me in my sleep a few times. 

I didn't leave because I was honestly terrified. He was one of my close friends for a good 4 years and we had a good handful of close mutual friends between us. I only really told one friend what happened but I don't think he believed me. I didn't really tell anyone because I was scared. After a physical fight in which he threw my phone under the couch when I called for help and pinned me down until I bit him on his chest, I said this is bullshit and left town. 

Unfortunately, it didn't happen that quickly. after a week of being a shut in, not talking to nobody or even making eye contact with my own mother, I forgave him and took him back because somehow, he made me feel like a monster. After another month of agony, I finally got the balls to gather a handful of things and head home to my family. 
I left my dog, my mother, and a lot of belongings that I'll probably never see again. 
I tried to be friends with him for a little bit before finally breaking things off. In my haste to leave, I left him with some clothes, my prized comics, and my video game consoles. I'm probably not gonna see those again either. 

After a while, my mom finally started talking to me and I told her what happened, my dog is with a loving family that gives her more than I ever could, and I'm with my family. 

The only problem is now, half of who I thought were my closest friends won't talk to me. A girl I thought was even my best friend started dating him. She deleted me off facebook and I blocked the both of them. 
It just.. makes me feel defeated. Like he won. 
I want my friends back, but at the same time, were they really my friends? These were my 'true' friends that I knew for 6+ years. I entrusted these people with my life but now I'm lucky if I get a text back from them. 
I wanna tell them what happened but I feel like it would be a wasted effort. 

Do I just move on and find some new friends? Do I expel the truth? I'm at a loss here. I'm an idiot for not leaving sooner and jumping into something right after a long relationship.

25651,Non-Romantic,3i1mc7,"I live at home and I'm an only child. I go to college, work at a computer shop and occasionally as a freelance web developer when I get clients. I did alright in high school (3.5 GPA), played sports for 2 years and just a little disrespectful at times to my parents back then. I consider myself a good kid.


Now, lets just dive right in. I don't understand my mother sometimes. My mom is a stay-at-home mom, her reasons being to take care of my grandma, yet my aunt already lives her to help her around. Whatever, I can understand taking care of my grandma, but now becoming a stay-at-home-mom, you have to do your duty as one. She does this many times, but this one really pissed me off.


I wake up at 6am to go to school, go to work, then come home around 5pm. Then I do my own laundry, feed the dogs, take out the trash, etc. (the standard chores without a problem) and work out then I'm done around 7ish. I had a client contact me last week about a website that needed to be done tonight, and I've been working on that for the past couple of days. I was almost done with what I had to do when my mom comes in screaming at me for not finishing my job. I asked her calmly what I didn't do and I just completely forgot to put the stupid trash can liner on. So, I put it back on, go back to my room and my mouse, and all my game remotes are gone. (BTW she still takes away my fucking mouse, WiiU and GameCube remotes like a 5 year old).


Now, calmly, I tell her to give me back at least my mouse because I was working on a website for a client and she responds with the don't give me that tone bullshit. (I still can't believe she treats me like that when I'm fucking 18!). So, being a bit angrier, I tell her, I need my mouse that I paid for with my own money with the job I have because my client needs the website done TONIGHT. Then, she tells me she'll give it back after I water the plants, clean the floors with the Swiffer, do my parents own laundry and rake the leaves and pull the weeds out back tomorrow morning(basically all her shit she does as a stay-at-home-mom). So, I did the shit she told me to do and I asked her for my mouse back (mind you while I'm asking her this, she's lying down watching TV). She then says no because I was disrespectful to her. After 15 minutes of explaining why I need my god damn mouse back because of my job and if I do well, my client could recommend me to other people, therefore giving me more work which equals money, she still says no.


So, I called my dad who was away at work and told him the whole situation. My dad works really hard and he's really proud of me being a freelance web developer. My dad is the person who just listens to my mom and just follows her orders (most of the time). He ended up telling my mom to give me the mouse back, but she still didn't for my attitude.


(Now, I consider myself a VERY laid back, chill guy, but I completely lost my shit because her taking my stuff, then me doing all her work has been going on for YEARS.)
I basically spewed out my mind and honestly I don't remember some of the stuff I said because I was releasing all this pent up rage I had for years. The last thing I remember is calling her a bitch (I lost my mind and I apologized) and slamming my door.
The next morning, I just apologized to my mom and did all of the fucking chores and housework. Then, politely, I asked her if I could have my mouse back. She then replied, See, wasn't so hard after all. while laying the fuck down on the couch.


I hop back on my computer and my client dropped me. I just walked out of the house (I was too pissed off and didn't want to spill out my mind again), took my dog, and my PC. I'm at a friend's place right now until my dad gets home in a couple of days. I didn't answer any of my mom's texts or calls, but I explained everything to my dad. I'm just so frustrated right now and can't stand my mom.


Her taking my stuff for no reason, and making me do a bunch of work around the house for years has been going on for too long and isn't the only stuff she has done. She uses her stay-at-home-mom bullshit as an excuse of her doing something as work. The only thing she has done in the past week was do the dishes twice (all she has to do is put it in the damn dishwasher), hose of the patios, and clean the master bedroom. She has also crushed my dreams of being a game designer and had the mind to ask me why I don't want to major as one. She used to talk bad about my crush's and gf's to my grandma and aunt. This is why I can't even bring my lady friend over to my house. She's half vietnamese and half white. My mom and my aunt talked smack about her just because she was vietnamese to my face. My dad on the other hand supports me. My mom is also a fucking hypocrite. I could just go on and on, but if I did I would post that to /r/offmychest[1] . She can be nice sometimes and some days totally flip.


I honestly don't know what to do in this situation. I really want to move out, but apartments in California are so expensive. I can only stay a certain amount of days at my friends apartment before I have to go somewhere else, but my dad will be home in time. The friend that I'm staying at's mom will be moving out, so I might consider moving in with him if this shit doesn't stop.


I don't know what to do, looking at my mom just frustrates me right now. Oh and she still has my fucking WiiU and GameCube remotes.

25687,Non-Romantic,2lytgl,"My 11 year-old cousin recently turned 11.  My aunt held a party at a pizza place, and it was not great:

First, the party package allowed the birthday child and up to 25 other people.  12 of them were family.  One was my cousin's best friend.  The other 12 were adult friends of my aunt, some of which my cousin has never met.

My cousin was visibly annoyed when a few of these people showed up.  She said she doesn't like them and didn't know her mom invited them.  She said they're rude and loud, and throughout the party I learned that she was right.

The party room consisted of two long rows of tables.  My aunt sat with her friends on one side of the room, and everyone else sat on the other.  My aunt spent most of her time over there instead of with her birthday girl.

Those 12 adult friends did not behave in a child-oriented fashion. Rather than celebrating the 11 year-old's birthday, they seemed to be celebrating 11 years of parenthood  for my aunt. They brought several bottles of alcohol and were taking shots.

Even the food was not really kid-friendly.  The party package came with 6 large pizzas and 6 pitchers of soda.  My aunt's and her friends chose all 6 to be weird varieties - specialties like Hawaiian BBQ, one with hot sauce and several kinds of peppers,  etc.  They did not choose a single kid-friendly pizza for my cousin or the other kids in the family. Even the adults in the family weren't interested in any of the pizzas they ordered.  We called my aunt over and asked her to order some normal pizzas and she said that she could only get 6 with the party package, and couldn't afford to buy any extra on top of it.  She said we should have said something before she ordered - but we didn't even know they had ordered until pizzas came out of the kitchen.

As for the pitchers of soda, they took 5 of the 6 pitchers for their table. Only one came to ours.  1 pitcher was not enough for 12 people.  My grandma went over there to have a chat with my aunt about how this was not really kid-oriented and she wanted my aunt to come to our table and be with her daughter, and she wanted my aunt's friends to stop taking shots in a family restaurant. She was really ashamed of my aunt.

Ultimately I ended up ordering 3 more pizzas and soda for our table because no one wanted any of the weird stuff they got.

When it came time for cake, we also learned that my aunt chose her favorite kind of cake instead of my cousin's, which just seemed sad and weird.  The cake had pineapple in it and my cousin said she has had it before but didn't like it.  She ended up only eating a few bites  of her own birthday cake.

Ultimately I'm sad and disgusted by how everything happened.  My aunt did not treat this as a party for her daughter's 11th birthday, but instead as a party for herself and her friends.

What should be done about this?  I an contemplating throwing a second birthday party for her or something, but I don't know.  I also feel like someone needs to talk to my aunt about this, because it's unacceptable.  Should that be someone talking to her one-on-one, or several people intervention-style?

I would appreciate any advice anyone has.  I really want to stand up for my young cousin on this issue.

At first I liked her, and I keep hoping that she'll stop doing annoying things but it doesn't seem to be getting better. 

The main issue I have is with her drinking. Drunk people make me really uncomfortable, she's constantly drinking. She invades my personal space while drinking- she touches me and tries to kiss me- I'm not a very affectionate person, so this really annoys me. She's also really inconsiderate: last night she passed out at my house after drinking too much then woke me up in the middle of the night and made noise in my house for an hour after I had asked her multiple times to either leave or be quiet. 

I've told my boyfriend that I don't want this girl around anymore, but she still has been coming to my house. Regardless of what I do I'll have to keep dealing with her because we have mutual friends, but I need to figure out how to get her to leave me alone and stop coming to my house in the nicest way possible.

I've tried telling my boyfriend that I don't like her coming around. When I brought up bluntly telling her how I feel, my boyfriend didn't like that idea. So I don't know what else to do. I need to get away from this girl. 

TL;DR I can't stand this girl who keeps showing up in my life. I need to get her to leave me alone, as nicely as possible, to avoid strain on our mutual friendships.

My mother and I have had a lovely relationship all through my childhood. When I around 12, I sort of became a little bit more aware of life (and particularly death) and have been quite an introverted and contemplative soul since then. My mother claims that this was the age I 'changed'. She says that she laments that I was such a different child and I used to be 'sunny' and now constantly describes me as 'miserable'. I am quite dry and concise. What she doesn't know is that I am that way particularly around *her* as I feel like I am constantly walking on eggshells so as not to start a fight. I feel the best way to avoid a fight is to shut down emotionally and be as civil as possible. I admit I am not a particularly demonstrative person, and don't really hug anyone but my SO. She hates the fact that I don't really seek her out for hugs and kisses any more, but I really am trying to change that as I know it's important to her.

Christmas time is always a catalyst for family bust-ups, and I have been dreading it in the run up to the big day. Amazingly, yesterday went fine, there were no major fallouts. So, to Boxing Day. We had a minor dispute before we left the house, but soldiered on and made our way over to our extended family members' tonight for more...festivities. My mother spends the entire evening doing things to antagonize me. Even other family members were asking what the problem was, and they were asking her why she was trying to annoy me. It has to be said that she does this often after a fight but tries to pass it off as 'joking'. When I, in turn, get annoyed, she dismisses me as 'miserable because I can't take a joke', and this will usually lead to an even bigger fight. I said to her Ok, I get it. You're annoyed at me but can you give it a rest now? Queue 'can't take a joke' spiel but we remain civil for a few hours as the drinks flow between other family members, including my mum. (I'm not drinking because I'm driving.)


Few hours later, the conversation turns to our relationship and why mum's been irritating me all night. My aunt (the closest family member to both me and my mother) tries to be the middle ground and speculates as to why we have the problems we do. The conversations starts to descend into a shouting match, particularly between my my aunt and mum, as my mother feels she is being 'attacked'. Even my aunt says that resolving issues is impossible because she won't let me talk without throwing some kind of verbal barb at me. Mum becomes increasingly belligerent and starts to say things like Everyone talks to me the way they want to including, xmas-cheer. Everyone does whatever they want to me. At this point I've had enough, and say I'm not dealing with this, and get up to go upstairs. She shouts as I leave, Yeah, that's right you can't deal with it. Were you raped at 8?! You don't care about anyone!


I cannot express how heartbroken I am that she threw this into the conversation. I have never been anything but sympathetic to what happened to her and have **never** judged her for it. At this point, my aunt completely blows her lid, and starts screaming and crying at my mother. I am upstairs crying and my aunt comes up a few minutes later to hug me. My aunt goes back down and all I hear is shouting:


&gt;What you did is disgusting and you are ruining your relationship with her. She is your child! How dare you put that on her - you had no right to throw that in her face! You have made her feel as if what happened to you is something to do with her. She is upstairs crying, and you need to go and fix it. If you leave you will lose her. You are being a bitch. 


&gt;Okay, I'm a bitch then. Clearly, I'm a slut too. A slut that was raped at 8!


I cover my ears after this as I do not want to hear any more. I go downstairs to get my shoes on and drive home. My aunt is trying to stop my mother from leaving but she is still shouting at everyone. I start screaming: 


&gt;What are you doing? You better stop this right now! I don't know what your problem is. 

My mother responds by squaring up to me as if she is going to fight me and saying 
&gt;You don't? Don't you know what my problem is? 

over and over again. My aunt acting as a barricade between us and tells me to go home. My mum left two minutes after I started my car and I saw her walking down the road. I raced home, took all the knives out of the drawer, barricaded my room door and have been in here since. I have never, EVER seen my mother this way. It's like she's had some psychotic break. It's after 2am, we left about 10. She has not come home yet despite it being a 15 minute walk from my aunt's house to ours.  I called her three times, she didn't answer. Now she has turned off her phone/it's died. 


I do not know what to do. I feel a lot of it has to do with the alcohol that was consumed. But, in wine, there is truth, and I am devastated that she would think of me in this way. Maybe she thinks I can never understand 'struggle' because I was not raped?? I know she thinks I am young and naive, but now I think she only thinks that because nobody has been what she's been through, so we can't relate to her on *any* level.  I am worried about the future of our relationship - she is my mother after all. Can our relationship be salvaged?

25692,Non-Romantic,2po2zf,"I have been dating my wonderful girlfriend Christy for three years. I've been friends with Glen for about a year now.

Glen and I have become very good friends and he is honestly one of my best friends. Of course Christy and Glen have met and they both enjoy each other's company. Not surprising since Christy loves everyone and Glen is one of the most easy going people I've ever met.

Glen is very religious. He is also bisexual and has struggled with this. He has trouble connecting with women even though he really likes them and is very attracted to them. Then it won't work out and he will go and hook up with a man for one night as his way of coping.

He then feels a lot of guilt and remorse. He is not out to any of his family and most of his friends because he doesn't want to be disowned. Christy and I are pretty open minded, so we don't judge.

Glen told me he was considering moving to the other side of the country and starting a new life and just being gay. He was in a lot of despair because he has always wanted to get married to a woman and have children with the white picket fence, etc. I've asked him if he might consider just hooking up with girls and dating guys for a change but he immediately rejects the idea. He says he's tried dating guys and he hates it, has no interest in having a relationship with a man beyond a one night stand. He wants a woman for his life partner. But hook ups with women don't work for him because he can't seperate sex and love with women like he can with men. I'm bisexual myself, so I undersand the complexity of human sexuality and where he is coming from.

The point is it's been very painful and draining for him to the point where he is considering cutting ties with his family and giving up his dreams of marriage to move several thousand miles away and be a permanent bachelor who only has casual sex with men.

Then he started dating Lisa. He had told me he started dating someone and he really liked her. Me and Christy were excited for him and I asked him for and update whenever he could give one. Well after they had been dating for 3 months he said he wanted me to meet her (Christy was out of town at the time). So I met her last week and she seemed like a nice enough girl. Glen is clearly infatuated. He has been giving hints that he wants me to give an opinion on her.

Well I was Skyping Christy tonight (we've been long distance for a year because of her job) and she was excidtedly asking about Glen's new girlfriend. So I gave some arbitrary details and then said she was a single mom.

Christy visibly dimmed in enthusiasm and said Oh...how many kids does she have? So I said she had two boys who were 9 and 3 (she didn't bring them to our meet up, Glen has told me) 

Christy asked if she had been married and how recently was she out of the relationship. I said at least once and, well, she had been out of her marriage for less than a year. I wasn't even sure if the divorce was final.

Christy was starting to get obviously upset by this point.

She then asked about the bio dad's involvement. I said the first one's dad was out of the picture and the three year old's had a restraining order for two years because he was physically abusive and unstable.

It was at this point Christy...well she didn't lose her shit but she wasn't her typical laid back self either. She almost came through the screen and said Wait....WHAT?

I asked what the problem was and she said *Name* are you KIDDING ME? And you've been SUPPORTING him to stay WITH this girl???

At this point I was pretty bewildered by her reaction. But honestly, I can be pretty dense in social situations and have been taken advantage of a lot by several people because, well, I have very poor judgement.

Christy rolled her eyes and said *Name*, this woman has not one but TWO baby daddy's already. One is a deadbeat and the other IS PSYCHOTIC AND VIOLENT. And she hasn't even been out of the marriage a full year and doesn't even have a finalized divorce?!?! *Name*  this is **dangerous** for Glen! Her ex could easily lose his shit and hurt him if he already has a history of violence and erratic behavior! What are you both thinking!?!?

It was at this point I felt my jaw dropping. None of this had ever really occured to me before.

She regained some composure and said You need to tell Glen to drop her like a hot rock. Like yesterday. This woman is a walking train wreck and basket case.

I said that I hadn't seen Glen this happy in forever and was that really necessary?

Christy said Glen is happy because this woman is being sweet as pie and giving him the female attention he craves. He's a total sweetheart and a sucker for a sob story. He probably sees himself as this bitch's savior. She's probably on the prowl for someone who is emotionally vulnerable like him so she has her next meal ticket and provider.

She then said Look, in MY opinion this is what you should tell him. I'll stay out of it, and you both can make your own decisions. But at the LEAST tell Glen to ALWAYS use a condom that HE brings if he's with her. Don't listen to her if she says she's on the pill or whatever, because she clearly doesn't know how to use birth control or make good decisions.

The last thing she said about the subject before we switched topics was shaking her head in disgust and saying Jesus, Glen deserves so much better than this.

By this point I was pretty surprised. Christy is honestly peaches and cream, sweetness and light. One of the most unjudgemental people I have ever met, it's one of the reasons I fell in love with her. Rich or poor, black or white, straight or gay, man or woman, adult or child, Christy loves and helps everyone. This type of behavior is very rare from her (where she gets aggressive and declares a person must be avoided)

But I'm so happy for my friend Glen that he might have found someone. I really want to support him and this relationship, and his girlfriend did seem so nice it never occured to me she could be like that. (Of course I said the same about my ex wife....)

Here are my reasons where I'm thinking Christy might be jumping the gun and being a little judgemental and harsh:

1. She's very protective of people she cares about and if she thinks someone could hurt them in anyway she can turn into the figurative mama bear. I think her love and loyalty for Glen may be getting in the way here

2. Christy has had horrible experiences with my ex wife and she may be projecting. I was a single dad and told Christy my ex and I were amicable, because Christy told me she would not date me if there was any baby mama drama. Well my ex completely lost her shit and things got so bad Christy and I had to threaten her with a restraining order, and she still continues to cause problems for us to this day. This has caused a strain between Christy and I because she thinks I either purposely decieved her about how bad things were or I was being deluded and didn't want to admit things were awful. (It's the 2nd, I didn't think, or want to admit, the mother of my kids is a psychotic bitch) and although I am so sorry for the things that have happened, I think Christy has become a bit jaded and wary of single moms and ex wives. (And after all the shit that went down, I can't really blame her if she did).

3. Christy herself admitted she can't pass full judgement because she hasn't met the woman in person, and would have to meet her before she can make any final decisions. But she also said that regardless a smart man wouldn't bet money on the gf.

But here are my reasons for why I think Christy might have a good point:

1. Although Christy is a sweetheart and very unjudgemental, she grew up in a bad and abusive family. Lots of abuse and lying and emotional manipulation, gas lighting, you name it. Not to mention she saw it in most of her friends families. As a result, even though she'll give you the shirt off her back, she also has a zero bullshit tolerance policy and  can smell a con or deception a mile away, because she knows exactly what it looks like. And if you dare try to do it to her or anyone she loves, may the gods have pity on you because she won't.

2. I guess this is kind of a subset of point one but, unlike me, Christy is amazing at reading social situations and has almost perfect judgement of character. She almost has this...sixth sense with people. She will call out people for having a broken moral compass and I'll see nothing wrong with them. Or I'll say someone looks shady and Christy will say that they are a really decent person. And 99 times out of 100, Christy was RIGHT. I've really come to trust her judgement, she has helped me weed out toxic and destructive people out of my life and helped me form rich and rewarding friendships with people like I've never had in my life. It is RARE for her to take an immediate dislike to someone. If she does, there always ends up something being terribly wrong with the person, like they are a sociopath or child molester or narcissist. So it makes me wonder if she's not right here as well.

3. I don't know if she has a thing against single parents becuase she's always good and genuine with them, and I'M a single parent. She's fantastic with my kids too, they love her to death. If she had a bias against single parents I think it would have made itself obvious by now and I certainly don't think she'd date me.

So now I'm debating on what to tell Glen. Christy's arguments logically do make a lot of sense the more I think about them but I don't want to destroy the happiness Glen has found. I am also being stubborn and thinking maybe Christy is wrong and not being fair. I liked her. (But...again...I liked a lot of toxic and abusive people including my ex wife). I'm a hard core optomist so it's hard for me to admit or see any negatives.

So which one of us is right here? Does Christy have a point? And regardless, what on earth do I tell Glen?

**TL;DR My good friend met someone and is happy for the first time in forever. My girlfriend who has excellent judge of character and is typically welcoming and kind to everyone says this woman is toxic. Who is right and what do I tell my buddy?**

25701,Non-Romantic,2rwdwn,"Ok so I'll start at the beginning(ish.) I've had a pretty long history with this girl (lets call her Sara), I'd known her for about 6 years of my life so we went pretty far back. Let me start off by saying that I'm a compulsive liar who will tell a lie about just about anything to save face (you're going to have to trust me that I'm being honest in this post and telling an unbiased side to my story.) 

So anyway lets go back 3 months to what is currently happening between me and my friend. We were going to community college together and that really solidified our friendship for a while. We talked pretty much every hour of the waking day and we had a really relaxed friendship going. More of something I was used to having with guys, but was relieved to have in a girl. (I was the youngest of 3 boys and I didn't go to public school until this college, so I didn't have much experience with girls, let alone friends.) 

Like I said we were pretty close friends, we joked each other (a lot) and we were always talking to each other about other girls (and boys) for each other to date. So around that time I started making a few other friends at the college, including a cute girl (lets call her Mandy) that I was interested in. I started to spend a little bit more time with them but I still kept up good with Sara and we still talked a lot. Well things with Mandy weren't going so well (she started going out with another one of my friends, but I was ok with it.) That wasn't going to stop me from having a good time though, so when I got invited up to a friends dorm to party with them I didn't turn it down. 

Long story short, I ended up driving, was kinda showing off and going a little faster than I should have and I went around a steep curve too fast in the rain, hydro-planed and skidded into a ditch totaling my car. Luckily, even though one of my dumb-ass friends wasn't wearing a seat belt, no one was seriously injured even though we were pretty shoken up.  I kinda went into a shock and repressed a lot of the memory of what happened that night. 

So flash forward about a week I'm shopping for a new car and I start talking to Sara again. I didn't tell Sara I wrecked my car (I didn't tell anyone) so I just told her I was just looking for a replacement because the old one just died (my last car was old and shitty) and she took it with gusto and helped me find a pretty sick deal. Flash forward another week and were back at college where apparently my other friends didn't waste much time in telling pretty much everyone what happened. Something I wasn't particularly happy about but I didn't tell them not to so I couldn't get angry. They were at the phase where they wanted to joke about it and It still was pretty traumatising for me so I didn't want to mention it. 

Well it didn't take long for news to get out to Sara that I crashed my car and I stopped getting texts back from her. Later that day when I asked what was wrong she called me out, telling me I was a bullshitting liar who thought she was dumb or something. I didn't plan on ever telling her what happened because it was pretty traumatizing to me and I didn't feel like sharing that experience. After many apologies (some of which might have been excuses) on my part I just stopped trying and I haven't talked to her since. If I see her in public she just ignores me or walks away. The worst part is I don't know exactly what she heard, because I'm pretty sure she got the story second hand from Mandy who was going through some rough stuff of her own at the time so she might have twisted the details a bit.

Flash forward to today. Mandy got broken up with by her boyfriend, toyed with me a bit then dropped me pretty quickly for someone else, won't barely talk to me anymore. Sara hasn't spoken to me in months, and I'm pretty much as an all time low emotionally. Not looking for much advice in the me and Mandy relationship, I just really want some way to reform my friendship with Sara. Any advice is welcome and I'd love to hear about your similar stories and how they worked out.

25708,Non-Romantic,2wtz1z,"Background:

My father divorced my mother when I was in second grade and remarried within a year (afghan marriage's X_X), and after he remarried he and my now step-mom[40/F] had my youngest brother [7/M] and have had a rocky relationship with each other every time I go visit them at their place.

Right now:

My step-mother and father paid to have the childhood house I grew up in to be rebuilt from the ground up into this mega house/mansion and when that's done they'll all have their own separate room.

About their relationship:

My father has never gotten along with my younger brother. He's a very active child who can't control himself sometimes but acts his age and doesn't mind holding his tongue at anyone. He's enrolled in basketball and we've found it's a great outlet for him to release all of his energy. But his attitude and behavior don't mesh will with my father who's used to His Rule is Final type of relationship. he'll always question what he's doing and make comments that gets him yelled at by my father time and time again. My step-mother knows that he cannot control what he says but does her best to control herself while disciplining him accordingly. He makes comments and pokes/teases everyone around him and wants to have as much fun.

Today:

I visited them and had lunch with them. My younger brother has no problem trying to tease me about my ex-girlfriend. My father sees that as a form of disrespect and just said 

&gt;I hate you for doing that *(-insert younger brothers name-)*

This raised a flag with my step-mom and myself. I used to take offense to what he said but overtime I realized he's just doing it for my attention since I don't come and visit him as much (i'm in college atm). My immediate response was wtf dad not cool and my step-mom couldn't believe he said that.

I need some advice on how to handle or even fix my younger brothers' relationship with my father. He's gung ho about having his way or the high way. Since my parents divorced I never had to deal with it unlike my older[29/M] brother and now younger brother is going through it.

Visiting them is fairly hard right now but I do not think it's enough to fix their relationship or at least make it like my father **shows some parental** love for him. I'm really afraid that this relationship between him and my younger brother is going to foster into some late rebellion and cause some permanent trauma down the line.

**tl;dr**: I'm looking for some advice on how to make my younger bro's relationship with my father not be the key that opens the door to my step-mom divorcing him and losing any chance of seeing him grow up.

25709,Non-Romantic,2u5bhh,"Hi. I am a 2 year long lurker. This is a throwaway for various reasons. Also, excuse any grammatical mistakes and if the story seems jumbled. My head is not in the right place and English is not my primary language.

I’d like to start off by saying I am in my senior year of college. Due to some issues, I had to stay a few extra semesters and I was incredibly annoyed. I had many problems finding housing or people to live with. I searched everywhere. All my close friends that I used to live with graduated. I stayed. I was desperately trying to find housing since I had many fall outs and people who attempted to scam me. Anyway, point is, finding housing was extremely difficult and I was ready to take a leave of absence. I know many students were on the same boat. There was an increase of students attending the University this year and there was a housing shortage.

So two weeks before school started, I started desperately texting the few friends I had in my college town while I visited my parents during summer break. One friend answered. Let’s call him Greg [25M]. He was a former coworker and a friend. He insisted I live with him and his two friends, Peter[21M] and Chris[22M]. I knew all of them from my old job. Peter and Chris were my former coworkers as well. I decided why not? It was only temporary until I got on my feet. 

I got there and it was agreed since the beginning that I would not be added on the lease. The apartments in my college town are extremely expensive. Adding one more to the lease will increase the rent. So, I still pay rent but the landlord does not know I live there necessarily. It’s been 6 months and so far I have raised little suspicion. This apartment is high tech so I do not have access to the building unless someone let’s me in. The key cannot be duplicated due to security reasons. Okay, I was a little wary that I would have to depend on these guys to open the building and let me inside the room. I’ve worked around it. I leave to school the whole day and come back late at night when I know everyone is home. A few times, they have not answered their phones or I just wait outside until someone from the building opens the doors. Not the most dependable but I tried to keep my patience. I have had a few issues living with the guys but a few weeks ago was my breaking point. 

We all went drinking one night. We have done this in the past with my housemates and they get a little flirty but I dismiss it. Usually, I do my own thing and talk to other guys at the bar. We usually separate throughout the night and meet up after.  I am single but I have a “no housemate, no hook up rule.” Also, I don’t have casual sex. I need an emotional connection or chemistry to take that step. They all know this. I have voiced this several times to make my boundaries clear. Call me prude or whatever but that’s how it is with me.

I pace myself when I drink and I rarely get sick so this isn’t a common occurrence. For some reason, this night I got sloppy drunk. I remember the night in fragments. I don’t know how I got so intoxicated so fast. Maybe a mix of drinks? I have a friend that I confided in and she suggested my drink might have been spiked while I was in the bathroom. I don’t know. I had five drinks in total. I did drink more than usual. I doubt it was spiked. I blacked out and don’t fully remember how I got to my room. 

Peter later told me that he half carried me to room. I remember Peter being super respectful and touching me only by my waist to lead me to the room but that’s about it. I remember throwing up in the bathroom not being able to stand up. Then I go to my room, which I share with Chris, and I sit there trying to focus on what’s happening. Next thing I know, I tell Chris to get me a bag. He rushes to get me a bag. I’m on all fours puking my brains out. I remember my skirt lifting up and I try to pull it down. 

I feel pressure against my back WHILE MY FACE IS STILL IN THE BAG HEAVING. I feel hands fondling my breasts. I feel him hard on my backside and his grunts. He moves my hair to the side and starts kissing my neck. I take my face out of the bag and I look down. He’s fondling me. I let it happen for a couple more seconds. I guess I was in shock or too drunk.  I start protesting and I shrug him off. He immediately gets off and turns off the lights. I pass out. 

I wake up early still drunk. I wash everything. I clean up my disgusting mess in the bathroom before anyone wakes up. I leave everything spotless. I go get some breakfast and that’s when I start getting flashbacks. I want to cry. I go back to the apartment. I can’t even look at him without getting enraged. He’s acting like nothing happened!

I confide in my two other housemates since I am feeling violated. Greg is extremely amused and Peter sounds more sympathetic. I snap and tell them I’m very angry. I tell them he is lucky I’m not pressing charges and he’s lucky I didn’t leave him sterile. 

The housemates told Chris what happened and how I was feeling. Chris contacted me and asked me if I wanted to go out for coffee and talk about it. I said coffee wasn’t necessary but we will talk.  His excuse? He was intoxicated as well and he thought, “I was down and I wanted it.” He thought I was giving off signs. My jaw dropped. What the hell? He did apologized but followed it with reasons. I did mention while intoxicated that I was sexually frustrated when Peter asked if I was. I also said how I felt so unwanted. Those were my insecurities peaking out though. 

Let me be clear: I am not attracted to any of my housemates. I’ve never flirted with them or hit on them purposely. I am very turned off by their personalities. I want respect in the house. How could I have been giving off signs while I was throwing up? How am I supposed to feel unsafe in my own room? This is ridiculous. Yes, I got really drunk but I was not asking for it. That’s how Chris explained it to me. He made me feel like I was asking for it. I mean I do dress up to go out but I do it for me not for them. He hinted at there being tension. I felt no tension. I don’t know what he is talking about. I even go out of my way to not provoke anyone by covering up before bed and not wear my usual sleepwear. Only time I dress revealing is when I go out. I am really not seducing anyone. That’s how I’ve always dressed. Things have not been the same with Chris. I hate him so much. I feel like I have no friends. I feel so disrespected. I can't get over it.  

**Other incidents that have made me uncomfortable (some resolved):**

-Greg has tried to kiss me once when we were drunk. I stopped him. I told him to never let it happen again. He listened. 

-Greg needing to see me in certain outfits so he can jack off to me. I dismissed him and said no. 

-Chris and Greg are huge potheads to the point where they get behind on rent.

-Greg owes me a large amount of money. Couple of months later, he still hasn’t paid me. 

-Chris has talked about my chest and backside many times in a vulgar way. I tell him to stop but he keeps looking at me and it makes me uncomfortable. 

-Greg often jokes about raping women or hitting them. Very masochist. I don’t find it funny. 

-All of them degrade women when they speak about them. They are so entitled that they should be able to fuck all women because they want to.  

Peter is the only one who I feel comfortable in the house. We have had our heart to heart talks. Purely based on friendship, at least on my end. I’ve caught him looking at me a couple of times but I dismiss it. For the most part, he’s respectful. My housemates CAN be nice but when they are under the influence, that's when most of the inappropriateness stems from.  

Was it sexual assault? I don’t know. I haven’t told my family. I am done with school in a couple of months. I feel like my hands are tied because I am not on the lease and they can technically leave me homeless. Also, I don’t have a key. They can be passive aggressive and just not open the door for me. I’m still in school this semester. I can move out with a friend but that won’t be for another month and a half. Other than that, I have very little options. I have very little money and cannot afford a security deposit. I’ve been job hunting. I’m sure I’ll land something in a few weeks. I don’t know what I am looking for here. I guess it’s nice to vent. My friend is trying to convince me to press charges but I don’t know. He did stop when I wanted him to… 

**tl;dr**: I [23F] have felt rather uncomfortable living with three men for a few months now. I had my breaking point a few weeks ago in a drunken incident. My housemate [22M] got on top of me and fondled me while I was throwing up. He stopped when I shrugged him off. Is this sexual assault? 

**Edit:** The University has found me housing on campus. Actually, they found me a lot of housing options. I even get to pick which one I am the most comfortable with. Thank you all so much for the support and the advice. I do appreciate it. I had the most caring and amazing counselors guiding me the whole way.

I was invited to the wedding as well.  Anyway, after about a few months, they had a pretty bad divorce where the divorce courts had dragged it on for several more months.  When it came down to this, rumors began to spread about who was at fault.  Sarah [25F] came to me for support, as she did not have anyone to turn to, which I believed.

At the same time, Matt text me asking about Sarah and whether I was approached by her or if she was at my place (just for visiting nothing more).  I did not respond as I felt that there was immense tension since Sarah avoided any contact with Matt since he would continually stalk her.  Over the months, she was getting bombarded with text messages about how he loves her or that he threatened to kill he cat.  It was very sporadic in what he was trying to say.  Anyway, I just wanted to avoid getting in between them, so I just focused on one side rather than mediate.  Also, I agreed with her points that the guy had a severe gambling problem (but that's another story).

Getting to the point, I have been invited by another friend (Peter/29M) to his wedding and Matt is going to be attending.  Not sure if Peter knows about my falling out with Matt, but I intend to go.

Friend suffers from anxiety and doesn't have many other people to talk to because he doesn't now how to make friends or get out of the house. As a result, my inbox is very frequently brimming with messages from him. He usually wants to talk to me all day, every day because he has no one else to talk to and expects me to be there. 

It's been stressing me out a lot, especially with how my life has been recently and with how my mental ills are worsening. Between the general stress and bad timing of being in an abusive (past, not current) relationship, I'd stopped talking to him for a short period of time. He got upset with me and said he didn't want to be my friend anymore and it really hurt me. No matter how much I tried to talk, he wouldn't respond.

I kept trying, all the while being entirely spiteful in my head that he'd just sweep 10 years of an impossible friendship under the rug like it was nothing because he didn't know if he could trust me again and [I] made the decision not to talk to him. Not my abusive ex. Me. But...eventually we got back to talking over Twitter, and I finally got him comfortable with texting me again. Except it's incessant...again. And it's bothering the SO. Again. Reasonably so- hell, it's still bothering the piss out of me.

My SO doesn't make a big fuss, just a comment when I get ten texts within the span of three minutes. I am just putting myself in his shoes and can imagine it might bother him more than he's putting off.

So...what I'm getting at here is this: how unhealthy is this friendship? How can I reduce communication without getting snapped at again? This friendship is the third most important relationship in my life. I mainly want to relieve some stress on my part but I am also concerned for my SO.

Questions for further clarification are welcomed- AMAA.

25736,Non-Romantic,2nyfcb,"So my parents got divorced when I was ten years old. It wasn't too bad they kept me pretty shielded from most of it. There was a lot of fighting before hand and I remember being happy that they were getting a divorce. I have always had a pretty good relationship with both of my parents. However, I've always been a daddy's girl and when my parents split up I asked if I could live with my dad.

 Of course, my dad was thrilled, my mom less so. But she went with what I wanted, so I live with my dad during the school year and go to my mom's on the weekends and I live with her in the summer and go to my dads on the weekends in the summer. 

My mom is still single, she dates some but is really focused on her job right now- she is a designer and is starting up a new firm. She seems really happy from what I can tell. She is very focused on her job.

When I was 12 my dad started dating Jamie. I knew that they were dating, but my dad didn't introduce us for the first six months or so of their relationship. I am really shy so we didn't connect that much at first, but eventually as she started coming around more we got really close. I never talked to my mom that much about Jamie because honestly I was worried she would get jealous or something... also it just felt weird to talk about my dads relationship with her. Sometimes she would ask about Jamie but I always dodged the questions or answered very short. 

Jamie moved in with me and my dad after they had been dating for three years, when I was 15, and 8 months ago they got married. It was a really small ceremony with only family. (I am an only child by the way)

Jamie doesn't have kids, she was married before but she is unable to have children and her and her ex-husband decided not to adopt. I am pretty sure Jamie wanted kids I don't really know she never has talked to me about it.

Since Jamie started living with us she helped out my dad more, which he loved. She took over packing my lunch for school (she works from home) and she drives me to school so now I don't have to ride the bus anymore. And she cooks dinner every night, my dad knows how to cook and used to cook for us... but Jamie is much better at it haha. 

Jamie and I are really close, it's so nice to live with another girl during the week because now I have someone to get advice on my clothes for school, and because my dad doesn't get off work until 7PM I have someone to help me with my homework before hand. If I needed help he used to help after dinner, which I didn't like because I like to get done with it early. 

When I go to bed at night Jamie and my dad both tell me they love me. It is like I have a happy whole family. And I feel really guilty for that because I feel like I am betraying my mom. I am still close with my mom and always come to her house and spend time with her on the weekends. But I sometimes find myself missing Jamie when I am with my mom. I of course miss my mom too when I am at my dads. Which is confusing because I miss my step mom and my dad when I am at my moms instead of just my dad. I don't know it is weird to me.

I just feel guilty because I feel like I have another great mom. So it is like I have two moms... and I feel like it is unfair to my mom to feel this way. My mom got mad at me when she heard me on the phone with Jamie because I said bye, love you. But I say that too my mom too so I don't understand why it is a big deal. I love all of my parents.

Also sometimes (since Jamie moved in really) my mom has been making some comments that make it seem like she is mad at me for being close with Jamie. 

I don't know I guess I just feel confused because I didn't expect to feel this way. Ugh. Divorce is confusing and so are step parents... I don't really know what advice I'm asking for but I feel guilty and confused.

**TL;DR** I am close with my step mom and think of her as a second mom, my mom is kinda jealous about it and I feel guilty for feeling this way. Is there something I can do to help this situation?

There is a girl that clearly has a great romantic interest in me and has been this way for about two years. This is a one sided feeling. I do not share in the sentiments that she has, though I am very nice to her because she does not have many friends. I have never over-stepped the friend line, and have never made any romantic gestures. 

Yesterday, she gave me a gift (my birthday was last week and Christmas is approaching) This was actually very uncomfortable for me. I feel that by accepting a gift from her I am encouraging her advances. After giving me the gift, which was a movie, a gift card, and some other random assortments of candy and such, she asked me to go to our school's winter formal with her. I felt very pressured to say yes, mainly because she had just given me gifts but also because I genuinely try to be a nice person and improve other's lives. If I am single and probably not going to go with anybody else, isn't it right to go with her, strictly as friends? Do you guys think that I am leading her on or encouraging something, or am I doing the right thing?

25778,Non-Romantic,36a5aq,"Background:

My mother has kicked me out of home 3 times, from when I was 16, 17, and then 24. The last time, she spent  over a year coaxing me to come back and live with her when I was 21. 

My family has come to see my mother as controlling and possibly mentally imbalanced, or possesses narcissistic personality disorder.

I feel my mother (or my dad, for that matter) never really took care of me beyond providing me a place to sleep and food (most times) to eat. Despite my constant urge to please, good grades, never doing drugs, not drinking alcohol, never doing anything reckless or criminal, I never felt I received much in the way of attention or nurturing. I was the child they ignored because they could I guess.

Anyway, my mother discovered my father was cheating on her, and despite my initial sympathy, and the considerable time I spent with her counselling her, she launched the family into an incredibly damaging long ordeal, attempting to turn all the children against my father. When she didn't get her way, she refused to sign any sales or allow my father to sell any of the properties they owned together, until after 4 years of paying astronomical interest on the mortgages with no returns (she was pocketing rent without his knowledge), and borrowing money from friends, he defaulted on the loans and the banks foreclosed. My mother gained significantly when the divorce settlement, receiving at least $900 a week alimony, and the only remaining property. My father (57M) has no assets, and had to take out a considerable loan (somewhere in the $100-300k range) to service the amounts he and my mother had jointly owed others. He only has what money he earns from hereonout.

During this time, my mother launched 2 court cases against my sister to gain *custody* of her 3 children, 2F, 4M, 12F, labelling my sister an unfit mother, a druggie, and an alcoholic. She also launched legal action against my brother and sister-in-law's family, attempting to get access to his children. My brother and sister-in-law refused to allow my mother to see their kids, because of the overt way in which she was making my sister's kids guilt and blame their grandfather over issues they should have no knowledge of.

In the midst of all this, she kicked me out of my home, a granny flat located in the family home with no warning. I was working fulltime, and received a text message saying that she felt I didn't appreciate her anymore (because I wasn't attacking my father and doing everything she was asking of me) had changed the locks, and had moved all my stuff outside. I was to collect and remove  my stuff immediately or she would throw it out.

This was extremely traumatic for me. Being kicked out for the 3rd time, with no warning, no notice, no logical reason, while working fulltime, and starting my Honours year at university the next week was shattering. And to top it off, she tried to keep all my furniture, and hid both my laptop and PS3. It was only when I involved the police that I got possession back of the laptop and my furniture. 

I told her shortly after that I would be blocking her on my phone, and that she was not to contact me again.

That was 4 years ago. I haven't spoken to her since that day.

Now, my sister (who has been drawn back to her, and to whom my mother has given $100k towards buying a home), has told me that my mother wants to make a similar offer to me, of $100k. My sister tells me that my mother is doing well, that she's no longer mentally imbalanced, and doesn't appear to bear any grudges against my father or his now fiancee anymore, and is offering this because my mother wants to make sure her children are taken care of, an early inheritance.

Yet, as you can imagine, I am extremely wary. She was extremely controlling, unpredictable, and her gifts usually turned out to have conditions. Additionally, the money she has was gained in very painful circumstances, from my father in a protracted and very acrimonious divorce settlement, and my brother, from the investment she had potentially illegally signed him up for using the power-of-attorney she had while he was travelling overseas (and which involved many painful court appearances to rectify as well).

So, I'm basically asking what should I do. I'm not rich or well off my any means ($6000 in assets, including cash), so $100k would be lifechanging. But I'm only just getting my life back together after 4 years of crippling depression and anxiety, thinking more clearly  about where I want to go, and what I want to do with my life, and I feel this could turn into yet another point where she disrupts it at a crucial juncture.

Should I ignore her still, or accept this money?

I imagine if I was to take the money, I think my best option would be to send a contract to her through my sister, stating that she was providing me $100k as a unconditional gift, with no accompanying obligations, and that this money was to be paid into my bank account xxx xxxx xxxx. 

This way I still avoid talking to her or having contact with her, and it will clarify whether she's doing it to 'set me up' as she says, or simply using it as a means to ingratiate herself once more.

Your thoughts would be much appreciated.

TLDR: Narcissistic controlling mother who has kicked me out of home 3 times with no warning and caused terrible family pain wants to give me 'tainted' $100k, but could she just be wanting to sink her hooks into me again? Should I accept, and if so, how should I accept?

25779,Non-Romantic,3en6q3,"I have a friend who's become increasingly draining and I've reached a point now where I'm trying to set boundaries and am feeling very guilty for doing so. This friend is insecure and afraid of being rejected, but that kind of insecurity can sometimes make people behave in a self-absorbed way as they are *so* focused on how they feel that they forget to consider what kind of friend they're actually being to anyone else. She has been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and was in group therapy for this and is now seeing an individual counsellor but not in one of the approaches recommended for BPD.

I've been finding this so hard because I do actually care about her and value her friendship but I can't take much more of her insecurity and neediness. I've reached a point where I'm having to withdraw. I don't want to hurt her, but I don't know what else to do. 

The main issues I've been having are as follows:

* Constantly texting me real-time updates about what she's doing. I don't think she ever stopped to consider whether they're of interest to me. She was using me as a kind of sounding board for her internal monologue. I know I'm not obliged to read or reply to texts but it reached a volume that was really intrusive and it reached a point where my heart would sink. 
* She kept saying she loved me, obviously waiting for me to say it back. (We are both married and straight, so we're definitely just talking friend love here.) I will occasionally tell my friends I love them but I only routinely say that to one person and I'm married to him.
* She kept describing me as her best friend. I've known her for three years and have friends I've known for more like 10-20 years. It made me feel kind of smothered. I don't have a best friend, I have different friends I see at different times. I don't like feeling like someone is trying to claim ownership over me or being possessive. And I'm not 12, I don't need to announce who is My Best Friend.
* She talks about people behind their backs. She says she doesn't talk about me that way, but I don't like hearing it. Other than real-time updates on exactly what she's doing, bitching seems to be her main conversational currency and it's really not okay with me. I don't mean to sound like I think I'm all that, but I don't want to hear her constantly complain about people.
* She can be really passive aggressive. She complained about a friend, I expressed an opinion she didn't like and she said: I knew I shouldn't have brought this up, I won't make that mistake again. 

A month or so ago, I told her I couldn't chat as I had to work. Later that day, she texted me saying she felt like nobody wanted to be friends with her today and she was fighting the urge to try and fish for reassurance. I replied saying do you want to try again as that wasn't okay with me? She said oh I don't mean you, I just thought I could say it to you. I asked her if she had considered how it might feel to say I was busy and then get that message? 

A few weeks ago, she went incommunicado for about ten days. I was so relieved to be free of the constant updates about how she's vacuuming her floor. I do care about her and value her friendship (and I probably sound like a total bitch) but she was driving me insane. I wish she would admit that she can't tolerate being alone because of BPD, but she keeps insisting she's just really sociable.  

When she re-emerged, I said I just couldn't go back to the previous level of communication. I said I was sorry but I have my own business, I'm studying for a masters and I have another part-time job. I just don't have the time or headspace to read constant messages. She passive aggressively said fine, I won't take up any more then. 

I said look, I'm not trying to hurt you but I am overwhelmed and I cannot cope with the amount of interaction you want. She said no it's fine, the person with the lower level of tolerance gets to set the boundary and she just has to put up with it. She also told me she was hurt because my level of comfort was her idea of not even trying to be a friend. (We have very different ideas of what being a friend means, and mine doesn't involve waking up and immediately sending 5-10 What'sApp messages about things I really do not need to know.)

She has pretty much blanked me ever since. I messaged her the other day with some really good news I'd been waiting for, and she said: Well done, and that was it. So because I'm not willing to be totally overwhelmed, I'm in the doghouse. I'm frustrated and upset because I feel like she's trampled through all my boundaries and now I'm ending up seeming like the bad guy. 

I understand that a lot of this is down to her BPD and she has worked really hard to learn to manage this but I don't think she has any empathy for me. It is stressful and draining trying to maintain a friendship with someone who can't go one day without contacting you. She is so afraid of being rejected and I feel under pressure not to hurt her and feed her self-fulfilling prophecy.

The thing I find hardest is that she says things like: see, I'm not a nice person, I knew you'd find out sooner or later. Frankly, that's a cop-out. It makes me feel like I'm in an abusive relationship. I don't know if she gets that I'm walking on eggshells and I can't tell her because then I'll be proving her 'right'. 

It's reached a point now where I've stopped making any effort and would happily let the friendship drift, but I feel like a terrible, terrible person as I know that would hurt her. I care about her a lot but I can't handle the intensity she wants. I don't know what to do. I don't want to be responsible for causing her upset but I think in the long run that has led to me doing exactly that as I should have defined my own boundaries sooner.

I want a normal friendship like I have with everyone else but I don't think she's capable of having one. I'm *absolutely not* trying to stigmatise or be disparaging about people with BPD, let me make that clear. It just seemed like a key piece of information to include. I probably sound like a horrible person but I don't know if I can continue trying to maintain a friendship with her. And I guess it's not fair on her if I can't just accept her as she is. 

As it stands, she's not contacting me at all since I said I can't handle constant texts. (She would send me like 8-10 in a row and send photos of everything she was doing.) If I don't contact her, either the friendship will just drift (and I'll be the bad guy) or she'll eventually explode at me. And while I don't want to lose her friendship, I'm not sure what else I can do. If I explain all this it's just going to shame her.

**Background:**





My parents divorced when I was twelve, and since then, he's been an absolute asshole. It was quite a nasty divorce, with all sorts of rumours flying around the little village we live in - mostly that he was cheating on my mum. We've never been able to prove anything, but less than six months after their separation he moved in with a lady friend, and married her a year later.




His relationship with his kids is a lot less rosy. We're triplets, me and two brothers, and he's been trying to control every aspect of our lives since the split. Everything from how we act to how we look has been scrutinised and compared to his stepsons [26, 28 &amp; 31M]. He pushed and pushed for all three of us to go into the armed forces like them, and would constantly tell the boys to bulk up, to act more manly, that if they were being bullied at school, it was because they weren’t acting right. He compared them constantly to her 'perfect' family, and always used the stepbrothers as examples. 




As for me... I was quiet, liked reading and liked black dresses and antique jewellery. I'd never partied, never had a boyfriend, and he hated that. He wanted me to lose weight, get a tan, bleach my hair and wear short skirts. He'd prod at my stomach and laugh at my fashion choices and get my brothers to join in - and all of this *before I was fourteen*. He was ashamed of my good grades and my good-girl attitude, and told me I was boring and too ‘prissy’. He wanted Barbie, he got Hermione Granger.




It's only got worse as time has gone on. All three of us rejected his military vision, refused to change who we were, and now he's switched tack to our personal and professional lives. His love is conditional to our following his wishes exactly, or we'll be yelled at, belittled and yet again compared to his new family. Just having a job and renting with friends isn’t good enough, there must be a high-paying career, a mortgage, marriage, car and grandchildren, and he wants it all *now*. 




Don’t want to get married or have kids? Happy in a fulfilling, if low-paying job with people you love? Don’t care. He wants three status symbols to brag to his friends about, and has never once approved of a decision we made. Even on my graduation day, he told me I was stupid for not quitting and going to work abroad instead – like my stepbrother.




We’ve all reacted differently. One brother (Chris) has spent the last few years either being screamed at or avoiding him every chance he gets. My other brother Mark has ended up so severely mentally ill that he hasn’t been able to leave the house in two years. This is, of course, Mark’s fault, and if he just got up and got a job then he’d be instantly better (Dad’s the type of person who believes depression doesn’t exist, and that it’s all Mark’s fault for ‘not trying hard enough’.) I’m in and out of therapy with daddy issues that weigh a tonne, and yet I’m the only one who speaks to Dad regularly. I don’t remember a visit where we talked normally. He never calls us, I always have to call him, and when I see him is his decision. The usual answer is ‘I’m busy, I’ll call you,’ followed by no call and an angry rant that I, again, don’t try enough. He’ll insist I show up spontaneously, and then either not be home or turn me away at the door because his other family – who he always wants me to get to know, ironically enough – is there. We live in the same village, but I’m lucky if I see him three times a year.




**The problem:**




But what does this have to do with my birthday? Every year for as long as I can remember, the day has been ruined by his behaviour. It’s been marred by screaming matches, rants against our character, petty revenge attempts and jealousy. Mark is so terrified of him that he has panic attacks at the sight of him. Dad has given Chris’s birthday present to charity and then, while handing out actual presents to the other two of us, handed him a note that read: ‘in the hope that you’ll actually think of others for once.’ 



Some shit like this happens every. Single. Year. And now I hate my own birthday. I dread it, and hope for it to just be over quickly. I’ve gotten myself so worked up in recent years I’ve actually cried at the thought, which appalls my mum’s side of the family. 



We turn twenty-four tomorrow, and usually it’s me who calls to ask Dad if we’ll be seeing him for our own goddamn birthdays. But this year, I didn’t. I haven’t said anything, and just waited for him to contact me. He hasn’t, and now all I can think about is what’s going to happen tomorrow. Either he’s going to show up and upset everybody again, or he’s going to ignore us altogether, and I don’t know which is worse. I’m so sick of wishing for this man’s love and approval, but at the same time I’m imagining how the inevitable argument will go in my head. I’m not sure if I’m angry, sad or resigned at this point, and I don’t know how to handle it.



What do I do?



**TLDR**: After their divorce my Dad turned into a controlling asshole who has done a lot of damage to my brothers and me. He ruins our birthday every year with his behaviour, and I’m dreading what’s going to happen tomorrow. Please help.

She has no contact with her biological “horrible, crazy” mother and refuses to continue their relationship. She uses this as leverage to push herself further into my SO’s family by playing the “poor me, I have no mother” sympathy card, making my SO’s mother take her under her wing and treat her like a daughter. This makes me feel so left out. I have a relationship with my mother, and get along well with my family but can’t help but feel down about knowing I’ll never be seen like her by my MIL. 


At parties and dinners, my MIL will sometimes refer to her as “like a daughter to me” but has never said this about me. My MIL always speaks so highly about her to her friends and work colleges but never about me. They didn’t know I was even apart of the family at one stage, which crushed me. I’m not really jealous (maybe a little), but more so it just really upsets me and makes me feel down about myself. 


Here are some of the things she has done/does that really annoy my SO and I:


•	Will do things with my SO mother without inviting me even though I'm there when they are leaving – they will get coffee together, get haircuts together, get their nails done, go shopping

•	If for some reason I finally spend time with my fMIL (I did my MIL’s hair and makeup for an event) she sulked the entire time at the event, didn’t speak the whole night and gave me crazy eyes across the table like she wanted to kill me. This has been the first time that I felt favored over her

•	She is always hugging and calling my MIL “a wonderful mom” and “the best mom anyone could ask for”

•	When my MIL isn’t home she uses her bathroom and uses her hairdryer, makeup, etc (THIS IS WEIRD ISN’T IT?!)

•	At my in-laws place she will leave items of hers everywhere just so you know it is more her home than yours. We call this “marking her territory”. She will leave her cookbooks in the kitchen and dining room, her makeup all in the bathroom, her razor in the shower (!!), her shoes at the front door, cutesy notes to her SO and my MIL (cringe) on the bench 


I could go on and on but I’ll refrain. She just annoys me so much and it disappoints me even more cause we should ideally have a good relationship and should get along. It shouldn’t be a competition and for her, it always will be. 


Help me figure this out and feel better! Am I alone in this?!

25800,Non-Romantic,2al96d,"To give you the backstory I have 2 weddings I will be invited to in spring. The wedding I have already decided to attend is my best guy friend from high schools wedding. I know his family, know his fiancee and have even attended his grandpa's funeral. Him and his fiancee got engaged right around the same time my fiance and I did and we have even been making sure our weddings arent too close together so we can be there for each other.

The other wedding is a friend from college (and a different circle of friends) that I've lost a lot of contact with. She made some decisions I did not necessarily agree with and found herself in a few difficult situations. I've always tried to be there for her as it seems she doesnt have a lot of other girlfriends. In the past she has told me I'd be one of her bridesmaids one day but so far I havent heard anything. I'm terrified that she will ask me to be one of her bridesmaids because I would have to turn it down as im getting married about a month prior but I dont even plan on attending her wedding in the first place. They live several states away but are getting married in their home state, where I live. The weddings are on opposite sides of the state so its not really feasible to attend one ceremony and one reception. 

I'd like to do this sooner rather than later out of respect and consideration for her. Has anyone ever found themselves in a similar situation or have advise for me on how to gracefully break the news to her?

My dad, for some reason, does not like visiting his mother on his own (I think because he finds it annoying having to explain things to her). So he makes my mum and I go with him if he can. My mum has a cold at the moment so she's been ill, sleeping and feeling sick. 

My dad asked if she'd come with him to take some food to my grandma (why she can't order her own food to her house I don't know, she's not incapable and she has a car and can drive) and my mum said said she was ill and didn't feel like it (nor did she want to take her bug round the elderly). So he suggested my grandma came over. Another bad idea; my mum is ILL and doesn't want to entertain a guest.

Then just as he was leaving to go visit my grandma, my dad turned to me aaaaand:

(Bearing in mind, this is the first time he'd even told me about it)

This happens all the time! We've spent time with my grandma over Christmas, over New Year, my parents go over every Saturday for lunch (not this weekend because my mum has been ill) for as long as I can remember. I don't anymore because I'm at uni but it seems as though this weekend ritual of eating together HAS to happen and when it's his mum, my dad has to drop everything at the expense of others in the house, and make whatever it is she wants to happen, happen. He doesn't sort things out in our house as quickly as he sorts it out for his mum. 

My mum and I were chatting after he left and she shares my frustration. She said if it were her, and my dad was ill, she'd say you stay at home, don't worry about it and I'll go see my mum on my own, or something. 

So now we're going to be facing the consequences of this for the next few days. What now? I don't feel as though we're in the wrong for saying no this time.

25813,Non-Romantic,1r3oz1,"My mom is a single parent.  She raised my brother (20M), my sister (13f), and me completely alone and devoid of any financial support from our wayward, alcoholic father.  My mom is also suffering from bipolar disorder and anxiety.  She works 60 hours a week as an accountant and is going to school to get her bachelors degree (she is done in February).  My mother is one of the most irrational, controlling, manipulative people on the planet.  Let me go into this as detailed as I can. 

My entire childhood, my mother has never had much money.  Which has never bothered me.  We got most of our clothes from thrift stores. Again, that was just fine.  Now, I have a job and buy my own clothes, food, school fees, etc.  

My mother has never been a nice person.  I'm sure all teenage girls have issues with their moms at some point in time.  However, my mom has very little regard for feelings.  When my brother was in the home, she'd torment him constantly and control him.  She'd take advantage of his job, his time, etc.  At our house, we never had time for friends as children.  When we came home, we were expected to stay home and clean up the house and take care of yard work.  When my brother started working, I was in charge of taking care of my younger sister, housework, and our lawns. 

Now I am a senior in high school.  I work thirty hours a week, take care of housework, and have a 3.87 GPA in AP and Honors classes at my high school.  I have a full ride scholarship to a university 300 miles away next fall.  I never ask for money.  She always knows where I am.  However, she can't be happy with this.  If I ask to go out with friends or on a date, she flips shit.  She makes me stay home and tells me what an ungrateful cunt I am for trying to get out of work when she has to work fifty/sixty hours a week.  She tells my sister all the time that she's retarded (she's young and not very clean).  She still stalks my brother and coerces him into doing things for her.  She constantly harasses me about everything.  If one of us cries at her name calling or mean things, she locks us in the bathroom.  She is extremely... Rude.  When I talk to her or ask for advice she either criticizes it or ignores me.  For example, I told her I wanted to be an elementary school teacher she said you don't know what you want.  I don't know what she thinks she wants me to do, but apparently not that... 

I have tried telling her to be nice.  I've communicated by telling her how she makes me/us feel when she calls us names, disregards our plans/priorities, or harasses us in any way.  I've tried in all possible ways to communicate with her and tell her to try to be kinder and she refuses.  

She happened to look up my grades last week and I have a F in Math 1050/1060 right now because I missed a few assignments and she got so pissed.  Today, she came to my school (going through all the effort to get off work) and walked me to tutoring.  She proceeded to tell me how stupid I was in front of people at my school and harassed tutors working with other kids.  She refused to go and made a huge scene about what an irresponsible cunt I was.  I'm pretty sure the cameras in the hallway got her pulling my hair when I got up to go to the bathroom.  She threatened to take me to the police station because I was being insubordinate.  I don't know what to do anymore and I don't know how to tell her to leave me alone.  She expects me to be completely responsible for myself, but treats me like a child.  I don't want to go to child services because that wouldn't be fair to my little sister, who was diagnosed with depression recently and wouldn't stand a chance in a halfway home.  I don't know how to deal with my mother any more.  There is no way to get out of her control and I feel stuck and scared.  If I leave to college, I have to file for housing while still a minor (my 18th birthday isn't until July) and she'll know where I live.  I need her tax return until I hit a certain age for financial aid.  I won't be able to afford health insurance while in school (which is the only thing she would provide for me).  I am completely at a loss about what to do.  I don't want to leave my sister there, but there's nothing else to do.  

If possible, how can I get my mother to listen to me when I tell her she needs to be nicer?

My boyfriend and I have been seeing each other for 2 years now. He has a really close group of friends who had been hanging out regularly for 3-4 years before I met them. His friends' girlfriends who are twins (25F), are a part of this group and are really friendly to everyone. However, I feel that there's a little bit of superficiality to their niceness towards me as every get-together or party we go to, even my own birthday party, they only talk to me for a few minutes or don't seem remotely interested in what I have to say. I could be talking about a TV show we watched, something about my day, or even ask them about work and they just kind of give a bare minimum, disinterested answer or are looking around or at something else while they talk. I've also tried to invite them out to girls-only lunches/hikes over the course of two years, and they always say: Yeah, that sounds good! We should hang out and do stuff! We'll let you know when we're free! and never get back to me about anything (while posting pictures the next day of a brunch with their other friends).

--

My boyfriend has told me not to take it personally because everyone has busy schedules and that I may be expecting too much out of them. While I try not to take it personally, it's hurtful that they wouldn't invite me out or take me up on my invitations over TWO YEARS. I'm also paranoid that they don't like me (my boyfriend tells me I come off as kind of abrasive or harsh because people sometimes can't tell when I'm joking around) because they've told me that they only hang out with certain people in our group when their BF's are around because they don't trust/like the other guys. Additionally, one of our really good friends recently got a girlfriend who is manipulative and selfish (none of us like her, but most of us don't say anything) and the twins have told me they don't like her, but they talk to her more than they talk to me. They also hang out together with their boyfriends on their own outings and tonight even moved spots to sit next to her and share dessert.

--

Having heard these things but seeing them act buddy-buddy towards these people make me paranoid that the twins might dislike me even more than they dislike these people and that they don't really care if I can tell or not. This whole situation causes me a lot of anxiety because these girls and their BFs are VERY good friends of my BF and I really want to get along with them. It makes me feel like an asshole because I feel like they're the ones being jerks for not meeting me at least a quarter of the way in my efforts to bond/be friends.

25866,Non-Romantic,3d5iw0,"Background:  I've always more or less gotten along with my H's parent's.  In the beginning I was friendly with my SIL (34 F) as well, but over the years, things have gotten tense between us, and I tend to shy away from her during family gatherings if I can.  I don't ignore her, but I won't go out of my way to converse with her either.  I think she is fairly narcissistic, and self-centered.  The whole family caters to her, and she lives for their attention and for them to trip over themselves to make her happy.  She constantly disrespects her parents, and as I was raised that this wasn't acceptable, this bothers me. H will bend over backward to avoid going against her, even if to the detriment of our little family.  A couple of short examples:

-She will count and comment on the amount of presents at Christmas.  She will also complain if she has only opened boring presents (eg, socks, pjs), and MIL will sift around and find her something fun.

-SIL will complain about any kid paraphernalia that we have left at IL's that she has to use, like our old booster seat or play pen.  

-We are not allowed in the house during her kid's nap.  We are to stay outside lest we wake him up.  On a couple of occasions, I have taken my kids to the park to keep out of everyone's hair.  I have asked H to start going to IL's house after toddler's nap, but he doesn't like that idea as it limits the lengths of our visits.


The tipping point was over Easter weekend when we were planning on driving out to see his bio dad's family, not related to them (his parents are divorced, and he has family on his bio dad's side).  We attempted to see them on the same trip since we hadn't met the new baby yet, and the only time they wanted us to come was the exact time we were supposed to be at other SIL's.  Earlier or later didn't work because they didn't want us coming during their toddler's nap.  FIL sent us a condescending patronizing email, admonishing us for not immediately changing our plans to better suit them, so I was upset during the visit.

A few days after this, it came out that they all had multiple issues with me ranging from me paying more attention to my other SIL on Facebook, me apparently walking away from SIL one time last summer (could have happened, I don't recall), to us not contacting them after they had their second son (100% not true).  There was more, but in the interest of brevity, I won't list them all.  All of them were either grossly exaggerated, out of context, or just plain not true.  Some of their issues were actually my H's fault, but not wanting to throw him under the bus, I didn't correct them.  It boils down to them knowing that I am not crazy about SIL.  I've been dealing with my annoyance with her by distancing myself from her (like taking my kids to the park), and I guess it backfired.  I spent the week going back and forth with all three of them, defending myself and my actions, and apologizing to them all.

I don't know how to move past this.  I saw them all for the first time last weekend, and it was so awkward.  I ended up crying in the backyard in front of H's grandma (GMIL??).  She knew nothing about it, and asked why I was being so quiet, and I just broke down.  Mostly, I'm so very sad and disappointed in my H, and his failure to stand up for me.  He tells me all the time that this is just the way his family is, and he doesn't even notice his SIL's behavior anymore.  He just wants me to put a smile on my face to make them all happy.  Reddit, I have never been a good faker.  If I'm upset, it shows, no matter how I try to hide it.

I haven't mentioned anything to H about my feelings about how he handled it.  I didn't want to put him in the position of making his parents choose between him and SIL, as I know he is afraid they will choose her.  I need some perspective.  Am I being too stubborn?  Are my IL's really as crazy as I think they are?  Or is it me?  How do I approach this with H?

There was a period of time where I did pull away slightly -- but mainly because every time we talked it was about her issues with her fiance or some other drama in her life (her parents also were divorced in the year leading up to her engagement) and it was starting to weigh on me emotionally, not to mention that I wasn't getting much out of our friendship at that time. 

We now live in different cities across the country from one another. She even lives about 8 hours away from her fiance at the moment, who is planning to relocate to her city about a month before their wedding. 

Her approach to wedding planning has been virtually non-existent, which has me both anxious and kind of frustrated. Not to mention that I feel as though her relationship with her fiance has been (and perhaps still is) on shaky ground. I want to support her decision to marry him, help her plan her wedding and be there for her through what should be a really exciting time. I'm going to need to book time off of work to attend her wedding, and likely the festivities in the week before. 

So, reddit, what I'm asking is -- how do I, as her maid of honor, delicately ask my friend if she's actually getting married without offending or upsetting her?

25878,Non-Romantic,36t393,"Basically me and my friend, let's call her Mary, have been close friends for a long time. I can honestly say I have never met anyone like Mary, and everyone that has met Mary can say the same thing. She speaks her mind, she can be in your face, she's not afraid to be different, she loves being in the spot light, she has more haters than anyone I know, and she doesn't care.

Mary is also the biggest drama queen ever. If she thinks she has a cold, it must be the rarest form of pneumonia because no one could ever go through this bad of a cold, it's not normal. It's totally normal. It's always normal, but Mary blows things up to an extreme. She's also always sick, just one sickness after the other, after the other. While she's sick, she will google her symptoms and self diagnose herself with everything imaginable. Then when she goes to the doctor and finds out what it is, it'll just blow over. For example, she will go to the doctor because her hair is falling out more than usual. She also colours her hair every few weeks. But to her there’s no way that could be the reason her hair is falling out... it's because she could have disease A, B, or a combination of all the diseases in the world. It's really tiring trying to be concerned for her over and over again when 99% of the time it ends up being something super minor. 

Her latest is having anxiety. Anxiety is something that hits home for me because I take medication for anxiety. She told me she went to the doctor last Monday because she's been feeling more anxious lately. The doctor told her he will book her in to see a psychiatrist and there's a chance she could have anxiety but they have to get her blood test back and see what the psychiatrist says. She texted me every day until Saturday telling me shes freaking out about her anxiety and how she's getting worse and worse. This, all the sudden after seeing the doctor. 

On Saturday, a big group of us went camping for one night. We didn't get there until about 6 and we left at 4 the next day. In those 22 hours, she managed to have 4 full blown, crying, wheezing panic attacks. I've had panic attacks before and when I start feeling it build up I GTFO of there. All 4 times she had a panic attack it was in front of everyone and we would be like Mary, you okay? and she would be wheezing and crying saying she’s okay and we would ask her if she wanted to try and cool off and she would say no and continue to just sit there crying and whaling and have her panic attack in front of everyone. So basically in the 5 days between seeing the doctor about feeling anxious to camping she somehow developed an uncontrollable problem with having panic attacks. 

Also little things during camping happened, for example she accidently dropped a food container because she's just a clumsy person. I told her why don't you let Henry do it. And then she went off about how I'm doubting her, and she doubts herself all the time and basically relating it back her anxiety symptoms and problems. 

I don't really know what to say about this, I know everyone is different but personally panic attacks are scary, it's an out of body experience and the last thing I want to do is basically make a show out of it in front of all my friends. It's also unbelievable because it's progressing super fast. I just saw her last weekend, a day before she went to the doctor and she was fine... and not being a big cry baby, but after the doctor told her there's a chance she has anxiety this whole thing blew up. Because she knows I deal with this, she comes to me to talk about it A LOT.... A LOT and it's honestly getting really annoying to me because she's making such a big deal out of this and it's completely different than what I went through. I'm getting to a point where I kind of think she's just looking for sympathy and attention. But what if this is real? I don't know, it just seems so unreal to me.

I'm a 22 year old graduate student living on my own and working full time. I've fully supported myself for the past year and a half, and mostly supported myself for two years before that. 

Last Tuesday, I was in a car accident on my way to work. It was at a dangerous intersection where there was construction going on, but it was completely my own fault and I've never felt like a bigger idiot before. I rear-ended an incredibly understanding and kind woman, and fortunately neither of us was hurt. My insurance should cover way more than any damage that was done to her car, but mine was ten years old and was totaled. I didn't have collision coverage on it because it was so old, so I'll be taking public transit for a while until I've saved up for a new one. It didn't seem responsible to take out a car loan with student loans and an unsure future ahead of me after graduation.

I was driving a used car of my mom's that my parents generously gifted me a year ago. It needed extensive work done to be driveable (~$1500) but I needed to get back and forth for work at the time, so I put the money into it even though it was more than half of what the car was worth. In hindsight, that probably wasn't a smart investment. My parents were great and helped out with about $250 of the repairs because they didn't realize the car was in such disrepair when they gave it to me. 

I immediately called my mom because we generally have a fairly open relationship and I ask her advice pretty often. She was worried, but calm and simply told me to call the insurance company. Over the next two days I handled a lot of paperwork and wrestled with a lot of stress and guilt about having been dumb enough to drive less vigilantly than I should have and having wrecked a car I'd put so much money into. I missed about a day and a half of work to deal with towing the car to a yard, emptying out the car, arranging to sell it to a salvage yard, turning in my plates to the registry two towns away, going to city hall to get an excise tax abatement, filing the crash reports, and working with my insurance company.

On Thursday, I called my parents again on my way back to work after having sold the car to the salvage yard. My mom was still mostly calm, though somber and somewhat sympathetic to how upsetting this whole situation was for me. My dad, however, started to talk about how they were disappointed I had crashed the car they'd given me, especially after they'd put so much money into it to fix it up.

I was so stressed and upset by that point that I snapped at my dad. I told him that any disappointment he was feeling was probably a lot less than the disappointment I was feeling with myself for being so stupid and having put so much money into the car and that I really didn't want to hear it right then. He told me I really need to just pay better attention when [I] drive and not take [my] eyes off the road. I was really frustrated by this point and just told him that wasn't very helpful advice anymore. He told me that if I was going to have an attitude he would talk to me later, but I was really angry and told him that he definitely wouldn't talk to me later and we hung up.

I later sent them both a message explaining that I wouldn't be home to visit that weekend as planned because I needed a weekend off and to please not try to contact me until the weekend was over. They never responded.

I called my mom today, and I guess my dad told her that I hung up on him and he won't speak to me until I apologize. My mom refuses to hear anything from me about it and is clearly very angry with me. There was no love in her voice. 

This is a common reaction from them whenever we have an argument. They yell at me or I get upset, then they invalidate any feelings I have and demand an apology. They've never once apologized to me for anything.

But this time I'm really angry. I understand that my dad was probably just worried about me, but the things he said really hurt me and were such a stark contrast to how supportive my friends and family at school have been. I honestly have no interest in apologizing to him, but my mom keeps telling me I have no right to feel angry and am completely in the wrong. 

I don't know what to do. Is she right? I know I could just suck it up and apologize to him and fix all of this, but I'm still really angry with him and am tired of this standard where they get to be awful to me and then I have to apologize to them.

Any advice anyone has would be so, so appreciated.

My father had a triple bypass surgery almost 10 years ago and refuses to eat red meats or anything high in cholesterol, fat, or salt. He says by doing this he eats healthy... but his diet is composed mainly of sugary snacks, pastries, cakes, chocolate, cookie, you name it. He eats very little protein (maybe half a chicken breast worth a day) and practically no vegetables. His sugar addiction is so bad that, when I was visiting around Christmas, I had some cookies in my room that my niece had made me (I was saving them) and he came in and ate them. If there is any kind of sugary treat near him he will eat it. And let's just ignore the fact for now that all those sugary pastries he eats are loaded with butter.

I've tried expressing that I'm worried about his sugar intake, about him developing diabetes, but he thinks he's too old to get diabetes. I also sent him a recent New York Times article on how sugar is bad for the heart, but I heard no response. His actions around the no red meat/fats issue makes me think he wants to preserve his health, but the sugar issue makes me think he doesn't care.

25889,Non-Romantic,2plopo,"I work in a job I very much like, but I have issues with my boss. She's a lifer here, and very well-connected so going up the chain of command is out of the question (others have tried countless times on a variety of issues with sexism, ageism, and a variety of other HR-related complaints that have gone nowhere). However, she shows a clear preference for male employees and tends to award them lots of privileges that I (and my female colleagues) do not enjoy.

Example: during certain times, we have a lot of overtime potential. Due to my status here (been around for a while, work my butt off, try to be agreeable in all things and always available to work no matter what), boss-lady has explicitly said that the goal is to get me as much of the OT as possible. However, when the rubber hits the road, I end up getting sent home and a male colleague (who started on the same day as I did, our position titles are the same, responsibilities the same, etc.) gets asked to stay. He gets first pick of schedules (she told me my new schedule recently and prefaced it by saying, Well, since Joe wants to come in at 8 am I'm going to need you to come in at 10 am...). As a consequence I end up with weird hours and not much in the way of OT. I have tried to very politely assert that I am open to the OT at all times, never ask for time off, and do not try to pit myself in opposition to my male colleague. This may sound like a brag, but I know that, as far as performance is concerned, we're equals.

Another issue is that she does not handle feedback well, so I fear that if I try to make it clear that I really want the OT and other perks that she's giving to my male counterpart, she will take it the wrong way. In the time I've been at this job I have seen many female workers get alienated, fired, or otherwise punished for simply telling the boss-lady what they want, or trying to get her to alter her behavior to be more accommodating (for example, she is downright biased against a female co-worker who is a new mom; boss-lady always says she doesn't want to promote her because she might get pregnant again).

Ultimately, I am looking for other options but I'm being picky because if I am going to switch jobs, I want the next step to be a good one. Perhaps it's best to knuckle under and take the de facto pay cut that comes with being passed over for the OT, but I hope there's a good way to address this problem without coming across as the sort of woman that boss-lady doesn't want to work with and will work to undermine.

25892,Non-Romantic,1qiez1,"My SO (26M) and I are super-good friends with two great people. We've often been there for each other when we need it the most, and while it's not a 100% free-information situation (we each have our secrets, stuff we don't want to talk about, past issues, etc.) I'm kind of confused about how to deal with this recent occurrence.

Male friend is one of my roommates, so I loaned him my laptop for message-checking stuff when his broke down. A few days ago, I hopped on to check my e-mail. I found a couple dozen messages from Female friend's address, all of which appeared very recent. I got kind of scared and worried, because she would never send this many e-mails all at once unless she was panicking over something. I opened up one, and found a series of nudes. I opened up another, and it was the same thing. My roommate heard me express my shock, and swore loudly. He'd forgotten to log out, and I'd opened up his emails by mistake.

He then revealed that he and Female friend have had a secret relationship for a few weeks. They've planned to tell me, but weren't sure if this would become a serious thing or not, so they hadn't yet. I'm fine with them having a relationship and exchanging photos (they're adults, it's cool), but he wants me to keep this totally secret - she can not know that I accidentally saw her nude photos, or that I now know about her and Male friend. He says it would ruin everything for them. Now, whenever I talk to her, it feels like a lie. I know that she's keeping a secret, and while she has every right to that, she has no idea that her secret's out. I feel like a terrible friend.

I've received a lot of conflicting advice - is it a terrible lie to just not talk about it? Why do I feel so bad about not telling her? This shouldn't be a big deal, but somehow I can't stop feeling bad about this.

I need some advice regarding my brother.

My parents paid for three years of my brother's schooling on the premise that he has to attend Cadet school. My brother has always hard trouble staying focused in school and in high school struggled a bit with achieving good grades. I think a problem with this is that he wanted to do fun things like hang out with his friends and play video games. Because of this my parents were hoping that the cadet will help him learn discipline and focus. Because of this my brother says he struggles with school and has been jumping around majors/etc.

First he said that he couldn't get into the engineering school when he applied and then would transfer as soon as he can after his first semester. To do this he said he had to take similar classes for engineering and then join. He said he struggled to reach the credits necessary due to cadets. 

Then after the first year he said he was going to do a major in plastics and still transfer into engineering. I never took it seriously because he's just a first year trying to figure out what he wants to do.

Then he said he couldn't get into engineering school so he was going to major in computer science. This was kind of my parents and my urging because a CS degree is great and I'm in the software field so I have a lot of connections and also see the value in a CS degree.

Turns out at the end of the last semester my Dad need his transcript and to our surprise it says his major is cinematography. My parents were very angry and not supportive. They said that he needs to pay for his own way especially because he lied all this time saying he was doing a CS or engineering degree. He cried and said he had failed a bunch of CS classes and so he was temporarily switching majors to bring back his GPA and pass the basic classes required to be a CS major. Then he would major in both CS and Cinematography. My parents were OK with that. My dad even said that he should follow his dream. Due to all the switching and not doing well in classes (I have no idea what his grades are and haven't seen his transcript nor has my parents) he has to attend school for another year. So five years (and he took summer classes his first/second year).

My parents ran into some money issues and so now I'm paying my brother's college. I wanted to find out what he was taking and talked to him today. He told me he was taking three CS classes and three cinema classes with 1 credit ROTC. He then says later that he dropped the CS class. I asked him what was his plan. He told me that he went to classes and realized that he was actually happy in the cinema classes and miserable in CS. That he didn't want to do CS. This was not what I agreed to pay for and what my parents paid for the last three years. 

I think it's perfectly fine to do cinematography IF he double majors and has a CS degree. I think a CS degree is nice to fall on and am being realistic that the competition is very high for the field he wants to be in. Why go to college and waste his five years? He doesn't even need to go to school if he wanted to pursue film or go to the school he went to. People can be immensely talented, but honestly it boils down to both talent, money, and luck…… I don't want him to end up at a  min wage job because he made bad decisions. I'm not trying to discourage his dream, but offer a alternate just in case it doesn't work out. He complained to me that I don't understand. The major classes are hard and the professors/TAs don't care. He struggles and no one helps him and he's not allowed to work with other students. (I take this with a grain of salt because I don't really believe it's true that it would be happening with ALL his classes).

He doesn't understand and I'm making his day bad by pressuring him. Of course I don't want to pressure him and told him that he honestly has to pay everything back if he can't major in both because there was stipulation that he would get a useful degree. Now I feel bad because I lashed out at him saying he's wasting our money, going to end up making coffee, and that everyone in life sucks up to do things they don't want and buckle down and study. That I studied through college and most days I don't want to work, but that's life and you have to make sacrifices especially to support yourself. 

I honestly feel super bad and he doesn't see our perspective and I can't see his. I don't want to ruin our friendship :C What can I do to knock some sense into him or to myself? My parents aren't happy either and are incredibly stressed as well. How do I approach the problem better and more calmly?

25897,Non-Romantic,2zx87x,"So me and my close friend are really into a special area of charity work. We've been good friends for about 5 years now, lived together for a few of them but now we're back with family. We graduated last year where I got a reasonably well paid job doing something different and he went into retail with his friend. His friend's shop shut down the other month, which he knew was going to happen, so he's been looking for other work. He's recently been offered a rare voluntary position with a small charity for a year (before you ask, yes it's legit) but it's overseas and he has to pay for travel, accommodation and food himself.

Here comes the annoyance: he had money saved up from his old job and still had a fair amount of it when he knew he was offered this position. He's fucking wasted it. He knew he'd have to pay for everything with this role but since then he's bought a new Apple Macbook, and keeps buying buttloads of games. He also bought a new giant TV before he was offered the role but he was pretty convinced he was gonna get it by that point. And now he's flat broke. So he's started asking people to donate money to the charity through him, as in *Send me money so I can help the charity by being there*. Everything he posts on all of his social-media now is a link to donate money, he's started messaging certain people directly (I've avoided that so far) and even created a group message on Facebook involving his entire friends list. I left this conversation immediately, knowing full-well what it was and what would happen later using the excuse I clicked the wrong button.

Now I'm all for people helping charities and supporting people to help charities. I've used a similar method in the past to raise money for something I've done but in no way did I abuse social media or waste my own money before asking for more. I just can't condone what he's doing. He's a very stubborn individual anyway and when he thinks something is right he's not going to listen to any objections. A perfect example of this when we lived together he was getting computer viruses all the time and I was constantly having to fix his laptop. He bought a brand new laptop every year because he abused them to death and blamed it on laptop's design. I told him to buy antivirus software but he thought it was a waste of money so refused. That's why he's bought an Apple Macbook, he heard they're harder to get viruses on; because why buy cheap antivirus software when you could just buy an expensive piece of hardware (and probably still ruin it)?

He's a great guy in so many aspects, I mean he generally cares about what this charity stands for and it will possibly kick-start his career where he can make a difference in the world. I want him to go there and do this but the idiot should have kept his money. He's never been good with money, we both used to be shopaholics back in the day but the difference is I came from rags so when my money ran out I realised I had to change whereas he came from riches so when his ran out he returned to the bank of mum &amp; dad then bought even more stuff. What do I say to him, he needs to realise but I don't want to upset him?

What's worse is he's been trying to ring me at the moment. He never rings me. We usually speak several times a day by text or meet up once a fortnight. I'm worried what he's going to say to me. He knows how much I earn and he's not been shy to let me pick up the bill before. Call me selfish but I'm saving for a property so me and my son can have our first house so I wouldn't want to give him much money, even if I didn't know about his purchasing history.

This is my first post. I'm not sure where else to go. I normally google my problems and try to find a solution, but I want opinions about my particular situation. Please. I'm sorry that its long. Even if i don't get any responses,I feel better writing about it. 

I recently got into a fight with my mom and its crossed over to my entire family. 
See I've had this thing (I'm too embarrassed to say, but i'm sure its possible to guess is correctly) that needed to be removed by the dermatologist. Needed, as in, one look from the derm. and she knew it possessed the possibility of causing a problems in the future. 
So, I got it removed.
But, see I'm embarrassed. I'm an only child in a single mother household. I understand that I had to basically raise myself because my mom needed to work for our survival. 
So I am a mommy's girl. We are close. I consider her my best friend. I'm home for summer vacation from college. Any chance I get to spend time with her, I take it. I always have. I've never care if that meant going to work with her and sleeping on the floor. I've never care in helping her clean or helping her with anything. I lover her. I know she's been through a lot. I've never complained because all I ever wanted was to spend time with her. 
But now, I'm 21. People always say I look like a 14 year old. I have a young face and I take advantage of that, because then I don't feel judged in public when we're hanging out.
(we own all 7 seasons of Gilmore Girls, btw) 
But on Monday, she took back what she said the previous meeting with the Derm.
The Derm. had asked if I was born with (its an ugly mole, fine I'll say it) and my mother said yes. She said my dad had a similar mole in the same spot. 
Now, this mole isn't visible, but I've always felt self conscious about it. I've told my mom this several times for the past 10 years. 
I also started to notice that the mole was growing and changing color. It passed the ABCDEs test. I told her this as well. But, my mom brushed it aside.
Look I understand why, she came from a village where doctors were rare so I know they learned to deal with pains and things differently or by just brushing them aside. 
So again, on Monday, she took back what she said the previous meeting with the Derm.
I should have let it go. I don't know why I didn't.
After the removal, I confronted her about this lie. To my surprise, she got angry. I didn't understand why. I didn't blame her for anything. Why would she take back what she had previously said. 
She went on about how she doesn't like me calling her liar, but I went on about how she was lying. (I'm stupid and need to grow up, yes I know. I'm trying, I'm doing it little by little.)
She then said she thought I was talking about another small mole but how is that possible when I've directly pointed at that the giant one and only spoken about that one. Theres no way. 
We ended up arguing and then not talking. 
I went to class (I'm taking a summer class at a community college). The day continue.
Later that night, she came up to me with food (she's a really good cook) and I'm stupid. 
I told her that I don't want to talk to her unless she's willing to admit she's wrong. (also, my aunt and my mom's new husband asked me how the removal went. I didn't even tell my best cousin. This was personal. I'm not even close to those 2 mentioned.) 
I also told her that it was rude to have told my aunt and her new husband this. 
She didn't respond. Look,  we ended up screaming at each other. Me, being an idiot for not letting it go. She wanted to let it go, but there have been some many times where she doesn't want to admit she's wrong and I end up have to take the blame. She ended up saying I'm the bad mother, yeah I'm that bad mother! 
I never said that. 
But, eventually, I did yell back if you want to believe that fine, but I never said that.
She left. 
I ate her food.
Contemplated getting drunk. I did't. Contemplated placing my arm on a hot pan. I didn't. 
She didn't come back until 11pm. I left. I took my backpack and suitcase (its small) and went out. I only went out to the back. She never came after me. I don't know why I thought she would. 
look I know I'm pathetic. I'm 21. I know. But I don't have any other support. Without my mom, I have nothing. I never had. I'm the Jon Snow of the family.
l stayed out there for an hour. Eventually got scared cause the lighting seem to be getting closer, so I went back inside. 
I was angry. 
So I decided to confront her. 
I kicked her bed until she finally woke up. She looked angry.
I asked her if she cared about me at all. She kept saying, don't make me angry, stop being annoying, let me sleep.
I kept insisting she answer. I asked her if she love me at all, if she cared. She kept saying, don't make me angry, I can get really angry. 
I kept insisting, like a child. She finally said what do you want to hear?! that I don't love you? okay, I don't. I don't care! I'm not going to answer your questions!
So I teared up a bit. I asked her, so you don't care if i die? if i never come back ? 
she said, you're 21, you can do whatever you want. Leave me alone, let me sleep!
She right, of course.

I left
went to go look for a motel. 
It was raining.
I found a motel; no vacancy.
I had nowhere to go.
I eventually ended up going back. 
She left at 7 am the next morning. (we are at her work)
I walked over to the library and stayed there all day. Went back later at night. (i cried a lot, instead of studying.) 
My mom wasn't staying there Tuesday. My aunt was. 
I got there around 10:40pm. i tried unlocking the door, but my aunt locked the top lock. I don't have a key for that. I heard her listening to music. I knock. The music stops, but she doesn't open the door.
I leave and walk to a motel. No vacancy. I try calling my mom. I must have called her about 30 times. I try calling her husband. They never answered. 
I go back. Instead of knocking, I pound on the door 2 times. (I know I shouldn't have)
My aunt gets up and asks whats going on? what do you want? I tell her are you going to open the door? 
She does. 
She yells what wrong with you PUTA!
I ignore and go to the living room, where my suitcase is.She follows. Starts telling me I need to respect my mom and her. I raise my voice. 
(I'm really quite and shy and have a really low self worth and self esteem, so I don't usually talk back or anything). We ended up yelling at each other. She kept saying (more like threatening) to call my mom. Okay? Do it. I don't care. What is she going to do? Punish me? She already told me to leave. She already told me she doesn't love me. Calling my mom for what? I'm 21. 
I told her to go ahead and call. She kept saying that S need to respect. I don't remember it all, but since I had called she son (my cousin and his sister are on my side...) he heard it all. I asked my aunt how she would feel if her youngest (who I love and babysit) was in my position. She turned my words around and said are you calling me a bad mother?! I'm not a bad mother! I never said that. 

Eventually her son came to pick me up. I explained. He told me his dad was angry at him for picking me up, threatening to take his and his sisters phone away.
Why? how in the world would he know if my cousins know my situation. I guess I'm just bad and they don't want me to get any help. What is it? 
I'm not doing drugs. I'm not on the streets. I don't steal. I don't ask for money. I loving babysitting their little girl. All I do is study. This one time, I decide to stand up for myself and now my family doesn't want to help me. 

Either way, my cousins and I text in group chats. Apparently, my other cousin talked to their dad this morning and he told her that I banged on the door and asked my aunt for my mom and that i said they were bad parents. I never did. My cousins, thank god, defended me. But I don't want them to suffer any more consequences because of me. 
So I've decided.
Once I got back to school, I'm not coming back home. I have a job up there (work study) I've save some money. I'll have to take out loans to pay for my last year, but I'm not coming back home. Everyone (I have a big family) thinks I'm like mentally ill. Or worse, that i am my father's daughter. (he he physically abused my mother). 
But I can't support my self and I still have a month here.
I don't know how to deal with this. Should I apologize? 
I don't want to, but things won't back to the way they were. How can they, when now my family has this picture of me due to my aunts words. I bet she painted me as a monster. What do i do? please.

25909,Non-Romantic,36pw23,"I’ve come to reddit on a throwaway because I need help and I don’t really know who else to talk. I’ve been with my girlfriend for 3 years and I truly love her, everything has been great between us and we have no issues whatsoever. Her parents are divorced and her father is in serious debt. I knew that her father has had a drinking problem but that was about it. Her mother works nonstop, literally every single day with 14 hour shifts and recently broke up with her boyfriend. But she’s always been nice and I would have never expected anything from her after going to dinners, Easter, Christmas, etc.


This week my girlfriend told me that she’s in a fight with her mother so I thought nothing of it and was supportive and just passed it off as a simple fight. Now today she broke down… Apparently she didn’t ever tell me about how mean her mother has been to her entire life and how she’s blamed my girlfriend for everything in her life. She’s been kicked out of her house 4 times and once ended up in the hospital (I just learned this). Her mother is blaming her for the break up, ruining her life, being useless, and that she should forget her dad. At one point she was also threated with a knife (A while ago).


I did everything I could, I tried to reassure her that things will get better and that her mother is taking out all her anger, issues, and nonstop working on her. But that didn’t help. My girlfriend blames herself and has so much guilt built up. To her, the future will basically be taking care of both her parents (Paying off huge debt) with the added guilt that everything is her fault. She doesn’t believe me when I say things will get better and it’s tearing me apart knowing she’s in so much pain and I can’t help her.


I love my girlfriend very much and I’ve known for a while that someday I’ll marry her but I don’t want her to think that the future is bleak and hopeless. I don’t know what to say or do to make things better and give her hope. So I don’t really know what I’m looking for reddit, advice? Comments? Suggestions? I was just hoping I could get some advice.

25913,Non-Romantic,3atjac,"Every time I see my phone ringing and one of my parents call, I get agitated, instantly. It doesn't have to be anything serious, it doesn't have to do with any specific topic, it just makes me anxious. 

For example...yesterday, my father was supposed to do me a small favor, ride down to DMV and get some papers for me, since I live 50 miles away from that DMV and don't have time due to work. 

But, like he always does, he called me before and after, 2 times, and then I put my phone on silent because I wanted to spare myself another one of his calls...

I forgot to turn silent off, I woke up today, see couple of his missed calls. My morning is immediately ruined. I decide to call him to get that out of the way. I call him, he answers with Im about to give you a lecture voice and then he starts going...I did this for you, I didnt have to, I called you because I needed to ask you one thing but you didnt answer, you could've answered back...etc etc etc

I resisted the urge to smash my phone into the wall and the call ended on a sour note, as usual. 

In contrast to that story, my mom and dad live in the same house but separate floors, they don't talk to one another, they wanted to get divorced but didn't, whenever I go over to visit it's this weird tension in the air, the snide remarks they say about one another are getting on my nerves and most of all, I hate this blame game they love to play.

One small example, half of the house they live in is unfinished. It's been like that for 10 years. My father didn't want no contractors/workers there, he said he'll do it all by himself. But, he didn't.

But - couple of months ago, some friend of his call him to help him doing furniture for his home. My dad, naturally, jumped right over there. He worked there with that guy, for months. I asked him is he getting any money for it, he went into I'm offended mode immediately.

Because, according to him, that's his super bestie friend.

Couple of days ago he called me and told me that his super bestie friend played him and that he doesn't want to pay him. LOL. Things like this happened to my father approximately one trillion times (that I'm aware of) in my lifetime.

It's always some obscure friend in need of some free help, my father the Great Martyr and Great Friend offers to help, and gets sour at the end of it and never speaks to that guy again. I've seen it millions of times.

But when it comes to going to the DMV, it's absolutely important to emphasize the sacrifice like he did to me over the phone.

My dad was a great dad when I was younger &amp; have TONS of fond memories. When I was about 15 years old, my dad took over an uncle's business. He also started an affair with a co-worker/family friend's wife at that time. We never had money &amp; in retrospect it was probably because he was helping his 'friend' out all the time. He also started heavily drinking. After that, there was also cheating from my mom's end but that was near the end of their relationship &amp; I suspect my mom found someone else just to get away from the craziness at home.

From the time that I was 15, my dad started becoming abusive towards my siblings [all younger than me], mother, &amp; me.

Example: It just kept escalating until one night when I was 18, my mom became terrified of my dad &amp; locked him out before he could come home from 'work' (it was his excuse to be out &amp; drink/cheat). Throughout the night while my siblings &amp; I attempted to sleep, we would hear him through the answering machine that she needed to let him in because he was going to kill her but that it'd be okay because of course he would not hurt his own kids. He would repeat this in a cheery voice. The night ended with me locking some of my siblings &amp; mother in my upstairs bedroom with my skeleton key &amp; running out of the house barefoot, at 3 a.m. on a Thursday night, attempting to call the cops, while my dad broke his bedroom window with his bare hands yelling for my mother. He bled all over the house &amp; the cops ended up dragging him out of the basement. When he got out of jail, he came home &amp; spewed more abuse to everyone saying that it was our fault we had no money because he missed an opportunity to go work because of us. Again, there were a few sleepless nights like this.

After this incident, I had to speak with my dad &amp; tell him he wasn't welcome anymore. It was heartbreaking to tell my dad that he had to go &amp; to see him just walk out the door to no where. I know he terrorized us but it still hurt to do. He agreed to keep a roof over our heads by paying the rent. In two months, we were evicted out of our rental home &amp; he just shrugged his shoulders when we told him.

We moved in with my mom's boyfriend. There were 8 of us in a one bedroom, one bath. Things were still way better. We could actually be relaxed in our home &amp; we didn't have to over analyze every single word we said so we wouldn't be punched. We slowly moved up &amp; improved our situation.

We get better &amp; he gets worse. He keeps drinking. He comes around asking for money all the time. I have really no savings from turning them all over to him. He promises over &amp; over he'll get help but he just needs a few more dollars and then he'll be able to. He now has a two year old with another lady. He got a DUI last year. He lost his job because of it. His good paying job where he was able to get insurance for us &amp; all of his kids. He wasn't paying child support but told my mom that the least he could do was get insurance for us. He sounded proud that he could at least do that.

He landed in the hospital after a car fell on him at work earlier this year &amp; I thought we'd finally convinced him to get help &amp; he sounded gung ho about it. Turns out he was excited about the easy money he thought he'd get from the accident from his employer. His BAC came back &amp; workers comp found him culpable since it was so high that he didn't get shit.

We're now looking to buy our first home &amp; closing date is Sept. 24th! We're so excited! My mom got remarried. I'm back in school. But he makes me feel so guilty.

For example: Today he wanted to take out a title loan on his truck &amp; needed someone to co-sign. I refused because of the home closing &amp; told him that it was also because he's a POS with paying back loans (this past year my family has 'loaned' him $6,000+). He asked me for $100. Told him I don't have it because I really don't. I then told him that he needed to get out on his own &amp; move out of the house his baby momma owns because he's paying 3x what this house's rent is really worth plus child support. While I was telling him he should get an apartment &amp; live within his means, he started ranting that no one helps him. Everyone helps each other except him &amp; that he's all alone. He then started ranting about how we only wanted to deal with him when he had insurance for us &amp; that I wasn't even grateful enough to use it or get my teeth fixed (there's no need for my teeth to be fixed. They're fine. I'm sorry I was so busy with work that I couldn't afford taking a day of to visit the dentist. Or copays). He started climbing into his car still ranting &amp; left me standing in the street talking to myself.

I don't know what to do. In the past year we've said that we would help him if he would move out of that home that he can't afford, if he'd at least go to AA, or somehow try to improve his situation. He says he will move out but that he has no money to move out. We bought him a storage unit so that he'd be able to but it always ends up being that he can now afford to live there so he never moves out. It's very frustrating. I cry all the time because most of the time that he calls me, I know it's for money.

Thank you for reading this. I just want to know how I should proceed &amp; don't know how to do it. I don't really know what normal is :(

Little backstory. My parents have been married for almost 15 years. Since then my dad has gotten pretty overweight but it doesn't seem to bother my mom much.
My dad owns a PC store,and his only employee is my mom,meaning she's the only reason he doesn't have to wake up at 7 AM and gets to sleep as much as he wants.

For as long as I can remember,they have been fighting over such meaningless things that it seems like a joke even talking about it.
But it isn't your usual 2 minute argument about why she paid too much for some stake. This stuff lasts for hours. 

**Example 1** : They're both drilling holes in the wall for some random idea my dad had. He tells her to mark 3 holes in given areas. She misses one as he watches. They finish and he notices she missplaced one mark.Mind you,these are just marks,not even drilled yet. He starts calling her retarded,telling her she should get some help and go and pray in a church for herself (?) . Half an hour ago she was telling him how awful her day was and how she was very tired. She then tries to chill out by watching some TV as he comes and throws even more insults at her.

**Example 2** : This one tends to happen once or twice a week. It usually starts by them having coffee together and talking about money/business. And no surprise he always manages to  turn the conversation around to telling her how she is useless,she doesn't have a real job (seriously?) ang in general degrading her existence. Yelling intensifies. Mom breaks down. Degrading intensifies. They pause for 5-10 minutes and he casually brings it up again. Rinse and repeat for the next hour.

There are many more examples but I feel this gives you the general idea of why anyone in their right mind would hope on their parents' divorce. If someone doesn't get the idea I can edit the post with more examples. Also,it's worth to mention that my mom is mostly right in these arguments,but he seems to love arguing even though he is obviously wrong and there is no point. It just seems it would be better for everyone if they divorced,I don't think my mom can take any more of that.

25968,Non-Romantic,3i142s,"I'll try to be as objective as I can be.  I'm a bit sleep deprived, though, so I apologize if this comes out weird.  Some background:  I've been living in the house for about 4 years, with Amy(37F(ish)), another housemate, who is also owner and landlord.  Amy travels a lot and is home roughly 50% of the time (not sure if this will be relevant).  Joe moved in about 5 months ago. We all have separate rooms.  Amy's is the master bedroom, which is next to Joe's room, which is next to my room.  

The house is a 1-story in a tropical climate, so no insulation, no sound dampening, paper-thin walls, and the windows are all open all the time.  This means you can pretty much hear the neighbors doing dishes as if they were in your own kitchen, but the neighborhood's pretty quiet overall, so that's not really an issue.  Amy and I are pretty laid back, and when home, we both tend to do our own thing and keep to ourselves.

When Joe moved in, it was with the understanding that it wasn't a party house, we were both quiet people and enjoyed a quiet house.  He had no problems with this at the time, so we were looking forward to our new housemate, as I honestly like the guy.  He's a good conversationalist and has a very entertaining perspective on various issues.  

However, problems arose almost immediately.  Basically, Joe doesn't quite know how to be quiet.  

* When it comes to closing doors, he doesn't seem to grasp that a door doesn't need to be closed with force if you just turn the handle.  Due to the construction of the house, whenever he closes a door, everyone can hear it.  I can even feel it in my bed, since it's touching a wall.

* Joe doesn't seem to understand when his TV is too loud.  This would be understandable if we hadn't told him on multiple occasions exactly when his TV was too loud.

* Joe doesn't have headphones.  He listens to music on his phone speaker on full blast wherever he is in the house.  Including, on occasion, competing with his TV speakers in his room.

* The big one:  Joe likes to go out and party on weekends.  I have no problem with this, and totally understand.  However, Joe likes to bring home random hookups anywhere between 1 and 4 am, then have very loud sex with them in his room (next door to mine).  I have multiple problems with this.  First and foremost, I'm trying to sleep.  midnight-5 AM should seriously be common sense quiet times in a house that you share with others, especially others with odd schedules, like myself and Amy.  Second, and call me whatever you like on this one, I get very uncomfortable about being in clear earshot of people having sex (at least in the case of making no attempt to be quiet about it).

Amy and I have talked with Joe multiple times about these issues, except for explicitly stating the very audible sex.  We phrased that as Making entirely too much noise at unreasonable hours, as the sex was also accompanied by noisy house entry, loud conversation with the hookup du jour, obligatory door slamming, and possibly a loud TV.  We figured that was enough said.

He did get a bit better, but the loud post-bar hookups were still happening on a weekly to bi-weekly basis, and last night's was when I couldn't handle it anymore.  I'm about 2 weeks in to a new job with a VERY demanding schedule, and last night, I'd gotten home after about 16 hours of work at around 2am.  I had just enough time to get about 6 hours of sleep before I had to go back this morning.  Around 4AM, drunk Joe stumbles in to the house with a random and wakes me up.  Then, they proceed to have loud sex for the next half hour-45 min.  At this point, sleep for me is screwed.  Not only have I been woken up, but I'm extremely angry about this fact, and I'm too worked up to get back to sleep.

I was a freshman in high school more than a decade ago when my father was arrested and convicted on child molestation charges. I don't know that much about what actually happened. I know that he plead guilty to some of it and not guilty to other charges. I know that it didn't involve myself or my younger brother. I don't know how much I want to know.

It turned my life upside down. They say that everyone comes to a point in their growing up when they realize that their parents are fallible. This was mine. Watching police officers tear our house apart and walk out with every photograph, video tape, camera, and computer in our house while they made snide comments about my family in I'm pretending they can't hear this, but I intend them to voices.

It was plastered all over the news (which I was not allowed to watch until everything blew over). At school, people pointed and whispered about me. People abruptly stopped talking to me. My locker was vandalized. People that I had been friends with since I was an infant told me My parents said I'm not allowed to hang out with you anymore. I was a pariah. I was desperate for any sort of positive relationship, so I clung to the few teachers who didn't hold me at arm's length. I became not only the kid-fucker's daughter, but a teacher's pet.

I went through high school like a pilot fish - clinging to the edges of any social group that would tolerate me for a lunch period. When they eventually shooed me away, I'd find someone else whose first instinct was just to ignore me rather than tell me to get bent.

I was determined to have the high school experience. I went to every dance and stood in the corner by myself. I went to every football game and did all the cheers from the stands because the cheerleading squad wouldn't have me. I joined non-team sports and practiced by myself. I joined the biggest club that I could so that I could be isolated and still pretend to be a part of a group. I went on field trips and slept on hotel room floors because none of the other girls would consent to share a bed with me.

I had one romantic relationship. He came from a similar family background and we were mutually understanding. That ended two years ago when he told me that he had come to the realization that he was gay and had been sleeping with his male roommate.

I still don't make friends. I don't go on dates. My first thought in approaching anyone to build any sort of relationship is Eventually I'll have to tell this person about my father, and then they'll stop talking to me.

When the idea of a romantic relationship comes up, it brings the thought of children. Do I have kids? What would I tell them about their grandfather? Would he be able to see them? Would I want him to see them? Would my husband?

My mother tried to hold the family together, at first. We visited him in prison, driving for hours to sleep in a line in a parking lot with the hope that we'd be given a visitor's pass rather than have to drive home because they didn't have room for us. She bought him packages. There were phone calls and letters.

That fell apart. My mom had an affair, got a divorce, and remarried. My brother cut off all contact with my dad. When it came to my father, I was left holding the reins. The letters and phone calls are directly to me, now. I'm constantly aware that I'm the only connection he has to the outside world. 

There was a time when I was gaining distance from the situation. I was focused on finishing school so that I could become gainfully employed. My capacity to build relationships was still fucked. I was lonely, but I didn't spend every waking moment focused on my dad.

Then I got a letter from him. He felt like he'd been abandoned. He worried that when he got released and got off the bus, all that would be waiting for him was the sidewalk. I felt horrible. I started sending letters back and forth with him again. I got a job, and he started sending me package order forms. I started buying them.

That's how it goes now. I get a letter every now and again. It usually goes something like Here's why everyone is going to Hell. Buy me coffee. When he was booked, he immediately found God, who in his infinite wisdom seems to change how he feels about humanity and what he wants from us on a weekly basis. But coffee and hot sauce and peanut M&amp;Ms are a constant.

I don't mind buying packages, if for no other reason than that it keeps my guilt at bay. $200 four times a year is a small price to pay for peace of mind.

What terrifies me, as it gets closer and closer, is his release date. I don't know what he expects of me, but it seems to be a lot. He talks about how he'll be old and retired, but there's no money in his savings. It was taken for reparations that still aren't completely paid off. He'll have nowhere to live, no car, no job, no driver's license, no internet access, no prospects. He's never had a cell phone. He doesn't understand social media or wifi or bluetooth, and the fact that there's a backup camera in my car amazes him. 

I feel he expects me to support him when he's released, and I don't think I can. I'm terrified as it is that someone at work will find out that I'm supporting or related to a child molester. I'm an elementary school teacher, and there are times where I wait for a crazed parent to come in and demand my job and ruin any future prospects for the same. Beyond that, I can't financially support or run errands for two households.

I've started having a recurring dream where my father dies in prison before his release, and it always makes me incredibly relieved. Then I wake up and feel so guilty that I vomit. On the flip side, I have nightmares where I'm taking him groceries and I get murdered by the lynch mob assembled outside of his house. At least those don't make me feel like a horrible person.

I have nobody to talk to about this. I was feeling particularly open with my mother a week or so ago and told her all of this. Her response was to tell me how terrible their marriage had been (including a slew of things I didn't know and didn't want to know - he was a womanizer, had a porn addiction, neglected her, etc, etc, etc), how she had only suffered through it because of myself and my brother, and how she was glad that she didn't have to deal with it anymore. It wasn't very constructive.

I can see no life for myself which isn't totally dictated by my father's transgressions. I have no idea how to balance my sense of obligation to my parent and my need to live for myself.

TL;DR - My dad went to prison a long time ago. He's getting nearer his release date, and he seems to expect me to support him. His conviction dictates my life, and I have no idea what to do about it.",I [26f] am dreading the day that my [55m] father gets released from prison.,0.0,False,406.0,69.0,1437105698.0,/r/relationships/comments/3dl62a/i_26f_am_dreading_the_day_that_my_55m_father_gets/,NonRomantic
25984,Non-Romantic,2hjksu,"I still live at home, and won't be able to move out for a while. I've also recently moved back home after figuring out really fast that I can't do the whole dorm thing. Now that I'm back at home, I've realized how crazy my sister seems to be.


I've noticed it before, in small amounts, from time to time, but lately it's like a constant thing. Let me give an example from today.


We all share a shower, there's only one bathroom in our house. Sister has crazy long, thick hair, and often leaves it on the shower wall and in the drain. Mother is tired of cleaning up hair, tells both of us we need to clean up after ourselves. I say sure, as I already make it a point to clean out the drain after my showers. Sister starts hollering that it's not her hair and so no, she won't do anything.


I'm not really very patient when people are lying about me, so instead of just keeping my annoyance with that to myself, I tell her to own up to her messes and stop placing blame on me when she forgets to do something. Mom goes into bathroom, closes door, no longer can hear this next bit. Once mom can't hear, my sister comes to my room, and starts shouting that I'm nuts and need to not lie and stop lying you crazy bitch (all said to me).


Eventually I realize she'll stop shouting hurtful things if I stop saying that I'm not the one lying, and put in my headphones and wait til it's over.


It's getting to the point where I feel like I'm being emotionally abused. I'm not sure what's wrong with her, this happens for issues ranging from things that are obvious lies (she brews tea in little pods every few days, I don't drink her tea, just use the teabags, she blames the dirty pods on me) or (she sees that her bed is messy, claims I slept in it, screams until my mom makes her stop). To things like this that no one can really determine who is lying (except I have almost invisibly thin hair and she has super thick hair...the hair on the wall was course and thick). I don't know what to do. Sometimes I worry she'll get violent, as she has in the past when she gets worked up about things.


I know nothing about mental disorders that may cause this, but she refuses every time my mother suggests she see a therapist. What can I do to make this house less of a scary and uncomfortable place to live in? What can be done about people who are pathological liars? How do I at least stop feeling abused?


Oh also! She bounces between angry and the above behavior to let's go get coffee together :D :D :D really fast. As part of my dealing with her angry moods, should I not play into the happy ones? :/ (oftentimes when I do, like today, she'll turn on me really quick and change her mind)

25986,Non-Romantic,2wvtjr,"So, I have a friend I love to pieces. She has some mental health issues and my understanding is she's on medications for bi-polar disorder. She also has extremely low self-esteem and has been suicidal frequently in the past. When I say extremely low self-esteem, I mean she has trouble figuring out why anyone would appreciate her and feels she's of no value to anyone as a human being.  

As such, every time she gets freaked out or gets maudlin about her money situation, she automatically assumes anything I say is slagging her for being irresponsible and stupid. 

*No matter what I say* in response to her commentary, she retorts snidely that I'm making her feel like a piece of shit and I'm essentially calling her the world's most irresponsible human being. 

This baffles me, because I don't think anything of the sort about her. I admit that my personality tends toward tough love conversations and I'm someone who problem-solves, but since prior conversations in that spirit have turned ugly, I've backed way off and only say things like, Well, planning for a excitement purchase and saving is a way to get around feeling like you can't have all the things! as a means of help and support. 

She still is adamant that I'm just an asshole who is rubbing her nose in her inability to take care of herself, because if I didn't feel that way, I wouldn't think she's too stupid to know she needs to save money.   

What? Seriously? Where are you even getting that from what I said? I just *cannot*, man. I can't. 

Honestly, it's affecting our relationship to the point I can't take it any more. I'm confident that my personality makes it clear that sly and sneaky insults just aren't my style; I'm the pin-up girl for frontal assault when it comes to disagreements. I'm also slightly insulted she thinks I'd ever feel that way about her, and she should know me better than that. I'm ALSO also confident that in no way do my words convey such a feeling at *all* and I'm boggled by her insistence they do. I feel like she's putting words in my mouth (so to speak) and is purposefully misunderstanding my phrasing and intentions, by way of over-reacting.  

How do I get past this with her? I don't want to lose a friend but at the same time I just can't handle being told I'm vicious and nasty when that's in no way, shape or form my intent and nothing I communicate to her by way of apology/correcting the misunderstanding makes the situation better.

Sometimes he has no control over his emotions when he drinks. When he is sober and bored it's like he doesn't know what to do with himself, and wants to get high or drunk.

It's getting to the point where I feel guilty if I don't want to hang out with him because he doesn't have many friends. I see him from the time he wakes up until he falls asleep. We work together and he sleeps over all the time. I wish he would branch out and find himself. 

He is a nice guy and will buy things for everyone to have a good time.  Sometimes when someone doesn't seem appreciative or doesn't show some excitement, it bothers him.  He'll say these things like, Nobody loves me. Fuck you. I'm a piece of shit.  We all say we love him and he is not alone. It's hard to reach out to him when he is like this.


I'm always by his side trying to be a good friend. It's sad to know I am one of the few he has. I tried telling him maybe he should see a doctor about depression. He's been getting worse over the past years I've been hanging out with him.

I do have a boyfriend, but I have to work 10x harder the entire week for that one day with him for a couple hours. Even then I'm still doing work and neglecting my guest. 

I know that might not seem much, but if you see my chore list, on top of having to go above and beyond, you'd understand. 

Oh, which reminds me. Since I'm the only one that cleans the house (younger sister has mental issues, doesn't help) if she gets pissed off, she'll cut down everything I do.

I also work 73.5 hours a week for her. I do not get paid. I am paid biweekly. She keeps the money and uses it how she sees fit. The deal was I would give her 1 check, I would get the either.

I'm not some teen that has the good life and is just being a spoiled brat. She is controlling of everything. Like, I'm not allowed to leave/move out until I'm 25. I'm not allowed to get married. I'm not allowed to have sex (that part I understand, but even if I'm alone with my boyfriend, I'm accused of doing things I don't do.)

I had the misfortune of living with him for six months when my husband and I had been dating for a couple of years and moved in with his mom after she swore up and down that his brother would not be living with us. He was there within a week. Within a few months he had stolen from me, violently attacked my husband (then boyfriend) and caused all sorts of drama of the variety only tweekers seem to know how to manifest in their lives and the lives of those close to them. I watched him go to jail, rehab, have stints of being homeless. My husband's mom would get very angry, and then she would go rescue him. Every. Single. Time. I packed up and moved. My husband followed and we got on with our lives. His brother went to jail for a long time and his mom moved across the country. Fast forward a year later and he is living with her again. 


At one point, he got a woman pregnant and married her. We actually thought he had finally turned his life around and was going to stay clean. His wife had their baby, his warrants caught up with him, and she kicked him out and took their kid to another country and cut off all contact with him and the whole family (can't say I blame her). 


Shortly after that, he blew up at me when I refused to deliver a message to his ex-wife. He cussed me out and I told him I hope this was worth it, you little shit, because I'm done helping you. I haven't spoken to him since. That was four years ago. i had spent hours talking to parole officers, lawyers, advocating for him, sending him money in jail. It just finally dawned on me that he was never going to change and that no one could help him but him. I also will not tolerate abusive behavior in my life. He has tried many times to get back into contact with me and I have never responded. I've also asked my husband not to share with me when he does something - but I can always tell because my husband gets very upset so it comes out anyway. 


A few days before our son was born, BIL attacked my MIL and FIL and nearly killed them. Literally tried to strangle my FIL to death and threatened to stab him the chest. They called 911 and barricaded themselves in a bedroom while he ransacked the house, all the time screaming that he wanted to go to jail. Then he disappeared. My MIL got a protective order and swore up and down she was done with him. I knew better than to believe it, but I did send her some resources for AL-Anon and asked her to go get some support. 


Meanwhile, we find ourselves in a quandry. I am going back to work in a week and a half and because of my maternity leave, we have a bit of catching up to do financially. We bought a plane ticket for my MIL, who agreed to come out for a few weeks to bond with our baby and provide childcare while I get a few paychecks in the bank so that we can pay for childcare after she leaves. I knew we were taking a risk by doing this, but my hope was that she could just forget about the drama for a while and realize how awesome life can be when you're not constantly focusing on one addict's infinite issues. 


I called her today and she was crying. She said that my BIL had stranded himself in the middle of nowhere and she had gone and gotten him last week and given him some money, and now he was homeless and she didn't know what to do. I told her Why don't you stop enabling him and let him suffer the consequences of his actions for once? I got off the phone quickly before I started yelling. Then I called my husband and said I was ready to cancel her plane ticket. She is so mired in this drama. I don't want it around our child and I don't want to run the risk of this violent junkie showing up on my doorstep. He has caused physical harm to my husband and nothing seems to be enough for her to stop rescuing him. I will not allow my child to be hurt by this as well. I honestly would divorce my husband rather than to allow his brother anywhere near me or my child. 


So what do I do, Reddit? Do I lower the boom on her and suffer the potential fallout with my husband? He claims he doesn't want the drama either but he doesn't know what to do. All of this just gives him severe anxiety. I know I'm probably going to end up looking like the evil bitch if I bring the hammer down and cancel the plane ticket, but I feel like nothing else will get through to her and she's too engrossed in the drama to provide adequate care for our son. 

TL;DR: MIL is flying out next weekend to provide three weeks of care for our baby boy. Tweeker BIL is causing nonstop drama, worried it will follow her to our house.

26017,Non-Romantic,2b4yec,"Just moved to a new city, met some really wonderful people through mutual friends who live near me. Me and my girl mentioned we were going on vacation and were trying to figure out what to do with our cats.

They jumped on the offer. They said they've been thinking of getting cats and would love to spend some time with them to see if it would be a good fit for them. We agreed.

They sent us a really sweet email to update us on how they were, saying they were fine and they loved spending time with them.

Come back yesterday to a wonderful letter thanking us for letting them spend time with them on top of a six-pack of expensive beer. Crazy nice.

One of our cats is just fine, but the other was really sluggish when we got home. He was kind of groaning, howling, seemed uncomfortable.

We let him sleep with us during the night, thinking he was just suffering from seperation anxiety (he's a really needy cat) and he woke us up puking right in bed between us.

Ever since he's been propping himself up in strange positions. It seems like abdominal discomfort, but he doesn't seem to have any sharp pains anywhere as I applied light pressure to numerous places on his stomach and body and he didn't react.

I'm taking him to the vet today, hoping he's just constipated or something. 

But I don't know how to handle the friends who took care of them. I trust this probably isn't their fault, but if they ask, I just don't know what to say if they ask about them, or if I should thank them.

We were going to give them a large sum of cash and some gifts from our vacation, but I don't know if it's appropriate now.

Any thoughts?

All this happened the last time my cousins spent the night, and it got brought up 2 weeks after the sleepover. My aunt *Sophie accused me of telling my cousin[8 F] *Kayla how babies were made. Thing is, I didn't. I don't know who did, (although I suspect my grandmother [56 F], because she can be manipulative and has done similar things in the past,) and I've told Sophie that it wasn't me, but she just doesn't believe me. For a while, my own mother [36 F] didn't believe me. She decided I must be telling the truth after Sophie accused her of something along those lines. I have no idea why Kayla isn't speaking up about this, I assume she might be scared. I'm not allowed to see her or her siblings anymore because of all this drama Sophie has created. When this first happened, a year ago, Sophie said she wanted to work things out. She hasn't even tried to reach out to us or fix this problem. I've called her, asking her to call me back, but she never does. I love my cousins, and I want to be able to see them again.

26065,Non-Romantic,2im0ym,"Throwaway because he's frequently on this sub. 

I've known my bestfriend for a little under ten years; we started college together, are both film nerds and bonded very quickly. Fast forward to the present- I'm getting married to a wonderful guy (yay!) next fall, and we've all become incredibly close. My guy (28/m) and my bestfriend also became best friends- pretty much over the last 2 years it's been myself, my duder, and bestfriend (BFFLZ as now referred), featuring whatever girl he's trying to get down with. My guy and BFFLZ became very,very good friends, which was awesome! Who doesn't love mutual friendship?

(I apologize if this gets wordy, it's a strange story but imperative to understand why I'm so hurt/confused about this situation.)

BFFLZ has always had an addiction towards 'love'- he falls fast, and hard, but gets bored after 3 months, and inevitably breaks the heart of the girl he's currently toying with. (I also worry he may be a sex addict, but that's an entirely different post.) Over the course of our friendship, he's probably been in about 20 different 'relationships' that all end up like this. Wash, rinse, repeat the same cycle over and over. It never bothered me because he was at least honest about his intentions, and when he asked for advice, I was honest- it wasn't fair to the girls he was seeing, or himself. This all changed for the worse last week. 

My guy has an incredibly hostile, toxic ex-girlfriend that has been filtering in and out of our lives since the beginning of our relationship. (She stole money from him, ruined his relationship with many of their mutual friends, cheated consistently, compulsively lied about way too many things, and treated him like a dog in the five years they dated.) It started with her sitting in my seat at a wedding reception that I was invited to as his plus-one that they both were in attendance for- refusing to move (so classy, right? THERE ARE SEATING ARRANGEMENTS FOR A REASON!), and escalated to frequent phone calls crying about how she missed him, showing up and harassing us at bars, getting in my face and telling me horrendous things, etc. My BFFLZ saw all of this behavior exhibited by toxic ex-girlfriend in person, and thought it was disgusting and pathetic.



Well, apparently he was only disgusted by this behavior for a little under 6 months, because now they're an 'item' (how they 'accidentally' met is still a mystery to me). He didn't have the gall to tell me himself, and my guy is furious- this is the basics of bro code! You don't date your good friends' ex unless explicit permission is given! Or so I thought it my naive, loyalty based friendship-mantra. 

So instead of telling me, he blocks me on all social media, and posts some truly awful things about how I'm 'childish' for not supporting his choices, and 'petty' for ending a friendship over someone I dislike. The funny part is that I never said anything to him along the lines of those things- I never had a chance to say *anything* to him, because he refuses to return my calls, or messages. Instead his will only message my guy to tell him what a bitch I am, and apparently someone prank called him 50 times at 1am last night, which obviously was me, even though I had work at 4am this morning. /s He's convinced I did all these awful things, but he refuses to have a conversation with me.

I've reached out and expressed how sad I am about him doing all these things, and how that even though I dislike the person he's involved with, I will give her a chance because he apparently 'really cares about her, and she's changed'. Of course, I received no response. 

I'm stunned at BFFLZ behavior, and devastated that he would completely throw away our friendship over someone he's been seeing for two weeks. 

At this point, I don't know if I should attempt to amend this friendship, or just cut my losses. I've been an emotional mess all day (he was supposed to be my guy's best man in our wedding), and feel completely heartbroken over the loss of someone I loved like a brother. All of our mutual friends are astounded at this turn of events as well. I'm at a complete loss of how to react at this point. I'm half a bottle deep of red wine, and trying not to cry my eyes out, because BFFLZ would be the one I'd talk to in a situation like this.

To try, or to abandon, and let fate run its course?

EDIT: I'm also fairly convinced he also has a severe cocaine addiction as well. He quit his job as a school teacher, lost 100lbs within the past few months (claiming it was from 'quitting drinking', dude, you'd have to be drinking 40,000 calories a day in beer and then stop to lose a 100lbs in less than 4 months), and now bartends at a dive bar.
