56730,Breakups,2co7og,"Backstory: I was with Amanda since the end of 2009. She was my first real long term girlfriend, for her I was the second (3 years with another guy before). She lives at 400km from me. So the first year we decide to go to Canada to study one year and we live together half time in montr√©al for me and halftime in Ottawa for her. It was for her and for me the best year of our lifes. After that we have some difficulties, because she was jealous, but on the other hand she was attracted by this type of guys who go out with theirs friends and drink and... 

Anyway after 3 years I stop telling her that I was loving her, I have no trust in her and she doesn't care because for her it was my problem to trust her. It was very difficult because I was in Mexico for 7 months and she was with his new BFF (a whore) and was going to the club every week (she wasn't before and forbid it to me before). She tells me that she wasn't doing anything wrong and it was (almost sure) true, she says that she was living through her friends who was single.

After coming back from mexico earlier than expected because of her (but she doesn't know that) I try to move in with her in her appartment, she was OK but she behaved like it wasn't a big deal. I doesn't feel at home so finally I stay at my town. 2 month later after a very nice week end with her in my family I say to her that it was not possible for me anymore, I was giving a lot and not receiving anything in return and that I don't see a future with her so we take a pause.

After one month to think about our relationship, I understood that I was hurting her a lot and it was not the first time, I was not here for her and she was in a lot of pain (I already make a pause 3 times before...) and I understand that you don't have to wait for the other to change but you can only work on yourself. I was thinking about all the moment incredible we lived the past 4 years and I become for the first time since 3 years that she was the one for me. Sadly two days after, I receive an e-mail from her saying that she finally came at the same conclusion than me that it's a good thing to break-up. I was shattered, I try to go to her appartment, she was doing a big party with her friends. She didn't want to see me but I stay and party with them and sleep (no sex no nothing) with her. She was totally drunk she was saying that she was single that she can do what she wants. She takes a panic crisis and we cry a lot together but in the morning she says that this was the right call and I have to go back to my home (400km away).

Two days after I was that we belong together because during this party I see the changes and I was sure about the end of our problem. So I try to call her three days after, it was impossible not to call her, I couldn't eat anymore, I couldn't work anymore. She says that I have to stop doing that (i know that it wasn't the good thing to do but...) and we agree to see each other 3 weeks after.

During this 3 weeks I made a book with a lot of pictures of us during this 4 years, she doesn't know that but I was keeping a lot of stuff of us and it was great. After this 3 weeks I was a little bit better, she calls me and I say that I was not sure to come anymore because it was maybe pointless, she tells me that she wanted to so I go.

This was the best day and night of my life, everything was perfect. It was raining, we was talking about us and our future, we eat at a restaurant and they were palying all our song (une maison bleue...). We was having a good time and we make love, i show her my book and it was beautiful, she says that she loves me, I say to stop saying that if it wasn't true, but she shays it again and we spend like 1 hours to look at each other.

The following days, I have to leave for a Damon albarn concert so I leave her, she texts me that she thanks me to come, it was perfect but she doesn't see her future right now and she doesn't want to. I answer that I have myself to build again my life with my friends and to be proud and what I am before do anything again. 4 days after she was putting a picture of me (nobody can know that it's me because it wys my back) at a place very important to me. I call her to understand, and she said that she doesn't understand why I and her friends say that it was weird, it was just a nice picture... (it's not!) anyway it was my last communication with her. (1 month ago now).

I have no idea what to do, I feel that it's over, but after 3 month of break up, I'm still sure she's the one, I don't feel to be with anyone, I can be by myself without a problem, I don't want to take a revenge or be with someone else, I just want to do the right things in order to not break our relationship. It's a nightmare to still think that there is a chance to go back with her, I can't get a closure and move on. But if I say that it's over, it's over and I don't want that. I'm lost and the pain doesn't decrease. What sould I do? Yesterday I send a mail to her bestfriend, she hates me but I feel like that it was my only choice and I tell her to call me and I wait for her call... What can i do?

114421,Relationships,1ivgow,"**tl;dr**: My girlfriend thinks that I'm wasting my potential by going to a university with a less-prestigious computer science program than the one offered at her school. Am I wrong to think that this is somewhat elitist, and that I can do just as well where I am?

I apologize for how wordy this ended up being, but I didn't want to leave out details or context, which I think is the best way to help anyone interested here to give useful advice. Thanks for your time.

My girlfriend and I both attend large, public universities in Washington state. More specifically, she's at University of Washington, while I'm at Washington State University. She's going for pre-med, and I'm working towards computer science. We met each other through crew; we row for our respective schools.

We were talking on the phone earlier tonight, as we do, well, every night, and she mentioned that I should transfer to UW. This comes up a lot; we both really like each other and wish that there wasn't a 5-hour drive between us during the academic year. This time, however, she framed the suggestion such that it would be ""beneath me"" to remain at WSU.

This bothered me a lot because I really like my school. She looks down upon it, and sees it as inferior to her school in just about every way. On past occasions, I've agreed that it might be beneficial for me to be in a higher-ranked program than the one I'm currently working for, but I'm comfortable with my current situation. UW's computer science program is extremely competitive though, and while I think it's more likely than not that I would make it, it's still a daunting proposition. As far as our sports go, UW mens crew is hands-down the best non-Olympic mens program in the world, and I would be extremely, wildly lucky to not be cut from the team right off the bat if I tried to transfer. Women's crew is not as competitive, but she's told me that she needs to improve because she couldn't handle the stress of being in a boat (""tier"" of the team, basically) that would make her vulnerable to being cut if she didn't continue to improve, which is the exact position that I would be in if I by some miracle could row there in the first place, and something that I don't want either.

Anyway, I explained to her that it seemed elitist and demeaning to me for her to tell me that my personal ""caliber"", so to speak, would be less if I chose to stay and get my degree at WSU than it would be if I transferred to UW and earned my degree there. I said, moreover, that I learn the same ""level"" of technical skills in my program compared to what I would at UW, with the only significant difference being the amount and availability of internships and off-the-bat career opportunities I would have access to. I'm not disputing that UW is a bigger and more powerful program, but I also realize that this is a field in which I can become skilled of my own volition and earn a great career at even the most ""high-end"" employers with an attractive github portfolio. I feel that my idea(s) for startups are worth whatever they are of their own accord, independent of the pedigree of my education, and I told her that she made me feel marginalized by claiming that I don't learn as much in my program, that I can do better, and that I'm somehow kicking myself by not doing so.

At this point, the discussion became emotional for us both. She explained her position that she needed to put herself in as competitive of a position to be successful as possible, and she couldn't settle for anything less than that, for the sake of her future and her future kids, etc. She said that she couldn't apologize for that, although I assured her that I expected no such apology. She was of the opinion that I should have the same perspective that, statistically speaking, UW is a better school for me to come out ""better set-up and established for myself"" than WSU, and I shouldn't let anything get in the way of me taking advantage of that.

I argued in response that I know friends and family who have been wildly ""successful"" but live in misery for various reasons, and that while I was accepted to both UW and WSU, I chose WSU because I liked the campus more, I knew that crime is FAR less of a threat there (I've been a victim of a serious crime that I'm still involved in litigation over and I'm really leery of the possibility of anything happening again), the cost of living is cheaper, and I just felt like it was the right fit for me. I explained to her that there have been many extraordinarily successful people who have gone through both of our schools, and I think that I can be successful of my own accord, without having to play what-if games of whether or not I could be as statistically destined for success as a different version of me that went to MIT.

She was hung up on the point that ""the numbers don't lie, and you can do better by being here instead.""

From here, we talked about general life satisfaction, judging and marginalizing people, working towards a person's potential, and always comparing ourselves to other people. Our views were irreconcilable, and I was consequently disturbed by the discord that erupted. We've both jived perfectly prior to this, and it hurt both of us to feel a complete lack of understanding and agreement about something as important as this, given that we effectively become a long-distance relationship at our respective schools for 10 months out of the year. It makes me feel slightly indignant to think that my girlfriend thinks that I'm not making the best decisions for myself.

She's hurt and she thinks that I think less of her because of this. I frankly had hoped for less, well, to use her own words, ""stone-cold bitch"" in her opinion, and the rationale with which she justified this seemed narrow-minded and judgmental to me. I still love her just as much as before, and she's really the most wonderful person I've had the fortune of getting to know (and I told her all of this), but I just don't know how to handle this to a mutually satisfactory resolution for the both of us.

My girlfriend was raised by very strict and traditional Chinese parents, and I've been brought up in a archetypal American style.

I'm putting this here because I need someone (preferably several someone-s) to tell me which side of this argument has the most merit. I want to empathize with my girlfriend, and I've done my best to objectively explain her side of things here, but I still find myself in agreement with my thoughts.

90844,Infidelity,2kacu1,"Hello all,

I am a 31 year old male and my wife is 25. We have been married for a year and a half. Recently my wife has gone back to school. 

She met Joe, a 39 year old single divorced guy at her community college. She claims he has two bachelors degrees. Claims he was a dual service branch guy. Army ranger and then Navy. He has a house boat at a yacht club.

Wife meets and talks to him at school every monday and wednesday.

Joe invited my wife on an overnight trip to Catalina island with friends on his boat. I didn't like the idea and told my wife I was not comfortable in her going overnight by herself with a guy she hardly knew. She decided not too but then the same day complained that she wishes she could have gone. I communicated with her that It would be cool if we both could go on a trip with Joe and his friends. My wife said that Joe told her he would invite us both if an opportunity presented itself. That invitation has not been made yet.....what a surprise. 

In mid September she went with him on an early morning hike and came home around noon.

After an argument with me in late September my wife left our house and drove to his house at 11:30 pm and stayed there until 230am. After she came home I asked her what they did together she said they went swimming with clothes on and watched the show ""Archer"" with him. She said that she needed to be around someone who did not want to cause conflict with her. Our argument was nothing major that I could remember.

The next day we had a fight about it. I was pissed that she left in the middle of the night to go visit this guy. I told her it made me nervous and unsafe that she did that. I also told her I was worried about her. She said she would not hang out with guys in 
the middle of the night from then on.

October 18th she went to his house at 8am to ""carpool"" to the zoo for a class project. Our home is closer to the zoo than his house. So she went out of her way to ""carpool"" with him. We have limited income at the moment with not alot of extra gas money. So going further makes no sense. My wife left our house in clothes she claimed where pajamas the previous night and said she changed to normal clothes at his house before the zoo. She claims to have stayed at the zoo for hours observing animals. She told me she needed to film some of the animals so she took our camcorder. She never filmed anything.

After the zoo she went back to his house to hang out and talk. He also bought her lunch. She has told me multiple times in the past that other guys buying her food makes it feel too much like a date and she would not be comfortable about it. She said that he just offered to buy her lunch and she went with it. She got home at 530pm. She claimed they just hung out at his house after the zoo. My warning bells went off like crazy.

Later that day I took a peak at my wife's phone and her text history with Joe. One line caught my eye. My wife texted him that she was watching a show about ""Horny badgers"". He responded with ""Lol you horny girl"". I confronted my wife about this and she claims that it was just an auto correct error. She ment to write she was watching a show about ""Honey badgers""on netflix. This is a legit show which I watched with her. She said that she was surprised when Joe called her a horny girl since It was not like him. 

The next day she told me that she asked Joe about it and that Joe was just messing around with her.

Today (October 24th) she went to his house at 8am and got home at 7pm. They went paddle boarding and ""hung out"" all day at the beach. When she got home and I asked her about details about what they did she got very defensive and said I just wanted to start a fight. She told me that she even told Joe before she left his house that she didn't want to come home because I would ""start a fight"".

My warming radar has been going off about this guy since I heard my wife talking about him. At first she would constantly talk about him and tell me about things he said and things she learned from him. This got very old after awhile and didn't seem right to me. She seems to have him on her mind constantly. I 
asked her to stop talking about Joe to me so much. My wife agreed that she was overdoing it and would work on talking about him so much. 

They text back and forth until late at night every day and they are friends on facebook.

My wife claims that he is a very busy guy with alot of friends, two jobs and a busy school schedule....yet he seems to constantly have the time to meet with my wife and ""hang out"" with her the entire day. It seems very suspicious to me. She will not let me meet him or invite me to hang out with the both of them. She claims that I am too jealous and would cause a problem. She said that she will let me meet him when she feels I'm ready. She keeps on telling me that its ok for her to have ""her friends"" that she keeps to herself.

She does not have many friends in general. She has two girlfriends she has known for about a year and one other guy friend she talks to at school. I have no problem with my wife having friends. I'm also ok with her having guy friends....but her relationship with Joe is stressing me out and I have a bad feeling 
about it. She seems to be infatuated with this guy. 

My wife has never cheated on me in the past and she claims that she never will. When I expressed my concerns about Joe she says that she knows how to set boundaries with her guy friends and that she would make sure they where in check when around her. I asked her how she would like it if I was constantly talking with and spending time with a single woman. My wife says that I am just being insecure and controlling.

I know this guy wants to get with my wife. All the signs are there.

I have tried to express to my wife many times that I wish she would spent less time with this guy and talk to him less. This has always led to a fight and my wife being defensive. Its even gotten to the point that my wife has a bed in the basement that she sleeps in when she claims that I am being ""too heavy"" and that I ""weigh her down"" and that I am ""always mad"". This is not true and I am one of the most laid back and positive guys I know. I have my own issues I need to work through and I do have a habit of shutting down and not communicating as much as my wife would like. But tons of people around me like me and I am very easy to get along with. When we have fights and arguments my wife talks about separation and divorce very often. I don't say things like that or make threats toward her like she does toward me. I have suggested we go see a marriage councilor or have us talk with a 3rd party there to moderate. But my wife has refused. We both attended a program called Life Skills together earlier in the year and it helped us get along. But now she is in an advanced version of that and I don't have the time and money to attend it with her. So she uses it against me.

Or am I being paranoid here? Or are all of these signs pointing to my wife emotionally or physically cheating? Am I being controlling?

Please help.

The guy I was dating for 11 months wanted to take time apart. I think he is scared of commitment. And he is very scared of introducing anyone to his son, mostly because of hurting the mother's feelings. She still loves him but he broke up with her a couple years ago because he didn't love her (got her pregnant when they just started dating). 

Anyway, I said that I could not take him back if he wanted a break because we only see eachother every other weekend (the ones he doesn't have his son), and that is a lot of breaks. I said that because I'm usually too nice and passive and I wanted to stand up for myself a little bit. Truth is though, I would really love for him to come back. We live 2 hours apart also. I text him once since our final conversation, just something short about an inside joke and he hasn't responded. Been broken up for 2 weeks.

I just really don‚Äôt think she should have much say when it comes to the money I earn, but she thinks she does.

In the future, I already told my brother that when he has kids I want to help out so they can go to whatever private school, whatever sports/clubs they want.

But recently she broke up with me, with the reason being, 'I knew you were falling in love with me, I couldn't return those feelings so I decided to end it.' She still extremely likes me but she can't love me due to her past.

I know that I need to get over her but it's hard when we work at the same place and are always around each other because of it. We both however do want to stay friends but that probably won't work out.

Is there anything that I *can* do for her to help her through this process? I want to be the best friend that I absolutely can during this.

I walked in one work night on my boyfriend (call him Bob) and my cousin best friend (Jane) fucking on my couch. At this point I say what the fucking fuck and they both say that he raped her. He says sorry she was sleeping and I was touching her she says I guess I can't drink anymore because men touch me when I sleep, looks like it happened again.

While I'm mulling over that my boyfriend is a rapist and I can't sleep the rest of the night, the next day comes and I call my boyfriend at work and lie saying she said she's going to the police for rape
to which he replies she's not mad, ask her so then I fucking ask her she says I'm just disappointed. Well that's fishy so I continue to lie to them both saying he's getting phone records and she's going to the police.

Their tune changes and he said she's been sending nudes for months and she says he sent nudes and they've been sexting for months and neither can agree how many times they've had sex, many in my house.

We went on a vacation together with my son and had to stay in hotels to which when I went to sleep they fucked, once outside because my 7 yr old son wouldn't go to sleep.
We all 3 hung out nearly every weekend before this and some weekdays. Even when she brought her boyfriend, they fucked while we were both sleeping I'd found out.

After knowing all this shit storm, 3 days after I walked in, Jane messages me a screen shot that he is still calling her and texting her call me, hope to see you soon thanks nice to hear your voice, thank u take it easy
Bob denied this conversation and then I showed him the screen shot and he never still gave me any answer for it. I'm never talking to Jane again.

I am intertwined in my job, financially and basically in every way besides being officially married and so I packed all my shit and backed out of leaving at the last minute.

I have come to consider reconciliation after he promises to be transparent with his phone and all accounts and we are only hanging out with concrete couples and not excessively drinking (even though so much had happened sober between them). 

I am thinking that this transparency thing really isn't helpful. From having it, I will dig until I find something I don't like but being in the dark with a hurtful person is scary. I think I might have the ability to forgive him but not forget.

I am really considering giving this another shot even though my odds are worse than spending my last dollar on a lotto ticket.

**tl;dr**: While I have described my personal tragedy where I walked in on my bf's and cousins affair, I'm seeking answers to what forgiveness mean to you and what sort of actions does it entail?

116015,Relationships,1hoc4r,"Yesterday, my brother [28] married a very na√Øve girl [24] after dating her for 17 months. Unfortunately, he is someone who lies as quickly as tell the truth. Sometimes the lies are tiny (what he spent money on or how much something cost) but other times the lies are huge (unemployment or cheating). He lies to preserve his pride and ego. He is younger than me [32/f] and has done this all of his life. 

My brother and his new bride got married yesterday at a restaurant and I was seated beside the bride's mother. I was quickly put on the spot: When did [brother] attend university? When did he go backpacking through Asia? How much money do your parents give him each month? Where are [bride and groom] getting their money? Why did my other brother leave his last job? And so on and so forth. Because we had assigned seating in the middle of a crowded restaurant, I really couldn‚Äôt stop these questions or get away from her. She was skilled at keeping me off balance and at keeping the questions coming fast and furious.

I answered all of the staccato-style questions truthfully but quickly found out that she had an agenda. She obviously wanted to protect her (recently married) daughter and I completely understand. When I told her that my brother didn‚Äôt go to university, she replied, ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt he take cultural studies?‚Äù Apparently, he told his bride and her family that he had studied at university and taken cultural studies. I had to reiterate to the mother of the bride, that no, he did not do that. My brother also has never gone backpacking through Asia, my parents don‚Äôt give him money, I have no idea who is giving the newlyweds money, and my other brother left his job to go back to school. 

What a mess! Now my brother‚Äôs new mother-in-law knows that he is a liar (which I suspect she already may have been aware of based on her questions, but didn‚Äôt have proof/confirmation). I don‚Äôt know what to do.

My brother doesn‚Äôt have a job and has limited prospects without education. His new bride is going back to school this fall. I believe that this marriage will not last and I believe the mother of the bride will use this juicy information against my brother ‚Äì maybe soon... maybe after their honeymoon‚Ä¶ maybe later this fall. I think I need to tell my brother what happened, but he and I are not close and have a very rocky relationship. I believe he is going to get really upset with me but I didn‚Äôt know that he had been telling these huge lies and so when asked, I didn‚Äôt have a cover-up story ready.

Reddit, what should I do? The reception with nearly 100 guests is Saturday evening. Should I send an email to my brother giving him the heads up about my conversation before the reception (he won‚Äôt pick up my calls)? Should I leave things alone and let the chips fall where they may? Should I wait until next week to tell him? I am stuck. I don‚Äôt know what to do.

22269,Relationships,1koaq1,"My girlfriend and I have been living together for close to a year now.  We had a very short time together before deciding to move in.  (Stupid we know, but we are where we are). 

The main issue I feel is that she is an introvert, and I am an extravert.  I desire spending time with her, and doing so brings me a lot of joy.  However, she likes to  have time alone.  I have a hard time doing this because her needed alone time seems to take way to long.  If given her way she would  be alone for a week without me.  This is hard because I need the time with her, just like she needs the alone time.   She does like time together, but when she reaches a certain point, she needs to enter this alone time.  This is hard to do since we live together.

She is an amazing woman, and I really do love  her.  The problem is that  our  relationship just never  seems to stay on because she wants to be alone often, and I want to be with her.  When we both want to be together, things are great.  It just seems those on times are becoming fewer and fewer.  

Since she  is an introvert (she is an extreme one) she wont even discuss our relationship problems with me.  Bringing them up only makes things worse.  However, if I dont bring them up, our relationship just stays in this limbo state.  

This constant struggle for time together/ alone time is wrecking havok on the relationship.  Has anyone out there  had success with this type of  relationship?

To make things worse she is basically dependent on me.  She dosent have  any close family or friends to go to if we break up.  I often feel that  is the  glue  holding us together, and  I would  like us to transform to a  relationship where  we are staying together soley because we want to out  of  passion.

We are seeing a counselor, but it dosent seem to be helping.  She  won't even go over the homework with me.  

I'm torn.  I love her very much, but lately I  dont  even feel the return of love.  I want to work on things, but it seems like she does not.  She still says she loves me and cares about  me, is still going to counseling with me, and has not made a decision to leave.  However, like I said, she rarely engages  in conversation about our relationship.

However, I feel almost used since I am taking care of her financially, and our relationship is not nearly what it needs to be.  This also makes it hard, because if we break up, I feel like I would be kicking her to the street to be homeless.  I would never want to see her like that, even if we had a bad breakup.

I feel we are both at fault for where we are.  I have a hard time just leaving her alone, and giving her space for unspecified ammounts of time, especially since we live  together.  She  has a hard time giving me the time and attention I need.  I dont want to break it off, because when we click, things are amazing.

This is not the  relationship either of us wanted, but I feel like we can get it back on track, we just can't seem to be able to do so.  I understand breaking up is the path we are on, but I want to avoid that.


I guess what I am looking for is some input from someone else on the  outside, who is impartial.  Does anyone have any luck with this type of relationship?

EDIT:  She feels that we may be incompatable.  I feel we are, and if we put forth the  effort we easily can be.  

She informed me yesterday that she does not know if she even wants to try and  fix it.  That she may want to leave.  Heartbreaking, but  her  choice.  She has one option to leave, and that is to go overseas.  

However right now, we are still living together, and I dont even know if her heart is into fixing this.  So we are in relationship limbo, and that is driving me nuts.  In the meantime we have the  on paper relationship, but lack it emotionally.

EDIT 2: There is an excellent response from her on here.  Please read my post, and hers!

He is like a little brother to me, I love him to death, but he recently said some sexist/misogynistic things which made me feel uncomfortable, and if it's really how he feels about women, i'm not shocked that his gf recently just broke up with him.

We were hanging out and i mentioned how a female friend asked for my advice about something, which she normally does, but never really takes my advice to heart and then complains when she should have. His response to this was, ""well, that's because women don't listen."" I responded by explaining how sex does't matter, he was still maintaining that since women don't listen to men, they usually fail at whatever they're trying to do. After attempting to explain it to him a few times, we just sat in silence, then it got dropped.

This was 4 days ago, it's still bugging me and I'm going to talk to him about it tonight. What I'd like is maybe some opinions on how to really open the conversation.

29762,Dating,1hem2o,"I know we're young, but love is still a strong emotion at this age, right? 

So some background: I started out talking to this girl because she had recently broken up with her boyfriend and I thought she was pretty cute. I didn't intend to date her at first but flirting is always fun. Well, we got closer and closer and eventually decided to date. 

I only had one other girlfriend before her but we weren't together for long because I ended up moving a thousand miles away (military). So I wasn't very experienced in the dating world but I definitely tried my best. In my opinion, I was the best boyfriend I could possibly be.

So the first two weeks were amazing, you know, the honeymoon phase as some call it. I spent every single day of spring break with her and she was definitely VERY into me. 

However, no relationship is perfect. After awhile we started having some minor problems, nothing big at all, just silly arguments. The main reason was because we were very very different. She came from a Jewish background and I was raised Christian, her family was pretty liberal while mine was more conservative. I really had no problems being different because I'm open minded and willing to accept/respect any and all of her beliefs. But for some reason being different always worried her and I think this caused her to lose some feelings for me.

Anyways, sometime during the next few weeks we took a break and then eventually she ended up breaking up with me because of her indecisiveness on whether we should date or not. Again, mostly because of our differences. 

The thing is, two months later and we're still very close friends. She knows that I have very strong feelings for her but she just wants to be close friends. Which I'm more than happy to be because she's still an important part of my life. I still tell her I love her in goodnight texts and sometimes she even says the same to me. But she doesn't want to date :/

I'm not sure what to do, I get mixed signals. Sometimes she seems really into me still while other times she just seems interested in being close friends. Whenever I ask she says she misses me and still loves me but she doesn't want a relationship right now.

The breakup doesn't hurt as bad anymore so it's not like this is affecting my life in a negative way, but I sometimes I feel like I love her even more now that we are no longer together. I'm still very sweet to her and text her almost every day. I'm even going to see a movie with her next weekend! 

I really don't want to get over her. I've already tried many times and I've decided I don't want to, I like her. I'm not even attracted to other girls. 

I know this may sound like silly teenage drama to some and there are more fish in the sea, but this is big part of my life. I spend a lot of time thinking about her and in the 2 to 3 months that we talked and then dated, I've never been more happy or enjoyed life so much.

So my question is, what should I do? I'd just like some opinions from unbiased strangers on the internet :P

107950,Non-Romantic,1nl46a,"I'm a college student without a job, and to be honest, If I'm offered something that seems to have no strings attached, I'm going to accept it. Most of my time is consumed by my major and I rarely ever get to see my family. So when my grandma offered to use her mileage to cover my plane tickets for free for a family reunion, I obliged. She assured me it would cost her nothing and really wanted all of us to be together. I saw no problem. I saw no reason why I would need to ask for permission to go there seeing as I am an adult. I was constantly thanking her and I want to take advantage of any chance I have to see her since she's getting older. My grandma and I are very close; she practically raised me when I was little and has always been a sort of mother figure to me. If seeing her and the rest of my family is what she wants and she found a free way to make it happen, I don't see why I can't accept and make her happy that her family can finally have time together after long gaps of time. [The family has gone as long as 5 years without seeing each other, which kills her]



So yesterday, I told my father we made plans for me to go out and see everyone. He was concerned with where I got the money for plane tickets and was a little upset I wasn't going to spend that break entirely at home instead. Some background information: when I'm not visiting his home, my dad complains constantly that I don't make enough time for him; when I am visiting home, he doesn't make any time for me, curses at me for bothering him, and barely speaks to me. That paired with the fact that I don't find it necessary to ask him for permission to travel since I'm an adult made me overlook the possibility he might have a problem with me going. Still, he seemed like he was okay with it once I explained the mileage situation.



Today, I spoke to my father and it turns out that when my family found out I was coming, they eagerly called him to see if he would come as well [he used up all his vacation days which I've already explained to them countless times.] In that conversation, they realized he wasn't paying for my flight and assumed my grandma was. He told them about the mileage and they start freaking out saying she has no mileage and someone must be lying and that she must be paying a fortune for my tickets. 



When my grandma was booking my tickets, she was back and forth on the phone with me and the airlines to ensure her mileage was covering it. I have proof from my e ticket that she didn't spend a dime. Somehow, her sons [my uncles] are convinced she or I are lying and that my dad better pay her back for my tickets or they'll continue fighting him on it. Now, my dad is mad at me for not only ""going behind his back"" getting the tickets without his permission but for believing my grandma got them for free when ""clearly"" she didn't. 



First, I think this is ridiculous that I have to continuously remind everyone I am an adult so I should not have to go through my parents to figure out my plans on my breaks. Second, I think it's inappropriate for my uncles to ask my father whose paying for this when finances aren't their business. Third, I think they should have come to my directly instead of through my father who isn't even involved. And last, I have proof this is free but at the courtesy of my grandmother, I don't see why I would have to send everyone a copy of my e ticket to prove something that isn't their concern in the first place.



So what step do I take from here? Everyone is hot headed over something stupid and overly involved. How do I remind everyone it's not a big deal and tell them to please back off? Should I just not do anything at let it resolve itself?

I have blocked his calls and text messages. He sent me letters in the mail.

Good afternoon Redditors, I'm not sure what I'm looking for exactly, but anything you feel is a direct response to what I have posted is acceptable.

So I guess a bit of background info is necessary to some extent.  I am 28 and still live at home, not ashamed of it, just spent my money in all the wrong places as the years went by, slowly working towards changing this situation. I currently work full time however the salary is terrible for a person my age with a bachelors degree.  I have a loving family who helps me through my troubles, a terrible extended family whom I've gone no contact with and a very loving girlfriend.  I have a lot of personal issues and have recently been attempting to change things for the better.

My girlfriend is very loving and supportive of me (even though she makes much more money than I do) and always tries to help me in any way she can.  She's always had a hard time communicating with me regarding anything personal, and this has affected us in the past.

I'm not going to sit here and lie to you guys, in the past I had done some shitty things during the early stages of our relationship and she did as well, we're not the perfect couple on paper but we get through our issues and make it work anyway because we know deep down we love each other very much.

She recently started confiding in me more and more with personal issues of her own and things she still feel she needs to change so our relationship can last the test of time.  It took more than 3 years for her to get there but I'm glad she finally did.  I was never giving up hope that she would, she's just had a lot on her plate for a while and wanted to wait until she was comfortable enough to realize it was okay to confide in me.

Her past includes a cocktail of drug and alcohol usage along with a dysfunctional family, however she straightened her act up before we met and has been clean and sober for 7 years! I'm so very proud of her for that accomplishment.  

We met online as a casual encounter but from the day we met we knew we were each others ""the one"" (or should it be plural, lol) anyway to this day she can't get over the fact that I wore camouflage cargo shorts a tee-shirt and a fitted hat to a dinner date even though it was over 90 degrees and our plan was literally to have dinner and then go back to her place and have sex (she wore a beautiful yellow sundress).

As I'm typing this I'm realizing we've had a lot of great memories in our relationship and I cannot believe I was such a shitty person, regardless she loved me and was not innocent all the time.  We had an issue for a while where we would use a double standard on each other and it really created a lot of doubt and mistrust among us.

So lately, her communication is getting better but since it's still not so great I've decided in my twisted mind that I could blame her for all my insecurities and troubles.  My shitty job, lack of financials, terrible relationship with extended family and whatever else I could find negative in my life.

So yeah, recently I've realized I'm not a happy person, my demeanor is killing me and so is my status.

I've started re-tweaking my resume and actively searching for a new gym to join, I'm lucky to have my girlfriend in my life, and my parents have been helping me try to save better for my/our future.

I used to be a fun loving person who was care free and never let my troubles show but recently I've had to mask all that with falsities. A couple of weeks ago I noticed that I just wasn't the same fun loving person and was literally just using alcohol to feel that way again, I'm not saying I was an alcoholic but I had similar tendencies. I never told her about this because her being sober, I felt like I would be a burden to her well-being, so I played it off as I just enjoyed having a couple nights of drinking to break up the stress of working and commuting long hours.

I was essentially using alcohol to be my old self again, and as soon as I wasn't drinking I was back to being dare I say ""depressed"", I've been diagnosed with depression in the past, but again now i just have similar tendencies.

I'm trying really hard to become a different, more fun loving, and caring person , but it's proving to be a bit more than I can chew at the moment.

As of late I am constantly using my girlfriend's inability to communicate with the problems I am having so she doesn't see the real issue(s).

I made an appointment with a psychologist which is coming up this Saturday and am hopeful something can be done to stop myself from doing what I'm doing.

I've tried to cut alcohol out of my life but still find it as a social occurrence, which is fine, because I can handle that, and I quit smoking cigarettes going on almost 3 months now.

Anyway I thank you all in advance for anything you have to say to me, I have a thick skin so don't be afraid to be brutally honest with me.

165936,Breakups,1ymgw8,"Hi all, I've never posted a question to any online forum before but I am seriously bewildered and heart broken by this guy.

Basically the story is this: we met online, both just out of long term relationships (about two months out for both of us). Neither was looking for more than a casual hook up but the chemistry was off the charts - we just got on SO WELL. We had so much fun and great conversation and I just felt comfortable.

We started seeing each other exclusively almost immediately. We both expressed fear that things were moving fast, but we talked it out and were both really honest (I thought). After like a month and a half, he tells me he loves me, which I took with a pinch of salt owing to the intensity of the situation. But I also felt like it could grow into something real, and trusted that it was the same for him. 

I worried occasionally that he would hurt me - he has a self admitted history of dating girls for a few months and then dumping them. But that was before his last girlfriend and I chalked it up to him being young. I thought he had grown up a bit from the things he said to me, his introducing me to his family over christmas, and wanting to spend ALL his time with me... HAHA red flags amirite?

I'm a pretty steady person and I began to fall in love with this guy. Baby love, but with the prospect of something real. Then one day, a week into the new year, he starts acting weird and withdrawing from me. Eventually after some back and forth about 'taking breaks' and 'not seeing each other so much' he dumps me. Says, matter of factly, that he doesnt see himself ever falling in love with me and doesnt 'get' me. Just like that.

You guys, I am crushed. I just don't understand. It's so high school. Why would someone do that? I just want to understand. Was he lying the entire time we were together? Why would someone do that? Why did he tell me he loved me, that i was wonderful, that i made him feel free, that i was beautiful (for the record, i am no-ones idea of hot, just average) etc etc? I'm a normal girl who doesn't usually attract shallow douchecanoes.

80867,Dating,2ctzrz,"So I just found out today that I tested positive for the herpes 2 virus. I was tested last September but was not informed until a visit with my gynecologist today. It came as a bit of a shock. I'm not sure exactly when I contracted it. 

A few years ago I went through a generally promiscuous and unsafe phase, but I eventually wised up and started to be safer. I had gotten tested several times over the past couple years and was told I was fine. I made a decision that moving forward, I would be as safe as possible and not act foolishly like I did in my younger years. 

For some reason, the full results of the most recent test (September) didn't get back to me until today. So there it is. BAM. Herpes. I was floored. Cried a bit in the doctor's office. A nurse brought me cookies.

I ended a long-term relationship several weeks ago and have since been seeing a guy I have known for a few years. I REALLY REALLY like him. I have had feelings for him since I met him, we had a brief stint of something about a year ago before I entered a relationship with my last boyfriend, and now finally having the opportunity to date him is amazing. He recently asked me if I wanted to be in a relationship with him. It was difficult to do, but I had to decline. I am still healing from my last relationship and part of the reason I broke up that person was because I wanted time to be single to figure out what the hell I want to with my life so I'm not miserable all the time (I have BPD and this is a struggle for me).

Anyway, I told the dude I'm seeing that I really like him and would love to continue seeing him casually and just see where it goes. This is someone I can envision spending the rest of my life with. We have both casually entertained the idea of someday being married. We have very strong feelings for each other, but I am in such a confusing and fucked-up headspace at this point in my life and I don't feel like I'm ready for commitment of any kind. I am the kind of person who is liable to make a random decision to up-and-move to another country one day. (Just to clarify, he is not pushing marriage ideas or any kind of long term commitment on me - he has just asked if I would like to be his girlfriend.)

Anyway, as it seems we are continuing to see each other casually for now, I obviously owe him information about my herpes. Unfortunately, he lives a few hours away from me and I probably won't be seeing him for another couple weeks. This is really weighing on my mind and I am terrified of scaring him away with this news. I don't know if I should call him up today and tell him, or if I should wait until I see him in person. How should I bring it up? What do I say? If anyone's had any personal experiences with this sort of thing, I'd love to hear them. I'm just so shocked right now and at a complete loss. I'm thinking of spending my evening rewatching Game of Thrones and crying over a pint of ice cream.

EDIT: I forgot to add that while I have apparently had herpes for at least a year, I have never had an outbreak. This is part of the reason the news came as such a shock to me. Also, I have already contacted my ex-boyfriend and shared the news with him.

This past 2 months, he's been more stressed than usual.  But he's obviously not good with stress, and he has been impatient etc with me at times.  But the biggest problem is we've had several arguments during this time.




--------------------------------------------------------------



I can handle arguments.  Everyone argues.  But it is more what he says during these arguments that makes me fear we will never go back to how we were.  He has been very rude at times.  He has also blamed me for things that are not my fault, been very short with me, and said things to suggest I'm not successful in my career because I'm lazy (completely unfair and untrue, and he said this because he thought I wasn't helping him enough while he was stressed out at work).

I know chances are good he didn't mean any of these things, but he also never apologized.  He just told me he doesn't want to fight with me and he loves me.  But the things he has said to me lurk in the back of my head now.  Even though we've ""moved on"" from the arguments, I find I don't have that fuzzy warm lovey feeling towards him now.  Instead, I feel a bit of resentment or something.  Annoyance.  Maybe some contempt or something....I can't pinpoint it, but it is a negative emotion and in stark contrast to how I used to feel about him.

I don't watch hardly any television, but my roommates watch shows like Desperate Housewives and RuPaul quite religiously. When we were still close friends, I was usually out of the loop with all pop-culture references they made.

The way I process conflict is with a very even steady tone, and I don't try to say hurtful things that wouldn't solve the problem. I also don't talk about the people who cause problems in my life as a source of entertainment, also known as ""shit-talking."" My roommates are the very opposite.

It's very hard to hear people talk about how weird you are behind your back, and I have been very sad lately because of it. However, I don't confront them on this, because I know that them thinking that I am weird and aloof is a non-negotiable subject. 

Alas, I can't help being and acting sad because these people were once very close to me and it's hard to overhear them voice what they have been thinking of me all along is very difficult. Not to mention that I have no friends anymore.

My problem is that roommates will pretend to be overly-fake-nice with high-pitched voices one minute, and then the next will give me eye-rolls and one liners that are simply unheard of to me outside of reality television, that is hard for me to convey with just text. I consider myself a pretty direct person, but hearing someone say ""I'm sorry?????"" and interrupt me while I'm talking to say ""I'm sorry but these last few day's you've been in some kind of MOOD or something, and it's HONESTLY making me really uncomfortable. Sorrieee."" is something that I just don't know how to react to because it feels so surreal to me. My throat just closes up and it makes me want to hide or slam my head into a wall until I wake up from this nightmare.

If I say that I am off on tuesday, wednesday, and thursday...then we assume that we are hanging out on tuesday, wednesday, and thursday.

One thing that get's me is that I feel like I need a little more time to myself.  I'm somewhat fine with my days off being on lockdown...but it's the days where I work earlier that I just want to go home and read and relax.

Or if not hurt her feelings, I am afraid she will mistake it as a red flag to our relationship.

(Relevant)My and my GF are from India. Culturally when it comes to dating, it's very different from the culture in West. The culture of Arranged marriage is still prevalent , although it's slowly fading away.

My GF's family is very orthodox and we knew from beginning that when she will be around 26 , her parents would force her to get married.
It's a retarded cultural thing, IMO ,but she was never strong enough to go against her family.

Since we are from different caste, state , she is a vegetarian and I am a non vegetarian and the fact that I am 10 months younger to her would all be an issue for her family .

It would be extremely hard for her family to accept me, is what she had maintained throughout the relationship. 
That's what I believed throughout .


**Us:**

Me and my girlfriend used to work in same company. We met in office, went out a few time and then officially became a couple around 3 years back. From then we had some amazing times together . We used to meet almost every single day and used to go out for most of the days.

We were each other's best friend. We've done a lot of 'first's together, we explored a lot of places together and we hung out as much as we could.

Within a few months, I was addicted to her (and I always thought she was too to me). If we couldn't meet for few weeks, it would be extremely hard for each of us.

I always felt there was a huge bond between us. And it's not because of her looks. 
I dated a 8/10 previously and she was 5/10 at best. 
My friends and to some extent my family were not very happy with the way she used to dress and look.
But to me, I looked passed all that and it was her personality that I loved so much.

I felt like I could trust her more than I trusted myself. Be it money, some secret or even our past. 

Every moment without each other was hard and within few months we both agreed to marry.

**Issues:**

There were two major issues that were always a part of our relationships:

*1) She refused to have sex before marriage (again, a cultural thing).*

This was extremely hard for me, as I've had plenty of sex in my previous relationship. I was sexually overwhelmed in my previous relationship and all of a sudden coming to full stop was not easy for me. This had caused me a lot of frustration and resulted in a few fights , but at the end I agreed with her . 
Her virginity was a big deal to her and she really wanted to give it to 'someone special'.

To me since I've loved her even without having sex with her for 3 years, I think no one else deserved to be that special person but me.


*2) I was apprehensive about getting married early (when I was 25).*

I was never mentally prepared to get married when I was 25-26. 
While it would be hard for her to postpon her marriage beyond that, due to her emotionally manipulative parents . 

Although I always maintained that I will surely marry her I never gave her a date. 
And only because I didn't know when can we get married .

However, despite having no sex and agreeing to marry early against my will I loved her with all my heart.
I sacrificed a much better , much higher paying job(5x pay) in Singapore , simply because I didn't want to move away from her.

I left my plans for Higher study in US so that I don't have to move away from her.

In her defence, she never told me not to. But I knew that if I do move away, her parents would surely get the best of her and she would be forced to get married to someone else.

***The final months***

As is the custom here, girls and boys have to see other other (before arranged marriage) . Her parents (unaware of me)had found a guy who is settled in US and she was to see her.

I was not scared or even feeling jealous for most of the time, simply because I trusted her to say NO to a random dude she's meeting formally.

But the pressure from her family to get married to a guy was mounting and it was high time that she tell her parents about me.
We decided on a date to tell her parents. 

**The betrayal** 

And then out of blue I got a call from her saying that her engagement is decided and it's too late to tell her parents.
This was 2 weeks before the decided date.

I was shocked and in dismay. So I told her to tell her parents the same day, if that's the reason she is getting engaged. 
However she was apprehensiveness . But I forced her anyway, and she told her dad.

And to both of my surprise, her dad had no issue with me. 
So now it was in her hands . The path was almost clear. The only minor hurdle was that few or her relatives knew that her engagement was fixed and it would be embarrassing to tell them again that it's not the same guy now,

But the next day she called me and said she does not want to marry me.
WHAT?

This was a huge huge shock to me. Throughout our relationship she has maintained that she can't wait to get marry me.

But the day the ball was in her court, she flat out said NO.
Instead she wants to get marry the guy her parents has chosen for her. Whom she only met two times.Only formally.

Her reasons for dumping me when she could've easily married me:
-&gt; Because we used to have some fights in the past, she thinks if we get married we would have fights in future too.
That's it!!!


It was only later I realised that, by marrying the guy she met twice:

-&gt; She's getting a US stay

-&gt; Since he's a richer guy than me, he'll sponsor her higher study.

This was a girl I've scarified everything for. This was the girl I left a job and ditched my study plans to be together with.
This was the girl for whom I agreed to marry early against my will.

And when it came to actually make the call, she instantly chose an easy life in US and free higher education over me.

She does not even acknowledge the fact the I've given up everything for her. 
The only thing that now matters to her is an easy life ahead.

It's very easy for her to dump me.
In a few week she'll be busy with her new life and I'll be here broken alone and with a confused career path (Which I chose to be in to stay with her).

She is willing to marry a guy she barely knows and willing to give up her virginity to him(which I deserve), simply because he's richer and in a better position that me.

Or in other words, that guy is getting her and her virginity and will be having staying with her throughout his life just because he's richer than me and is in US. He didn't make any effort to sway her. 
Where as I had struggled for months initially for her to like me and say YES to my proposal, I've struggled to make this relationship work despite every issue we had but here I am.. ending up losing everything.

I'll start by saying that I have really cared about my relationship and about my SO very much. I am just tired and feel like I need something different. Any comments/suggestions are welcome and will be greatly appreciated.

There is a main reason why I wrote this and a TL:DR at the end.

Background:

We were introduced to each other by one of my friends. I was 16 and she was 15. We did our little dating thing for a couple months and then broke up. Months later i ended up getting a job and eventually my own car. This allowed us to become best friends. During this friendship I fell in love with her. I was her prom date and that is were I first told her I loved her. She did not love me back at that time though.

We still remained best friends after that night. Within months, she eventually decided that she loved me. Her decision was based on how much I cared for her, how much time we spend together and that I really was the right person for her. This was in June, 2011. I was 17 and she was 16.

Our relationship was great and it felt exactly the same as before we got together, best friends. Months pass and I decide to join the Air Force Reserves. We both agreed that it would not be a problem. I left for basic training in February, 2012. It was hard leaving my best friend for any length of time at all; tears were shed. During graduation, my family brought my SO with them to Texas. It was great although the time together was very limited. They left and I was on to tech school.My tech school was a year long. I expected to be extremely close to home after the first three months, but It did not turn out that way.

The first three months of tech school involved me having limited freedoms. That made it so I could only communicate with my girlfriend at night. Just being able to look forward to talking to her was great. We would either talk on the phone or FaceTime most of the time. We would share how our days went and whatnot, then try to find other things to talk about. While she was a main priority, I was also meeting new people. I had friends that wanted me to go explore the town and do various activities with them. That's when things started going slightly downhill.

She would always expect me to come back from school and talk to her constantly. I was pretty sure she did not trust me for some reason. I know there is jealousy of other girls but I did not plan on being around any women. I had a lot of missed opportunities/fun because of her not wanting me to do things. I visited home and paid for her to come visit during those three months. That did not bother me one bit, but it did not allow me to save anything when I lived practically free. Then in August, 2012 I went to a different place for a separate phase of tech school. I was already disgruntled from my limited freedom, but I was in love with her and it was my fault I was gone; so I dealt with it.

After arriving to phase 2, I got settled in and continued talking to my SO like we always did. Because my group of friends had now become tighter, there was more times I wanted to do things with them, rather than waste my day just staring at my phone, not really talking. She did not like the fact that sometimes I would have rather hungout with people than talk to her. She would say things like ""I really hate you."" Stuff like that constantly happened and it gets tiring. She was the type to constantly break up with me for a day and I would feel like I did something wrong and just get back together. I never said anything mean to her. 

Around thanksgiving time, some of us classmates decided to go to florida because we got free tickets to Universal Studios. She did not want me to go, even though it was a once in a lifetime opportunity for me. I decided to go against her wishes and go anyway. Before we even left our station, she had already cussed me out. She said she hates me so much and that I should have never been born and that my parents shouldn't have had me if they couldn't really take care of me. There was a lot more said but I don't remember all of it. She ended up ""breaking up"" with me again. After what she had said, I was not sad one bit about it.

I go to florida thinking I will never get back with my SO again. I ended hooking up with someone. The whole weekend, my girlfriend kept trying to talk to me and I was stupid enough to talk back to her. On the way back to station, I told her what I had done, which did not go to well for either of us. We ended up getting past that and getting back together. Within a month later she was hanging out at a friends and she got really drunk slept with some guy. She stated that it was part intentional as an act of revenge. I looked past it because she had been holding what I had done against me as ""cheating"" although we were not in a relationship. To this day I do not bring up what she did although she brings up what I did white often.

Months pass with the constant I hate you's and not really being aloud to do anything because she no longer trusts me. I still let her hangout with whoever she wanted to because I have that trust.

In March, 2013 she came to stay with me for the last month of tech school. I had my own room on base but we stayed in a hotel with kitchen supplies and all that. During march I decided to propose to her because of my love I still had. She accepted. We were set to leave and go home in the middle of April. A week before that we got into a fight where she assaulted me, so I left to go stay somewhere else for the remainder of the time. I decided I was mostly done with her and revoked the ring. We drove back home together and stayed the night halfway back. To make it easier on her I promised her we would only be one a break for about a month after we got home. And that's exactly what we did. 

When we got back together it was a little better. I was living at a friends house (which is where I lived since I graduated high school). She would come stay with me and eventually practically lived with me again. This was in May, 2012. By August we decided to move in together. 

The main reason I write this:

Within a month of living together we got into a fight where she ended up hitting me, biting me, breaking my things, and kicking me as I did nothing back to her unless it really hurt. My retaliations were nothing more than a grapple to restrain her. This fight started because months prior I asked a friend if he wanted to go see some fireworks on a specific date. Well that day came and she did not want him to go. I tried saying that we can't just change plans like that. So she started getting mad and I just ignored my friend to go. I still feel like a bad friend for ignoring him and not going. 

Things were bad for a while the returned to normal. The fighting still in the back of my mind. That, combined with all the hateful things said from the past is still on my mind. 

On Veterans Day 2012, we had planned on going out to dinner. Before my SO and I even had plans, I asked some friends if they wanted to come too. When I get home from work, she decides that she does not want to go because of my friends going. I think that's alright and decide I will just go with them. When I tell her my intentions for the night, she forbids me from going. That stemmed to another fight where she assaulted me the same way as the fireworks event. I had a friend come over to help me be able to leave. She would not let me go. She threatened to take a lot of pills if I left (prescription from a surgery). I had to physically knock the pills out of her hand and destroy them. I came back that night and was distant for a few days then things returned to mostly normal.

The main reason I never just moved out was because I was the financial support. She would not move out when I wanted her to because legally she was just as entitled to the apartment as I was. I did not want to leave because I did not want to pay for somewhere I was not living. So things just worked back to normal. 

I'll skip forward to how I feel today. After everything we have been through, I just do not have the mental or sexual attraction to her. With two months left on our lease I decided to mention breaking up. I could have been harsh and held out til two weeks before. I don't find her interesting nor do I enjoy doing a lot with her anymore. I think I'm just tired of being in a relationship. I also want to experience different things. Even though she says I can do anything I want, I still feel trapped. 

These next two months are going to suck. She doesn't want me to leave nor will she leave. 

I would just like to know what you all think. 

TL:DR - mentioned breaking up with girlfriend and she doesn't agree. She has controlled me for most of the relationship  and physically abused me. Should I feel bad breaking up with her to experience different things?

83886,Relationships,1h8saz,"So basically I'm in a relationship with a girl from another town since about 4/5 months ago. She lives with her mom, and is a very lonely girl. This week her mom got the flu and she had to take care of her ( she is in a lot of stress ), casually this week my car broke so I couldn't visit her during the week ( but plan to do so today ).

On wednesday I had the birthday of my sister, for obvious reasons she couldn't go. Yesterday I went to my brother house for dinner and when I came to my house I got a text from her are you back? I called her ( I called her a lot during this week ) and she then went on a rant on how I was having fun and she was tired and caught the flu, I calmly explained that I couldn't go there because the car is on the shop (she already knew). Then she went on a rant on how my family ( specifically my sister-in-law) is rude because they don't think about her ( which is not true, she is always invited with me, and my family likes her), I calmly explained that it was not the case.

She also stated the following things:

- She distrust my sister-in-law despite she barely knows her and they had little interaction

- She feels that's unfair that I sometimes say that I'm not happy while I should be happy because I'm with my family or friends having fun meanwhile she has no one to visit.

- She wants to let her enter my world (know my family) despite she is unavailable most of the week and on the weekends she often doesn't want to see them (neither do I, I prefer to spend time with her).

I feel that's unfair because I'm the one who travels the most to see her even during the week and I call her everyday ( multiple times a day) and here I'm being scolded for going to dinner with my brother. 

She ended up saying that it was just a bad day for her and that I should ignore it, but made me feel like shit, and honestly I don't feel like being nice and visiting her today. Despite that I feel that there is something that makes her uncomfortable and I don't know what to do.

173496,Relationships,2xpm06,"My boyfriend and I just celebrated our first anniversary. The past year has been great, but in the last few months he's gotten really close with his female coworker. She likes a lot of the same stuff we like and I've begun to notice that lately every song he listens to, movie he watches, article he reads, etc is a suggestion from her.

Also, we go to a lot of concerts/shows in our area. Lately, she's been at every. single. one. Which is fine, except he seems to hang on every word she has to say and seems over eager to have conversations with her (and vice versa).

We went to a concert on the night of our anniversary and surprise, she's there. She texted him letting him know where she was. Looking at his phone screen, I realize they've been texting back and forth...a lot. We meet up with her and again, they're sitting next to each other talking and it's like I'm not even there.

I finally let him know how angry I was about the situation that night when we got home. He admitted that he does have a crush, but that's all it is. He says he'll stop texting her. We talk it out and everything seems fine.

A few days later, he left to go run an errand. I remembered that he phone also sends texts to his iPad. I got on his iPad (I know, I know) and read through their texts. Nothing too suspicious, but then I see that she's going to another show that he surprised me with tickets to *after* we had the conversation.

123532,Non-Romantic,30e1ls,"My rooommate recently said that she wants to adjust our rent split from 50/50 to 60/40, even though our rooms are the same size.

**EDIT 2:** I talked to my roommate and we both agreed that for this month, she notified me too late for it to be fair to do a 60/40 split, and if we maintained 50/50 it would make us even in terms of having guests live with us without a rent adjustment. From next month on, we'll be splitting everything 60/40. Solve it without any hiccups, we both think the resolution is fair, and our relationship as friends walks out undamaged. Success--thanks Reddit!

**EDIT:** Thanks for the responses, everyone! There are a lot of good points in here that I hadn't thought about before. I thought it was pretty clear cut to stay 50/50 at first, and as you can see from my perspective below, I was firm on it. However, since so many of you guys have brought up points that do make sense to me, I've decided that I'm going to negotiate with her to split it based on square footage. She has already agreed to pay me 50/50 this month since it's so late, but next month I think we will both pay equally for our own room and split the price 3 ways for the common area. Will give an update after I talk to her.

Background: We've been friends since college and have always gotten along. Not one of my closest friends, but we've always had a great and relaxed relationship. The type of friends that hang out to catch up or go out occassionally, but not the kind that you call to ask advice about every life event.

I was the one who did all the apartment hunting, maintains the relationship with our landlord, set up and takes care of all utilities, and cleans the apartment (she isn't dirty but also doesn't clean, and I've just resorted to doing it myself instead of trying to ask her for help since I care about cleanliness of the apartment more than she does). Originally we said we would split the rent 50/50 because both bedrooms are the same size. Since she is a student, I know rent is pretty expensive for her.

She asked me if her cousin could move in with us for a few months while she was looking for her own place, and I agreed. I still paid 50% of the rent, while her and her cousin both paid 25% each, and the three of us split utilities evenly. Eventually, my boyfriend had also decided to move up to SF, and I asked my roommate if he could live with us, and she said she didn't mind. My roommate and my boyfriend have never had any problems; not best friends, but they've always been on good terms. So now there were 4 of us in the apartment, splitting rent and utilities 4 ways.

**EDIT**Neither of them went through an official process to get approve by our landlord, but my landlord knows my boyfriend stays with us for extended periods of time and she is on great terms with him, so there wouldn't be issues from that end getting him approved.

Her cousin and I got along but eventually the relationship started to get worse. She wouldn't clean up after herself, constantly had guests over, and one night, she gave her friends the key to our place without coming back with them, and they ended up having sex on our couch. That was the last straw for both of us, and we agreed that she should move out. At this point, my boyfriend had actually gotten a sublet to try living on his own, but while he had his sublet, I was either at his place, or he was at my place. 90% of the time we would stay in either one of our places (mine almost all the time), so we agreed that it didn't really make sense for him to be paying so much for a room that he was rarely in.

He moved back in with us (this was after my roommate's cousin had moved out). I asked my roommate if it was okay and she said it was. At this time, it was supposed to be temporary; my boyfriend and I had been having some arguments and he was deciding if he wanted to stay in the city or go back to LA, so it also didn't make sense for him to lock down a place here if he was planning on returning to Socal.

My boyfriend has always been super respectful of my roommate and our apartment because he behaves like a guest. I've heard some horror stories about male roommates being dirty, not helping out with housework, etc. My SO does all the dishes right after he eats, and stays in my room because our TV/his computer are both in there. He's only in the common area to eat. He does the trash without asking and runs a bunch of errands for the house without asking to be paid back or anything.

Yesterday, I got a text from my roommate saying we should talk about rent before she puts in her half for the month, and that it was something we should talk about in person. I was at work and told her I'd like to get an idea so I'm not distracted figuring out what it is all day. She told me that my SO was having a bigger presence on the shared space than she had previously thought he would, and that she only said yes to him living with us because she was under the impression that he would eventually get his own place. She said that we should split rent 60/40 instead of 50/50 (we both pay $1500 now, so a 60/40 split would make her rent $1200 and mine $1800, for the same-sized rooms). I told her I didn't think it was fair because I put up with her cousin who used the common space every night, constantly had people over, and who defiled our couch so I ended up buying a new one for our apartment. She said the situation was now irrelevant and that it didn't have anything to do with what was happening now, and that I could have spoken up if I had wanted an adjustment back then. I told her I was trying to be considerate which is why I didn't try to nickel and dime her back then. She also said that it wasn't a money issue but that it was more of an issue with my boyfriend's presence. Since she's never brought this up until now, I just feel a little blindsighted. My boyfriend said he's okay with paying the incremental rent but I don't see it as fair since space-wise, we're equal and he doesn't even use the common area except to eat a meal every now and then (usually when my roommate isn't even home since she's at school).

104738,Dating,35rrc4,"I (m19) was involved in a confusing, semi-romantic relationship with a girl (f17) for about two months. During that time, she confided in me that she is addicted to sex. I ended the relationship two months ago when I realized she had been dishonest and manipulative with me, and that she had had sex with someone else about two weeks after we expressed interest in each other and started hanging out. I didn't tell her exactly what my reasons were because everytime I saw her discussing an interpersonal conflict with someone, she was screaming or crying. I didn't want to deal with that, and I knew she would just stand by the lies she had told me, and say I was naive to expect exclusivity with her, given that the relationship was undefined. There has been animosity and tension between us since then, mostly from my end.

I'm considering sending this text to her: Hey, I just wanted to tell you I don't bear any animosity toward you. We had not discussed exclusivity by the time of the Brooklyn Bridge project, so I have no reason to be angry about that, although it was irresponsible of you to not tell me, given how inexperienced and naive I clearly was about how relationships work. (I have not had anything close to a romantic relationship since middle school, and she knew that) I forgive you now for the elaborate lie you told me to explain the phone call you received in front of me. That kind of dishonesty is something that comes with any addiction, and I sympathize with you. There were a few other things that led to my ending the ambiguous relationship, but they're not significant enough to hold a grudge about -- if you want to change the pattern your relationships seem to follow, consider changing those ""habits (you've) created over time"" that can be ""confusing."" (The quote is from a previous email exchange) Assuming I know what you're talking about, they really suck, and I made the right decision when I decided I was done dealing with them. I think we both could have handled things better when we got back from the break, and I'm sorry for my part in that. Good luck with everything you're dealing with.

153596,Breakups,34eq58,"**tl;dr**: Skyped my ex-boyfriend after feeling 'mostly fine' about the breakup; now I'm crumbling again not only because I know I've lost and miss my boyfriend, but also my best friend. With lots of backstory and future circumstances making it so much more confusing for me.

**Some backstory:** I met my boyfriend in city C one and a half years ago. We only knew each other for several days before we got serious and our relationship was the ideal one. He was my first everything - kiss, foreplay, sex, kinks, the works. I couldn't have asked for a better boyfriend. We also did a lot together: we met each others' parents, went on holiday together, lived with each other for ~2 months. I even travelled to the city he grew up in to visit the city and meet his parents. 

We broke up because city C was never a home to either of us - I finished university and had to move back home to country A. He also needed to go back to country B to finish up his university course (he was taking a break and living in city C) and while I thought we could last because I was hopeful and idealistic, his first relationship was an LDR that hurt him badly so he couldn't and didn't want to commit to another one. 

I went back to country A in March; he went back to country C several weeks later. We broke up and while I wouldn't say it was bad, it wasn't good either. It wasn't bad because we both wanted to stay friends in the future but it wasn't good because I wanted so badly to try and he said he would try but we broke up for real one week into our LDR over Skype. It was hard on me because it was the end of my first relationship and the first time someone broke my heart but I started feeling normal again after 2 weeks so that was a relief. 

We maintained no contact until last week, when he messaged me on Facebook. We had a chat; just impersonal catching up. I was still guarded but I was happy that he was the first one to message me because in my mind, it showed that I was still on his mind, like how he was on mine and how much I had to fight talking to him.

**The current situation:** Our last conversation on Facebook last week was also the first one we had since the breakup in mid-March. Today, I messaged him because I wanted to talk to him. We skyped. I was healing and getting over him slowly but the first FB message he sent me was just the catalyst into triggering how much I missed him. It's one thing to lose out on the intimacy and the sex, which is what I miss a lot but it's a whole other thing to lose the person you send cat stuff you find on the internet to because you know he likes cats and cats make him happy.

The Skype conversation we had today just made me realize how much I miss my best friend. Our relationship wasn't just physical; I felt like I never connected with someone at this depth. We got together within the span of a week so it definitely started off as a physical attraction, but he was (is?) one of the people I had such a strong connection with because we shared the same type of humor and we could talk about anything. It was like having a best friend I was also physically and sexually attracted to. It's the ideal; it's what everyone looks for in a partner. 

I don't know if I miss him because I still have feelings for him or because I miss the routine and the ease of having him in my life. All I know is that I'm lonely, I'm weak (because after I hung up over the Skype call, I asked him an hour later if he wanted to Skype again) and I miss my best friend. 

***Tentative future circumstances:*** Distance is the only reason why we broke up so I still have thoughts at the back of my head that if I manage to get to country B and be with him, that our relationship would resume. It's terrible and wishful thinking, but I have a job interview in about a week as a flight attendant and if I do pass, my job would require me to fly into country B, into his city. I feel that if this all falls into place, we could get back together. Disclaimer: he's not the only reason I want to be a flight attendant, but it's one of the overarching reasons. I have a very romantic worldview because I think that if this does happen, fate is helping us get back together.

My friend had sex with her guy but I was told that the girl I was talking to made out with her guy but turned down sex because of me. That was at least what my friend was told. 

To be honest it felt nice to know she cared about me enough to turn down another guy. I talked to her about it and she told me she did some stuff that she didn't feel great about but as far as I knew she turned down another guy for me. She never got into detail and my friend only said she turned the guy down. She did say that this girl may not have been the best for me and that I should maybe cut it off but I didn't bother doing that. 

I kept talking to this girl and eventually had sex with her. It was a week later that my friend found out from me that I had sex with this girl. She got absolutely irate at me and I had a pretty bad argument with her. It was during that argument that my friend came out and told me that girl had fucked that guy she was with that night. It absolutely drained me and took the life out of me. I didn't even feel like she cheated on me because we technically weren't dating. But I was more upset about the fact that she wasn't honest with me. I was really pissed and decided then and there to end it. I texted her and told her that I couldn't trust her at all. I didn't need a dishonest person in my life. She said that she assumed that my friend had told me but my friend hadn't. Not only that, after sex, she had told me how it had been months since she had gotten laid. She knew she fucked up but wouldn't admit it and took the low road in not telling me.

Compared with our friends, we're probably the happiest couple among them. We are best friends. And our sex is great, most of the time. Sometimes I still feel bored having sex with the same person, and want to try it with a different person, but I can't help feeling that way, its like part of my instincts. I just wanted to have sex, and my wife was not here, and won't be back for a long time, so I figured now was the time to try it with someone else, and I liked it. I may even do it again.

So should I tell her and dissolve my marriage? Or should I keep it a secret? What would you do if you found yourself in this situation for whatever reason? Has anyone here cheated and managed to keep it a secret from everybody? Are you still married/dating? Does the guilt eat at you or are you okay with it?

76465,Breakups,1tgngy,"My on-off boyfriend of over 2,5yrs was finally diagnosed with depression a few months back, and we've both been battling it a lot longer. Yesterday though, I finally decided I've had enough. A week ago we saw each other every day and felt really close and I felt like finally we could work things through... I don't see how. The following week he didn't contact me on his own at all, he did answer my texts but felt very distant again with no forewarning. I just can't take this anymore.

I promised I'd be there for him, but I don't think I can. Pretending like everything's okay for a week, then not hearing from him for a week.. also, I know he's not alone in the meantime: he does see his friends, but apparently I'm different than his friends. Whatever that means. Sometimes I suspect he uses his depression as an excuse for whatever bullshit behavior he decides to pull.

Well, anyway. Yesterday after talking on the phone for like 10 minutes trying to understand if he was mad at me or why he's been acting so strange, I felt so bad I cried and he didn't really react at all. I had a long talk with one of my friends, and with her encouragement I wrote him a looong message explaining everything and trying to make it sound like I don't blame him but I just can't take his moody behavior anymore. He didn't answer me at all.

I feel like shit, but this is finally the point where I can't see how these things could be fixed by sticking together even if it hurts. What's the use trying to forgive all the shit that happened in the past if he still acts like a jerk and all these bad things just keep piling on? It's better for both of us in the long run. And hey, who knows - maybe in the future, when we've both grown and forgiven and forgotten all about these things, maybe we can find each other again.

I feel like a bad person for not being able to be there for him anymore, but this has really taken a toll on me and I'm tired of crying and always having to wonder if something's up or not. I just really hope I made the right choice.

183960,Relationships,2v9xs8,"My girlfriend (22) of a year and a half graduated college in December and I (22, male) am graduating in May, however it is proving difficult to find jobs in the same place. Long distance is not an optimal choice for either of us, but we are very much in love and want to be together. Her having a new job, maybe even in a different state while I am still in school is also a definite possibility. She wrote the following a few nights ago and wanted to share it with hopes of advice anyone else has from a similar experience. 


""My head and my heart are feuding for many different reasons. First and foremost, I need a job. I am desperate for a job. A big girl, full-time, engineering job. I have applied to jobs around the world hoping for an opportunity to come my way. An opportunity has presented itself in the form of an interview to work for the South Dakota Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR). I am excited about this because I have been applying and applying and applying to entry level engineering jobs hoping to hear back from one of them. Now that I have an interview, I am getting more and more terrified of the possible outcomes. Of course, I could not get the job, which would be unideal. I could also get the job, which would be unideal. Why? Because I have a very important person to consider when making a life-changing decision: Nathaniel, the man I truly see myself spending the rest of my life with. He graduates in May with a degree in aerospace engineering, and I'm sure he'll get offered a job somewhere like Texas or Washington where there are big aerospace companies like Lockheed Martin and Boeing. I want him to work for one of those companies because that's what he wants to do. I don't necessarily have a place I want to work. I want to be with him, but I also want to be employed. There really aren't any aerospace opportunities in South Dakota. See my dilemma?


Another feud between head and heart: the next step in our relationship. My practical brain explains that we have only been together just under a year and a half. Yes, we live together, and yes we adopted a pet together (our sweet kitten Chester), but it makes sense to be with someone for at least three years to make sure you really want to take that huge step together. My fluttering heart on the other hand wants to jump in with both feet and get engaged. Our relationship has moved quickly thus far. We started dating two weeks after meeting, and we said 'I love you' just two weeks after that. Everything in our relationship has come easy, it's been comfortable, honest, and full of love. I regret nothing about the pace of our relationship. It feels like it would be natural to get engaged. But neither of us are financially independent. Neither of us knows where we will be living or working by the end of this year. We don't know if we want to date long distance until something better and more permanent comes along. There is so much uncertainty in our future that it doesn't make sense to get engaged. But just try to tell my heart that...


So, what's the next step? Hope for job opportunities in the same city or even the same state so we can be close together. If that doesn't happen, which it likely won't, then I have no idea. I've never been fond of not being in control of a situation. I really do not like having no control over my immediate future. I think the reason my heart is so eager to take the plunge with Nathaniel is because it would be a constant in an otherwise chaotic period of time in my life. But of course, I feel as though if we got engaged, I would not be ready to get married. Actually, I know for a fact I'm not ready to get married. We need to be independent, have some roots somewhere together, be mentally ready for what married life will bring. Neither of us is ready for that kind of responsibility or change. We need some adult life experiences, like jobs and big moves, to give us courage and prepare us for what life will bring. 


Naturally, I have come to a fork in the road. Which path do I take? Which one is better, more practical, more exciting? I have no freaking clue. All I know is that I want to be with Nathaniel as much as I want a successful career. 


So now what?""

47113,Relationships,1z7oo3,"So, I've been in a LDR with my SO for about 1 and a half year. There were ups and downs, but we struggled somehow through it and we're comfortable with each other. I have another issue with him, but I'll make a separate post for it, as I don't want this one to get too long. (NVM, changed my mind)

Recently with the revelations about NSA (please be informed about this before commenting) I've decided that maybe it would be best if we could encrypt our messages that we send to each other, to at least maintain  confidentiality. We e-mail ourselves each day, and in most of our e-mails we talk about private stuff, our daily lives and so on, and I don't feel comfortable knowing that I am, or might be in the future spied on, or a third party could be snooping on our talks. (regardless of it being the NSA or somebody administering the mail servers, yes, they have access and are able to read the e-mails)

So I tried to teach him how to encrypt our e-mails and such, he really did try and he succeeded, but he said he wasn't happy about it. He said he tried to go through this because he loves me but he thinks this isn't necessary. From this point on he got aggravated, and started asking me where does this lead to? also saying things like: I'm just a normal citizen, I'm nobody important, I have nothing to hide, I don't know if they are actually spy on me, and I don't care anyway I can't live constantly worrying if they spy on me, it would completely change the way I act and this is much bigger than me.
He then went to say that he's concerned about me for the fact that I'm getting too paranoid or that I'm over-thinking things. I tried to assure him that this isn't a conspiracy theory and it actually happens all over the world. He said he didn't mean to call me a conspiracy theorist.

He also worries that I might take it one more step ahead after this and perhaps take other precautions. I assured him this is all I want to do and all I ask of him. I also told him I don't want to live in a balloon or be overly concerned with who's tracking my moves, I just want to have some confidentiality in our e-mails, an assurance that nobody but us two read the messages.

I don't really understand why he reacted like this, but I tried to explain to him as nicely as I could that I did this only because I'm concerned about his privacy, and mine too. Also that it isn't such a big deal, people have been doing it for quite a lot of time now. I also wondered and asked him why he isn't concerned about his privacy as he usually is. He's very shy and quite cautious about what he tells people, most of the time he isn't straight out transparent to me. He then tells me that he does value his privacy, and he's not willingly letting people spy on our chats. I try to explain to him that him willing or not to let others spy on him is irrelevant, and won't stop people from doing it if they can or have a motive to. I don't know, I feel he's contradicting himself, and I feel he's making me out to be paranoid, which I'm not, I just informed myself on this subject...

And besides this, I didn't even force him to do this... so I really don't know why he reacted like this, and he won't tell me (perhaps he doesn't know himself). What I can take out of this is that either he's misinformed about something, he misunderstood what I said or I scared him with either my actions, thoughts, or presenting him what's happening...

I love him very much, and I don't want to force anything on him or insist on this too much, but I worry a lot for him not caring. I feel like he's putting himself in a dangerous place by doing that. And this isn't the only important thing that he doesn't care about...
How do you guys think I should handle this? Do you think I did the right thing? I don't see anything wrong in what I did, but I want to hear you guys/gals what you think about this. Thanks for reading this, and sorry for the long story.

We've been through a lot together, including having a child (now 13 months old). I can't help but feel an overwhelming sense of frustration and sadness every morning I wake up, and it seems like every day I question whether or not to stay in this relationship. 

We bicker every single day about everything and anything. We used to have large fights twice a week or more. The only reason we haven't continued to fight that way is because I have become too tired and burnt out to fight back so I just listen to him bitch about everything he thinks I do wrong. I feel that he is insensitive and controlling, and has an innate ability to make me feel insignificant and stupid. It seems I could literally write a book with all our problems but I will spare the nitty gritty details. 

We have tried talking to each other. We have tried trying harder. We have (in the first year of our relationship) tried separation to see if that would have any affect on things. Nothing seems to work. He and I have had moments when I've asked him if he thought that our best just wasn't enough for each other. Or what if we just aren't compatible anymore? He shrugged it off each time I brought it up. I am not sure I even have romantic feelings for him any longer. The conflict and chaos seems to have clouded this feeling for me anyways.

Background: My BF and I have been dating for about a year and a half.  I recently moved into college as a freshman while he is a senior in high school. The college I'm attending and the high school are only 30 miles apart, a 45 minute drive on a slow day. There haven't been any problems in the relationship and overall I'm quite happy.

HOWEVER his parents are driving me insane. I don't know how to tell him this without sounding like a raging bitch but it's gotten to an unbearable level. We can't call each other on the phone, FaceTime or Skype unless his parents are within earshot and supervising. He's not allowed to visit the city where my college is AT ALL unless his parents drive him up (he has a license and his own car) and even then they want to wait outside my dorm so they'll know we didn't stay in my dorm room for too long. 

This is the last year we will be in such close proximity (he will most likely go to a college ~3 hours away from me next year) and I really just want to see him as often as possible. I've already visited him once and am going home again this weekend, but I know that his parents will insist on me coming over to their house if we want to hang out at all.

I don't want to be alone to have intimate relations; I really just want to cuddle and watch netflix without his parents sitting 10 feet away.

We ended things. It was pretty mutual but he said some pretty hurtful things so I had/have a bad taste in my mouth after the whole thing. 
Things kind of went down right before thanksgiving and I hadn't heard from him since then. After we ended I asked him not to contact me and to give me space and he said he would, the next day he texted me 6 times (all went unanswered). So I just felt like he didn't really respect my boundaries and it took him a week of me ignoring him to get the picture across.

I was so surprised because I had deleted his number (I remembered his area code) but I kind of knew that he would text again eventually.

We have been close friends and colleagues for 2 year and are now dating since 1 year. It's a wonderful relationship and we love each other very much. We are both expats in Belgium. I'm from Germany and she's from Indonesia. Meanwhile we are no longer direct colleagues. 

I knew from the beginning that her family is traditional muslim from East Java and would not allow that she dates before marriage. Her family lives in Indonesia, except for her aunt who married a Belgium man 20 years ago and lives in a town 100 miles away from us. Her aunt is her link to her family here in Belgium.
My girlfriend is not practicing her religion here in Belgium because she says it's not part of the culture and society here. She dresses European without any veils but doesn't drink Alcohol or eat pork. We are having wonderful sex on a regular basis and are still as attracted to each other as on the first day.
So we are hiding the relationship from both her local and her far-away family and we are both getting tired of it.
Her statement has always been that if I want to seriously stay together with her then I have to marry her in Indonesia and have convert to the Islam beforehand. We could continue to live in Europe, not practicing any religion but when I'm in Indonesia, I have to pretend to be Muslim and go along with any customs and traditions.

I'm extremely insecure on my position on this.

On one side I feel that church and state should be separate and I'm grateful to be born in Germany and want my kids to be born in the same freedom of religion.  

On the other side I understand the fact that for her this is simply part of her culture. If I had been born 50 years earlier, I might have faced the same obligations here in Europe from my own family. So I'm not judging here culture or her family.

On one side I feel that I should not enable such old fashioned customs and on the other side I feel that I should not risk to loose her because I'm too attached to my own view of the world.

When I got together with her, she had just gotten out of a relationship because her then boyfriend changed his mind on converting to the Islam and marrying her because his European family didn't support it.

And by that time I told to myself that I'm not going to make the same mistake as her ex and let her get away because I'm to narrow-minded about another culture.
But then again, I cannot close my eyes to the fact that in her culture it's illegal to be gay or to loose virginity before marriage.

Any thoughts?

EDIT: Her previous relationship went on for 5 years and her then boyfriend always wanted to marry her in her custom but changed his mind in the end. They had a lot of problems prior to that as well with him travelling a lot and being unfaithful.
She did not break up with him because he changed his mind.

She is aware that I'm against converting but she still loves me and wants to be together with me as long as she can. And so do I.

**tl;dr**: My GF looks at MY ex's facebook pages regularly. Is that weird (I think it is) and should I confront her about it? I want her to know She can be honest. I'm very hard to offend.

**UPDATE**: Thank you all. I think what I learned from this was that I too do weird shit. I just forgot she is just like me. I had a moment of insecurity that I felt needed to be addressed. Talking to this community and hearing the feedback helped me logically think about the situation. Once I saw her after work, everything felt right and the love and trust Ive always had was there again. Not going to bring it up.

This evening my girlfriend was communicating with her mother about specific plans for Christmas day. 

&amp;nbsp;

We made an agreement early November that we would go to my parents for Thanksgiving and to her parents for Christmas.

&amp;nbsp;

It's important to note that we live 3.5 hours from her parents and 2.5 hours from my parents and we would take almost exactly the same route to get to either place.

&amp;nbsp;

My older brother was unable to make it to Thanksgiving. He lives a couple states away from everyone involved in this.
&amp;nbsp;

My brother was planning on visiting my parents for Christmas.


&amp;nbsp;

Partially due to this fact either my mother or myself came up with the following idea.

My girlfriend and I would still go to her parents for Christmas but would stop by my parents house briefly on the way there on Christmas eve.

I liked this idea even though it meant more driving on what was supposed to be a nice holiday break.

It's important to note that this was mentioned after Thanksgiving had already taken place.

&amp;nbsp;

Unfortunately, I got a new job that is shitty and I am now working Christmas eve from noon to 7pm. We're still going to drive to my GF's parents house that night but we decided it would be too much to try and work my parents house into the mix.

&amp;nbsp;

However, my girlfriend suggested that maybe we could just stop by my parents on our way back in the evening on Christmas day.

&amp;nbsp;

I let my mom know about the updated plan.

&amp;nbsp;

Back to tonight. My GF was communicating with her mom about Christmas dinner plans. I asked if we still planned on stopping by my parents house that evening. She replied with a non-committal answer that suggested she really didn't want to do that at all. I was already aware of her lack of enthusiasm about the whole idea of adding onto our Christmas plans but didn't realize exactly how strongly she felt.

She then preceded to tell me she was very unhappy about it and she felt like our days off for the holidays were turning into a painful ordeal.

&amp;nbsp;

She communicated how she felt we had made an agreement about Thanksgiving and Christmas plans and that I had changed them after the fact without really giving her an option to say no without being the bad guy in the situation.

&amp;nbsp;

I should point out that my GF feels like my mother is in large part behind much of these changes in planning and my GF feels yanked around by this.

&amp;nbsp;

My mother has a history of emotional and passive aggressive bullying that I have not done much to deter.

So my GF feels that I have simply allowed these undesirable holiday plans to form because I won't stand up to my mother. 

&amp;nbsp;

As a result my GF feels she would be the 'bad guy' if she asked me to put my foot down and tell my mother we won't be coming to visit for the holidays. This is even if I kept her name out of it when communicating with my family.

&amp;nbsp;


At this point I am more than happy to let my family know that we won't be visiting on Christmas anymore, that it would be too stressful or that we just can't make it work.

&amp;nbsp;

However, I don't know if that's the right thing to do. Am I just letting my girlfriend push me around? Am I just trying to appease everyone by saying yes to everyone about whatever it is they think is best?

3760,Breakups,1sioeb,"I would like some advice, help, and feedback on what to do in my situation.  The relationship itself is a bit confusing to explain without both of us sounding downright insane.

Let me start it by saying that I am currently serving in the US Army and that the man I had a relationship with is a higher-ranking man than I am (but is stationed on a different base), so the relationship was discreet, secret, and definitely NOT backed by the military in any way.  If either of us had been found out, his ass would have been in a lot of trouble and my ass would have been in a bit of trouble too.

It started last year around this time.  We had been stationed together before and not thought anything of each other and then were sent to different places.  We started talking and clicked on a deep personal level I have never clicked with anyone on before.  He seemed to get me.  We decided to meet up although we were both seeing other people and there was a high sexual tension from the moment we saw each other.

He was separated, dating another girl, and falling in love with me.  He had two children.

Anyway, long story short, we fall madly in love, he breaks up with his girlfriend, I break up with my boyfriend... intense intense love but the distance was killing us.  Not only that, but his wife lost her job and asked him if she could stay with him.  He agreed - mother of his kids.  I get it, I was fine with it.

Distance is hurting us pretty badly, we don't see each other but once a month for financial reasons and it SUCKS, but we still love each other madly.

Then I find something out that turns everything upside down.  I'm pregnant with his baby.  This is fucking bad.  If I have the kid, he gets charged with adultery, I get charged with adultery, financial problems galore, big problems with his career and mine, etc.  His wife knew about us but I'm sure she wouldn't be too happy about the whole situation either... because they haven't told their kids that they're getting divorced yet.

Anyway.  I'm pregnant with his kid, freaking out six hours away from him, wondering what to do, and crying, because I want kids so badly but what do I do if I have this child?  He's pressuring me like hell to get an abortion.  I don't like the idea of it but I see it as the only way out at that point.  I start getting attached to my baby and am really sad about getting an abortion.  I cried to him on the phone one night when I'm about 7 weeks along because I am getting the operation soon.

He flips the fuck out on me.  He is quick to anger, I know.  But I have NEVER been treated like this.  He tells me that it's the baby's life that ends or our relationship that ends.  Calls me a cunt and tells me that I'm making things hard on him and that he doesn't deserve this.  I find out that he's been sleeping with his wife (not having sex - just sleeping next to - they hate each other) and pretending to be in a relationship with his wife for his kids' sake and I can't handle it.  Pregnancy hormones get the best of me and I freak out.

I end up having the operation.  I cried for my baby on the operating table.  After the abortion, I felt empty for a long time.  I miss my baby that I never planned for.

He breaks up with me the next day.  I think he was just waiting to make sure that I got it taken care of.

He is still in my mind a lot.  I've never felt so happy and then so horrible about someone.  He calls and texts me from time to time to see how I'm doing and tells me how his kids are doing and how is job is.  I guess this is a sort-of rant post, sorry, but I really... I need some help getting over him, and getting over what happened.

It's been a month since original last post and what we've done is separate our joint account - my paycheck goes to my own account that I opened and both wife and I deposit predetermined amount to the joint account. We decided on amount by budgeting on all monthly expenses and dividing them by percentage of hers and mine earnings (yearly). I guess this works, but I still have this feeling of things not being right. I don't like the fact that I need to physically deposit checks and the fact that she still does not tell me what her pay check is (she sometimes get overtime pay and her take home pay changed because of withholding changes that we did). I guess ideally I wanted both of our checks to go into joint account and from there money being distributed to hers and mine accounts based on predetermined amount, but she does not want to hear any of that. And of course I can't push too hard because she can I just say that she will not give me check, which she tried before. Mostly in all of this a thought of a family having secrets from each other on financial level does not seat with me well. I can't shake the thought of her not being truthful with me. Shitty situation and so I am still not sure how to deal with this.

She tells me that I am overreacting with all of this and she supposedly gives me her whole check and keeps around $150 per check for her, but I am not really sure if it's the truth based on my previous findings, although she might be telling the truth now because of tax withholding adjustments. As I said, this whole notion of her not telling me the whole truth really gets to me.

In original post I asked if I can leave for awhile and still somewhat think it might be good idea, just to let her be by herself. Mainly because from time to time she would go all feminist on me and tell me how difficult women have it with taking care of kids and the house and men have it easy. Although we try to divide family responsibilities equally. So perhaps me leaving for sometime will make her realize what's going on.

People also mentioned marriage counseling, which I think might be a possible way to get through to her. What can I expect from these sessions? How long do they usually last (I know this is hard to answer as each case is unique)? What is the cost involved?

Anyway - my husband is Salvadoran. I'm american. We've been together almost 5 years now (married ~4 of those), and in the wee beginning of our relationship, he was texting a fellow co-worker of ours behind my back and even tried to kiss her. I'm over that whole issue - he's matured a lot since he was a young idiot.

So my husband's brother and father live down the street in a 2 bedroom apartment, along with my BIL's baby mama (they're not married so I refuse to call her his ""wife"") and their 8 year old. My husband sees his dad like once or twice a week - they go out to eat with our daughter, and, dependent on whether or not my FIL has the day off, sometimes my H will hang out over there at the apartment with his dad, our kid, and his nephew (the 8 year old). Sometimes my BIL is home, sometimes the baby mama, sometimes both.

Around christmas time we went over there to give nephew a gift, and to get our daughters gift from them. There was this young woman there (maybe mid 20s), wearing like PJ booty shorts and a tight wife beater, with plenty of makeup for Christmas Day afternoon. She apparently is baby mamas cousin. Zero idea if she lives with them because every time I ask my husband if he saw her he says no. Every time I ask him if she lives there he says ""how am I supposed to know?""

She hangs out with my BIL a lot though I think. They came to our place one night - it was a weekend I think - together, along with our nephew. Completely unexpected she would show up (this was late last month).

Here I am, a rapid weight gaining, frumpy American female who is 23 weeks pregnant, feeling poorly about my appearance, can't fit into cute clothes, don't cake makeup on (tho yes, I do wear minimal makeup to work). Compared to this young, huge boob, tight clothes wearing, from the same country/culture my husband is from lady, I feel like a potato. 

He's told me before, after I've asked, that she's not his type and he's not attracted to her. I'm sure he's not. I won't snoop though (his phone has a passcode anyway), I won't look through pockets or phone bills, etc. I generally trust him but why can't he just be straight with me and tell me that girl lives with his bro, dad, ""sister in law,"" and nephew? 

He swears up and down he loves me and only me and is happy with me and in our little family here, but we rarely have sex (we work opposite schedules 5 days a week and have a 3 year old that won't sleep in her own bed). When we do have sex it's really quick, there's zero foreplay (in all fairness he's been with like 3 people), and neither of us are like, chomping at the bit to initiate it. It wasn't like that in the beginning of our relationship but we don't even kiss anymore :/ 

Idk. I'm just feeling insecure and upset and paranoid and I'm pregnant and irritated and argh.

We had just begun planning our wedding when we found out that she was set to lose her financial aid for school. We talked to my parents and her mom and they all understood that unless we got married, my wife had to drop out. We didn't want anyone to know since it happened really fast and we couldn't afford to invite anyone. It was in the middle of the day on a Wednesday so no one could have really made it anyway.

We moved from the West Coast to the Northeast in June for his job. Things have been pretty stressful since then and our sex life fizzled to non-existence. I had the fantastic idea to be an asshole toward him and pout for attention. It usually worked and things would get better for awhile, but then the sex would disappear and the cycle would start again.

This brings us to yesterday. It had been a week without any physical contact (he was in Arizona Mon-Fri). I was really horny with him being gone all week so I was extra pushy and asshole-ish trying to show him how frustrated I was that he wasn't in the mood to be sexual.

This blew up into a fight where he told me that I was a terrible person and we aren't right for each other yada yada. The problem is that I was being a bad person on purpose. (Spare me the lectures, I know). I was manipulating him so that I could get more sex. 

I've apologized and apologized and he laid out a list of things that are wrong with our relationship and they're all super simple to fix. He likes ethnic food, I don't. Done. I'll eat chow mien and samosas. He likes to go out and do things, I'm a homebody. Done. I'll go out and do things. If it means that I get to keep the person who I firmly believe is the one, then I'll go to the moon and back if that's what he needs.

He had none of it. He's made up his mind and there's nothing that can be said to change it. 

So my question is what do I do? Do I fight for a relationship that I know can be good? Do I fight for the person that I love with all my heart? I know I fucked up. I know.

I met V last summer while he was visiting my town for a soccer tournament. It started as just a weekend hookup, but we exchanged numbers and continued talking after he went back home (he lives three hours away from me). We met in early August, and I was leaving for Europe to study abroad in early September. I was very clear that I was soon going to be out of the country from the start. We both wanted to see each other again before I left, so before I left I went to his town to visit him. It started out as just a couple of nights, but I ended up staying with him for six days because we were getting along so well. I really did have a great time with him and it‚Äôs one of the best memories I have of last year. 

While I was visiting him, he said that he liked me and asked me what was going to happen to us when I went abroad. I had left a long distance relationship earlier that year that had really done a number on me emotionally, and I was reluctant to get into another one again. I told him that I liked him too, and when I was in Europe I would be happy if we both kept in contact with each other and see where things go once I return home. I know I kind of gave him a wishy washy answer, but I didn‚Äôt want to get into a LDR with someone I hadn‚Äôt known for very long. He seemed okay with this answer and said he‚Äôd like to keep in touch through Skype, phoning each other, Facebook, etc. 

The day I left for Europe he phoned me when I was at the airport to say goodbye, that he had a really good weekend with me, and he missed me. Once I landed in Poland I couldn‚Äôt contact him for a few days since my phone didn‚Äôt have service. Once I got a Polish number, I texted him saying, ‚ÄúHey it‚Äôs bluebelle, this is my Polish number! Miss you.‚Äù I never got a reply. I waited for him to add me on Facebook but he never added me or messaged me. He has crazy privacy settings and only he is able to add people as friends and not vice versa, so I just sent him a message. It still says on FB that he didn‚Äôt even see it. After a week, I decided he probably moved on. I tried to be at peace with it, since we weren‚Äôt exclusive and neither of us signed up for a LDR, but I was a bit sad since I did really like him. 

On Christmas, I got a phone call. It was V. I was really surprised to hear his voice. He asked me how Europe was, how I had been, wished me a merry Christmas, all that stuff. He said that he was sorry he never phoned me earlier, but he never gave a reason for why he never tried to contact me for a few months. He said he moved to another city for work shortly after I left. He also said that he missed me a lot and asked if I would like to see him again once I get back home. The entire phone call I was almost in shock since he was the last person I was expecting to phone me. We kept the conversation pretty short because of long distance charges. He called me again on my birthday to wish me a happy birthday, said he missed me, and asked me when I was planning on coming back and if I would like to come visit him. 

I‚Äôm a bit conflicted on whether or not I should see him again. I really liked him last summer, and when I remember him I still like him. Honestly if I wasn‚Äôt leaving the country, in the summer I would‚Äôve definitely pushed for a committed relationship with him. But I‚Äôm a bit hurt that he never really contacted me aside from the two phone calls. I know we never promised each other anything, but before I left he was talking about Skyping every week and keeping in touch. I‚Äôm just not sure what to do. Do you think he‚Äôs just keeping me around as a side option? Should I try and give it a shot with him, or should I stop living in the past and look for someone else?

Well, I started feeling earlier in the semester like they didn't like me very much, with the exception of Elizabeth.  They're all nice to me, never mean, don't ever try to make me feel bad or anything.  I just feel like, of all my friends, I'm the least favorite.  The outsider.  I asked Elizabeth about it once when there was a specific example of what I meant (one of them snapping at me for asking them a question in class) and she said sometimes she felt like Greg (22M) and Hamilton (23M) (other two friends) were irritable and snippy with her, too, but it was just how they got when stressed and not personal so neither of us should worry about it.

Felt better for a while.  Elizabeth, Greg, Arnold (24M), and Hamilton share an office so they always head to class together.  I'll go over and visit sometimes, just chat with them, and it goes fine -- I try never to overstay my welcome and am conscious of not being irritating (as much as I can be).  I understand they're naturally going to be a clique because of the office situation.

However, recently Elizabeth has been hanging out a lot with Sarah (23F), the one other student who isn't in that clique.  Which is cool, nbd and all, but now Sarah (23F) goes down to class with the main group, and whenever we sit in class or at symposia or in coffee shops they all end up together and then I just take the last available seat.  On a plane trip, I literally ended up being the only one sitting alone because the others all sat with each other and just forgot about me.  

I almost think that I'm trying too hard, maybe?  Being obnoxious?  But then when I'm quiet and don't say much they don't notice (except Elizabeth) and I feel as outside-the-group as ever.  

The only other thing I can think of is that I recently won one major university award (none of them did), and then a few months later won an extremely prestigious national award and was in the news etc. because of it (pretty big deal), and maybe there's some jealousy going on.  :/  That'd be unfortunate because I try to be humble and not make a big deal about any of it and to be really supportive of them and just, well, a friend.  But maybe it doesn't matter.

My question is, should I approach Elizabeth and ask her, broadly this time, if I did something to make them not like me, or if she thinks they don't like me?  Or otherwise just confide in her that I feel unliked.  She's my best friend, so normally I'd confide in her, but considering she's part of this same friend group it could be awkward and I don't want to seem socially anxious or insecure (because I know that's unattractive in friends, too!).

I could also broadly ask her, nonspecifically, if I ever do anything annoying and if she has suggestions for how I could be a more tolerable person to be around.  (Sorry if this sounds bitter, I'm just pretty pissed about it because I'm increasingly being reminded of things they do for each other -- wait for each other outside classes, etc. -- that they never, ever do for me.)

Or should I cut my losses and try to find new friends while removing myself emotionally from this group to feel less hurt?

Like I said, she is naturally pretty, but with any effort she could look like a model.  It doesn't bother me that she doesn't spend a lot of time to make herself look her best (although I secretly wish she would put effort into it), but I come from a household that stressed to always look your best. So before I go out in public, I like to make sure I have on decent clothes and will often throw some gel in my hair and make sure I'm generally well groomed.  She constantly gets annoyed that I do this, and has said before that it makes her insecure that I have to ""get done up"" before I go out. We also have differing opinions in that I believe people subconsciously will judge you based on appearance whether they believe it or not, to which she always refutes by saying she doesn't judge people, and doesn't care what people think of her. Though its plainly obvious at points that she does pass judgement on people from time to time, and she does care what people think - that's just human nature and I don't fully understand why she feels the need to suppress those thoughts.

For that reason I partially can't stand him, because I see my own faulty behaviors in him. At the same time I care about him deeply because I understand where he's coming from and how badly he's hurting.

He's got a pretty explosive temper, complete with angry outbursts and fits of believing everything sucks and the world is endlessly shitting on him. He's aware of it, and trying to work on it, but I think the problem is causing him to make his situation worse.

Today he blew up at work, from what I gather it was a calm explosion, but he gave some ultimatums and possibly burned some bridges. If he loses his job, which due to its unstable nature is not supporting him right now, he'll be on the streets, he'll lose his car, and he'll be very very stuck in a shitty situation. He can't join the military because he had asthma, and neither of his parents can help support him. His high school degree is from a state that provides degrees not recognized in the state we live in, and he's got no college education. I've tried encouraging him to go back to school but he says that he doesn't have the time or resources to, and he makes too much to qualify for free education.

Everything I've said here about him has a negative spin to it, but that's just because the situation at hand would bring out the worst in anyone. He's actually extremely kind, considerate of others, and positive and fun...when he's not facing the prospect of being homeless and cripplingly poor.

I want to help him. I want to give him advice, or assistance. However, I find myself short on advice and resources to offer. I'd house him, but I am staying with my parents. I'd give him money to help him stay housed for another month, but my current life savings is $500 and my work is slowing down for the year.

I am also on the fence about offering support to someone who I think is somewhat responsible for their own predicament.

19/M: Ben

22/M: Robert

My brother (20/M): Richard

So, around March this year I went to a friend's surprise birthday party and by chance happened to meet Ben. We soon started dating and I was enthralled with him because of how sweet, funny and respectful he was. He's also very attractive to me, which is unusual for me because I've always found myself repulsed by men as soon as we kiss. 

Our relationship was progressing well and I was even considering having him be my ""first"". Then, he finally revealed the news that he was going to be travelling in Europe in April-June for several weeks. I understood, he'd always said travelling was something he loved. THEN, he revealed that he was leaving next year for college. I wasn't OK with that because I felt like he should have mentioned that as soon as we turned more serious. We went through a sort-of break-up before he left for Europe but continued to talk almost daily.


While he was gone, I found myself hanging out a lot with my brother, Richard, and his friend Robert. Robert's a bit shy but he quickly overcame it and we became friends, and considering he's also quite attractive, I inevitably developed a crush on him. I told Ben this to be honest and he was understandably upset but glad I told him. 


Ben got back recently so we went and met at a friend's party, which we were both very happy about and spent a lot of the time kissing in corners. We went back to my house and Richard and Robert were there too, so we were all hanging out together. Once everyone else went to bed me and Ben made out for a bit and he tried to go down on me but I refused him, since I want my ""firsts"" to be with someone I know isn't leaving right away, and he seemed a bit peeved.


Today, Robert dropped a bomb on me that while I was up getting a drink that night Ben drunkenly told him I liked him and that we should date when he leaves. When I admitted to the crush, Robert kissed me!


I simply don't know what to do. Ben and I agreed we would break up when he leaves, but he doesn't leave until the end of the summer. Does this mean I just don't meet up with him at all until he leaves? I want to tell him the truth of what happened since I think he has a right to know but I feel almost slutty for what I did, kissing two men only a few days apart without setting clear boundaries. 


Besides all this, Robert is a close friend of my brother's and I'm not sure I have a right to date him. I suspect Richard already suspects and approves because he leaves the basement to go to bed earlier than us whenever we hang out, then I see him on his computer in his room until much later in the night. Still, if I date Robert I feel like I should ask his permission and I REALLY don't know how to go about that.


Wow, if you got through all of that you're a trooper. What I really want to know is, am I wrong for what I'm doing? Should I be cutting one of them, or both of them off? I can't trust my emotions and hormones right now. I know realistically I'll be breaking up with Ben anyway but I'm not sure that gives me a pass to date Robert seeing as he's my brother's friend.


I can't stress enough how caring and kind both these men are, and I don't want to hurt either of them but I may already be intentionally. I know it seems like petty, teenage stuff but I just need one person to read this so I can get it off my chest.

190940,Relationships,1zqjbv,"I know we haven't been together long, but he (we'll call him Jake) just changed around his business a bit and now we are living together.  There's all these little things that are annoying the holy hell out of me.

First and foremost, background.  I am an emotionally stunted person. In the past I have intentionally destroyed relationships by nitpicking, alcoholism, and my depression.  I have become sober, spent a few years by myself, went to therapy, blah blah blah.  I met Jake about a year ago and we began dating shortly thereafter.  

I knew what I was getting into.  I know that he's quite stubborn and so am I.  He is very set in his ways.  First, we both have dogs.  His is very sweet, timid, never-does-anything-wrong type of dog.  Mine is a monster dog.  He chews up a lot of things, jumps up, has separation anxiety and barks a lot.  He isn't as bad as he used to be, though, and is getting so much better.  Jake treats his dog better than mine.  Because Jake mainly works from home, he is with my dog 24/7.  My dog gets into the trash? It's discipline time (nothing severe, so don't freak out. Normal dog owner stuff that I approve of.)  His dog gets into the trash?  Aww...baby boy gots in the trash! Oh noooooo. Uh ohhhhh.  No discipline what-so-ever. He will tell me without hesitation that he does not like my dog.

Second.  He's a MAJOR conspiracy theorist.  So EVERYTHING is government planned and manipulated to brain wash the masses.  All that stuff in the Ukraine?  Not real. Propaganda from the government to gain mass approval to start a war against Russia. Seriously.  He religiously watches the news at 6AM, 7AM, 9AM, 12PM, 5PM, and 9PM.  Every. Day.  and freaks out, going on long rambles that lead to no where, all without actually listening to the broadcast and what it's actually about.

Third:  My apartment complex.  When he moved in, the complex required a $400 deposit for his dog, half of which is non refundable.  He has to sit there and make them explain why then go on a ramble about being screwed and whatever.  Really annoying.  He does this in regards to EVERYTHING.  Get a ticket?  Bitch until they either give up and drop the ticket, or he goes to court to fight it.  The apartment complex called me today and said: Your boyfriend needs to keep his dog on a leash.  His response: I'll put my dog on a leash when they start enforcing the pick up your dog shit rule. 

He fights all these little things when it's way easier to just let it go.  Along with all of this, he's just annoying to live with in general.  I've worked hard to overcome my obstacles, but I feel like it's never good enough for him.  He has to challenge every thought or idea I have, making me feel like I'm not doing things right.  An example is my schooling.  I'm set to graduate next December, but he thinks I need to take classes that have no relation to the field I'm going in to because it will be a resume booster.  Sure, some business classes aren't bad, but it isn't required nor would it do much for the field I'm going into.  So why pay extra money for it?  It always ends up in an argument.  

He hates that I don't use recipes to cook. I just wing it.  Therefore, I don't cook. He gets mad that I don't cook.  Cue circle argument that never seems to end.  Edit: I should mention that he does almost all the cooking because I work and go to school.  When I cook, he eats it.  He only gets pissed about the recipe thing when he buys the cooking materials.  If I buy the food for the dish, he is fine with me experimenting. 

Outside of those flaws, the man is wonderful.  He is sweet to me, kind, open and generous.  

I just have no idea how to make a relationship last when I sit here and nitpick every last flaw of his.  It's not fair to him.  It's not fair to me.

It doesn't help that I'm in the throws of depression right now.  It doesn't help that I have a hard time forming cohesive thoughts to express.  

I want our relationship to last.  I love him dearly.  I've never had a relationship last past a year and usually it comes down to these little things that annoy the shit out of me and I break up with them over it. 

Ugh. Sorry this is so random and jumbled.

18204,Dating,3dhimd,"I met him at our university a few months back through mutual friends, and since then, we've become pretty close. We speak almost everyday, whether it's through text or Snapchat, and our convos are usually comprised of us joking around about things/people/school and saying funny things.. we're children basically

I kind of have a history of being secretly obsessed with my crush, which is TERRIBLE since it makes me dependent on said person. I don't do anything weird, but I think about him pretty often throughout the day (summer boredom and a lack of things to do makes this pretty easy). Also, we're both on the opposite sides of the country until the upcoming fall quarter in a few months.

TBH, I feel like it would be super obvious to him that I like him just because of how flustered I am around him, but ANYWAY I often feel like I'm *pushing* my friendship on him. I haven't had many close guy friends throughout my life until pretty recently (starting a few years back when I started uni), and I don't know if my behavior is seen as odd.

For example:

- I'm a pretty funny person (ugh, not meant to be a brag, it's relevant) and I joke a lot and can keep up text convos easily, so I often type more and more often than not I type a lot more than he does. He often starts text convos himself but I sense that sometimes he can't think of something equally funny and kind of changes the subject (or is this completely off base lol)

- We both are each other's number one bestfriend on Snapchat, meaning we send each other the most snaps respectively. BUT I often end up spamming him (and my other friends in general, but mostly him), which could probably get pretty effing tiring to some.

- He's a pretty shy, awkward, and not very confident individual, but is semi-outgoing once he's comfortable with someone. So, in the beginning, I was always pushing him to hang out with our friends (rarely have we met one-on-one) because he told me about multiple situations where he's felt left out (since he's not very assertive...he speaks his opinion if he wants to join in and hangout, but doesn't push it if people forget/don't accommodate). I don't know if this seems overbearing, but I literally texted him quite a bit back then to convince him to go out to things

- Sometimes when I'm drunk, I text him...things? Only once was I ever super incoherent (it was literally gibberish; I drunk text random friends, not just my romantic interests as well), but we're both pretty gossip-y so I'll text him bait-y stuff (like U WON'T BELIEVE WHAT MARTHA JUST SAID!!!) and then not respond until the next day just to get his attention. Ya... I'm annoying. And ya, I need to keep my phone locked away from me.

Now, reading back on this, I now feel like I sound like pretty obsessive. Socially, I've been pretty awkward and didn't really get many social cues until I finally started making friends in uni, so I don't really know too much about when I should back off. I've been in a LTR of 2 years in the first few years of uni, but that was more of him straight up asking me out instead of being good friends first.

I really like my crush as a friend and even if things never work out romantically, I would definitely prize his friendship, so I don't want to scare him (me asking him out would scare him if it was unrequited, so I'm never doing that lol). I have seen hints that he may like me as more than just a friend, but my magic 8 ball says its a no every time I ask about my crush, so idk WHAT to think. I have pretty low self-confidence (it's rising steadily and is higher than ever though!) and am always unsure of how I'm actually perceived by others. I've been told I'm funny (my only positive aspect tbh), and I'm guessing since he does initiate a lot of our convos that he doesn't completely hate me, but I don't know if sometimes I appear really weird...sigh.

Any advice on what's the appropriate amount of social communication I should do? How tf do you advance further when it comes to shy-er, less forward guys? What are some things I can do to nudge this a bit further without me bluntly screaming I LIKE YOU at him? I know he finds me really funny, but there's a lot more needed than just my comedic side for him to actually like me.

Here's some back story. I'm 22, she's 21, and we met when I was 20, she 18. We dated throughout university. Neither of us are religious at all, but we drew a lot of meaning from our histories and traditions. She from Christmas, me from my grandfather being a holocaust survivor.
Around four months ago I started talking about our future. My family would only really accept her if she converted, and I felt that it is what I wanted too, so that I could raise kids in a Jewish way. She really struggled with this, because she felt as though my love for her was conditional based on this. Eventually she said she couldn't do it, and we split for a day.

I immediately realized I made a bad decision, I told her I was okay with her being the way she is. My next struggle was whether or not I could raise kids in an environment with Christmas and Easter.

What ended up happening was months of discussions and tears on her end. I feel like I asked too much of her, and even after agreeing to give her these things, she felt too constrained. I wanted to talk about our future because me agreeing to a Christmas tree wasn't just symbolic; I was ready to take us seriously.

But then a few weeks ago she asked for space for a while, but wanted to keep the door open. Then a couple days ago she closed it, saying how great I was but that she has changed, she's young, and this relationship is really serious. She needs to discover herself and didn't think it would be fair to keep me waiting. She said she was waking up smiling now for the first time in a long time, and that after spending time alone she realized this was best for us. The rapid change in her decision making was due to not being able to say no to me.

She just was the embodiment of everything I was looking for, and I feel like I totally fucked up a good thing. I know moving forward would have been a challenge, but I was so ready for it. I feel guilt.

The worst part was after that conversation on Saturday, I saw her in traffic right beside me. She was crying. I rolled down my window and called her name, and I'm not sure if she heard me or ignored me, but she drove off.

I'm hurting so much. She was so good. This is so hard.

188167,Relationships,2d3kan,"My wife and I have been together for 8 years, married for 5 and have 2 children together. 
I was out with my wife and we visited a close friend of hers. We were there with about 4 other couples or so. My wife and the other women went upstairs to check out some of the new furniture. I ended up running into this guy who introduced himself as a guy who used to date my wife. At first I thought he was kidding but he proved himself as the guy. 

I never had this type of interaction before so I was visibly uncomfortable and then he started talking up my wife or so I guess to make me feel better. Of the things he said the one thing that stood out was oh boy is she a freak (when it comes to sex). I have been with my wife for 8 years, and I could say freak is the farthest thing from it. He was kind of drunk and then he starts telling me the crazy stories from the past. One of them being, having sex outside of the mall and a cop showing up. Another one was they had anal sex when they went camping and they got the tent all crazy. I stood there in front of him and I just wanted to punch this guy in the face. He tells me, well you are one lucky guy. 

The rest of the party I felt extremely uneasy, and when I saw my wife I just wanted to yell at here however I kept my cool. And then I ended up talking to her when we got home the next day. I started asking her about Dough (not his real name). I could tell by her face she had to catch herself when I mentioned him. She started asking what did I know what did he tell me. I told her I want to know more and her this guy‚Äôs relationship. She told me she that it was a long time ago and she doesn‚Äôt want to talk about it. 

I started asking her about the movie theater and she wouldn‚Äôt even talk about it. The next few days this was all that was on my mind I kept trying to pry out what happened with her and this Doug guy whether it was all true. Long story short, she ended up confessing to all of this and more. What makes me really upset is that when it comes to sex, my wife and I‚Äôs sex life is not horrible. But it‚Äôs never what her and Doug‚Äôs relationship ever was. I asked her why she wanted to do those things with him but never would even try them with me, she told me that he forced her to do those things or he would leave her. However, after some more talking she ended up saying that at the time she enjoyed doing those things but she no longer wants to do them. When I pressed further about why, she told me that I am lucky she has sex with me now. 

For us, I don‚Äôt think she has ever given me an actual blow job, she will put my penis in her mouth for 5 seconds and move on. I have asked her if she could make more of an effort she always says she isn‚Äôt a slut. Same thing when it came to other things. She knew I always wanted to try anal sex, even when we were dating. She said that it is exit only, and always will be. 

Our sex life really lacks frequency and she always chalks it up to her having a naturally low libido. However, from what she had with Doug, they supposedly went at it all the time. She knew I was hurt by all this, but never really made a change at any of this. I know steaming over this really won‚Äôt do me any good however I really feel bad. The fact that she did all these things with this other guy but not me. I know to a lot of people sex doesn't mean much to them however for me sex is a really big way on how I feel loved. I was okay staying with her but I was under the presumption she didn't do those things for anyone else, that she was just sexually reserved. However, I now know that to no longer be the case. And just to clear this up that wasn't present on the other thread, it's not like we had a wild sex life when we were younger either. 

The thing which really gets at me is that this Doug guy is in many ways a loser/redneck type guy. He continuously complained that all of his bosses were assholes. He even boasted about going to prison for punching his boss in the face.

Since this whole incident my wife and I haven‚Äôt been intimate. She has tried to initiate a few times but I am so angry and upset with her I can‚Äôt say yes. Am I wrong for being upset? Is this type of behavior normal where a woman will be sexually adventuruous with guys that she doesn‚Äôt settle down with? Is there something that I am lacking? I have heard from other people that women see guys in two different ways, guys who are made for fucking, and guys that they settle down with. Does this mean she isn‚Äôt really attracted to me?

**tl;dr** - Ran into a guy at a party found who used to date my wife. He told me that he and my wife used to have wild and crazy sex. I confront my wife she confirms the story. I am upset because she did a lot of things for him that she never did for me.

168606,Relationships,2fpexb,"This situation has been going on/ building for a while now, but things hit an ALL TIME LOW today. I'm extremely raddled and frankly don't know how I should handle this situation. Here it goes: 

Bf Background: My BF and I have been dating for 2.5 years and have a truly awesome, supportive relationship. He's not just my bf, he's my best friend and we both deeply trust and respect each other... We basically live together now, I sleep at his house every night while we wait for the lease on old apt to run out (also part time sublet it for extra $) 

House Keeper Background: She is more than just a maid, she is also like a second mom to my bf, helped raise him as a live in nanny growing up (he comes from an effluent background). She comes to the our every two weeks to clean and do laundry. We both work insane hours so the house isn't always in greatest shape when she comes aka dish, trash, clutter, bed not made etc (normal messy... not like a hoarder or anything weird/crazy). 

Verbal Abuse/Main Issue: She is very old school and thinks that as the woman in the house it's my job to be a home maker and clean up after my BF at all times (I work 60 hours a week, so no way) when she gets to the house she immediately starts yelling about how ""I'm not a real woman, I'm a dog"" ""I'm not good enough for her baby, I need to learn to be a real woman"" ""I'm disgusting"" ""get out of this house you make me sick"" etc. she has thrown my shit on the ground, will wash &amp; fold his clothes, while washing and leaning them crumpled in a pile on the floor (ruined several dresses). BUT only if my BF isn't at the house does she yell these things at me, if he's there she acts totally different. He's confronted her about this when I've told him in the past but she just down plays it saying oh she must have miss understood ""she's so sensitive, of course I love her I would never"" which he then buys. Or she even blames me for causing her job to be harder. 

I understand why it's hard for him to except, she like close family to him and only sees good side of her (""no one else has ever had any issues with her"") he's asked me to try and be bigger person and be more friendly to her bc she's getting old (I also tried, but kind of hard when someone is yelling calling you a dirty dog). 

Today was worst episode yet. I can't  handle it any more I want to ban her from the house but my bf still won't full accept what I'm saying about what happened is real, that there has to be some other factor at play that helped set her off and that I he thinks I'm  also at fault in the situation in some way. I'm exhausted from it, it's ruined my whole weekend so far and am just a mess. One thought I had was video tapping the event next time she's here so there is pure proof... That or just avoiding the house any time she's here which also sucks (feel like she's going to mess with my stuff). 

Any thoughts? I'm miserable. :(

70378,Non-Romantic,2u3yfb,"My mum and Paul had me when mum was 17 and Paul was 20. My mum told me that Paul wanted her to have an abortion but mum wouldn't have one. Instead they moved in together and tried to raise me as a family. I get the feeling when mum talks about him that he was like her first big love. They went through a lot of fights and trouble before Paul finally walked out a couple of months after I was born. Paul saw me every couple of weeks or so but this fizzled out. He stopped visiting and my mum offered him an out which he took. He offered to pay child support but she refused, they both agreed to cut the other out of their lives and pretended that the other didn't exist. I'm not sure of the full story here of why this happened as it upsets my mum when I bring it up. 

My mum has basically raised me by herself with the help of my grandparents and she has gave up so much for me and tried to make sure that I have the best life possible. I love her to bits and although I can't help wondering about Paul seeing as he lives in the same town, I get on with my life and be thankful that I have at least one brilliant parent. We live in a small town who pretty much know who my dad is but mum is stubborn and she refused to move away. Due to living so close to him and everyone knowing she has told me the story from an early age so I have always known. I've basically grew up knowing that my birth dad lives a few miles from us. He's married now with three kids, the eldest is only a couple of years younger than me. I always see him from afar but we've never talked. 

A couple of days ago Paul messaged me on Facebook. It was something like Hi, my name is Paul, I don't know how much you know about me but I would like us to get in touch. I completely understand if you don't want to. I was really floored by this as there's like an unspoken agreement between our families that we pretend Paul and my mum never happened. I don't know why he suddenly wants to reconnect and I'm a bit wary. Mum gets upset when I bring up the past so I don't feel like I can talk to her about it. I haven't answered him yet but I can't stop thinking about it. I've never felt like I lacked anything with my mum but of course I've wished I had a dad like everyone else and I'm jealous when I think of the family he now has. My girlfriend thinks it's a great opportunity, things and people change and I shouldn't let it pass by me. I would really appreciate help on how to respond to him as I can't think straight at the minute.

Although reddit seems to be very pro-divorce, pro-independence for the individual in most relationship threads... There is pretty compelling evidence in many books/studies that kids of divorce have a tougher go at life, lacking the stable family.  Discomfort in trusting others in relationships, and generally more problems than families that stay together.   (Read Legacy of Divorce or Sandcastle program for kids of divorce for starters)

That said, doesn't it make more sense for couples to come up with ways to make it work by allowing one another to move on romantically while keeping the family base together?  Especially if there isn't abuse, you're generally friendly to each other, can work out things as a team and even occasionally don't even mind sleeping with one another? 

Obviously one size does not fit all.  But with women being more independent and seeminly just as interested in passion, romance and SEX as men.  Doesn't this seem like a good solution for many parents that want their kids to grow up healthy, and to not sacrafice so much of yourself that life is miserable.

135342,Infidelity,25jp8e,"Shortly after breaking up with a girlfriend of 2 years I was getting pushed by my friends to go out with them. I refused up until one night my friends asked if I want to go out to clubs and spend a night with a group of three girls. We were a group of three guys and well I felt obligated so I tagged along reluctantly. 

This is when I met Alicia. We went to a couple clubs and it ended up everyone pairing off. I was matched with Alicia mainly because she had a boyfriend and I wasn't ready for anything to start since it had only been a couple weeks since my break up. The club thing happened then us guys got invited back to the girls hotel this is where it starts.

We arrived back at the hotel and Alicia went to change. Looking across the room there were only 2 beds. My two friends and their dates grab them. Now I am a bit lost and looking back I see Alicia come out in yoga pants and a tee shirt. No make up no heels and just then I noticed how beautiful she really was. Without the heels she was about 5'2, super thin and just absolutely adorable. She scurry's past me grabbing my hand and pulling me to the large window. This window had a huge window sill sat us both comfortably. It overlooked Providence (the city we were in).  It was a picture perfect view you could see all of downtown. We sat there for a minute and started talking right away. 

My ex came up pretty quickly since one of my friends mentioned it. I explained to her the break up and Alicia seemed genuinely sad for me. I was almost in tears, this is when she came over to my side of the sill and comforted me. She claimed everything would be ok and just made me feel... wanted. I asked about her boyfriend and she wouldn't get into great detail. Almost like it was the unbreakable wall but what I got out of it was he very unappreciative and never wants to see her anymore. We jumped topics after that to things like school work, everything possible.

At one point she made a comment she wrote poetry. Me being me I was so ready to read it and just get a deeper insight to her. She seemed willing and so I read it. This is when she said something along the lines of ""I hate sharing my poetry but something about you make me want to share it with you"". Just the fact she opened up to me like that made her so much more attractive. Oh and the poetry was rather good.

By 5am both of us knew we needed sleep but by this time we were the last ones up. I remember I laid down alone on the floor for no more than 10 minutes then got up claiming I couldn't sleep. I told her I would stay up with her till she was tiered. I saw a small smirk like she was happy that I did that. Even though inside I knew I was forcing my eyes to stay open. We sat on the window sill for about 20 minutes then I laid back down expecting to be sleeping alone. She tossed me a pillow and cuddled right up with me. 

We spent what was left of the night laying on the carpet. We spooned and all I could think of was my ex. Alicia kept looking up at me and apologized multiple times for nothing. Just to make me feel better. She did some of the most adorable things. She noticed i was like upset and she just reaches up and runs her hands through my hair, borrows her head in my chest, plays with my hands against her small hands, just all these little things. Any man would be lucky to have a girl as beautiful and caring and thoughtful as someone like her.

The next morning we woke up and I saw her still laying next to me and gave her a kiss on the head. She looked up and me and I made a plea for a kiss. She did turn me down though because of the boyfriend. I lent over and was biting her neck and ears. She did enjoy that though and just had a huge smile. My friends and I had to leave rather abruptly though the next morning. As I was getting up she asked for my phone I handed it to her having no clue what she was doing. She put her number in my phone I got a hug and was on my way. 

Looking back now I have no idea what she thought of that night. We never really did talk about it much after that. 

Now five months later I still think about her every night. With that night running through my head. She is still with the boyfriend. He doesn't appreciate her not to the slightest. I have been out with her one time since and that night was equally as amazing. I currently only talk to her in sprees like a couple days then stop for a week then a couple days. I have been out with other girls since. Sadly I always compare them to her and cut it off. I just need opinions, should I keep fighting for this fairy tale ending I have set in my head? Or should I just move on.

23362,Relationships,2nizme,"Long story short I am going out with my boyfriend 3 years now, living together properly for 5 months. 

We were always an unusual couple but I love him and I love us. We are fiery and joined at the hip and very alike but we've also worked on every issue and worked through it. However when he quit his job I feel like the roles changed and he lost a little of himself. The arguments got worse and that's when I started to feel the pressure. His frequent but not quite a problem drinking didn't help.

We moved in in July and he got a new job, all seems good. In August he gets sick, not serious but out for a week. Then he had holidays, then the following week he tells me he thinks he has depression. He gets medication and sick certs because I can't support us on my wages and our rent. The certs enable him to get paid by the government, he just has to hand them in once a week. He hands in 2 under duress and then just doesn't bother. 

At the end of the month, Sept, he says he's not ready to go back to work. I say fine but you have to go on welfare, he decides to go back to work. Long story short 2 weeks later he's still out of work and decides he wants to go back to college. Another month passes where I don't know what happened to be honest but I feel like we were just getting by.

Finally his brother moves in to help with rent &amp; bills and my partner does a security course. He has one job lead, as of today it has unfortunately led nowhere. He seems to have no intention of getting a job and I know part of this is linked to his depression but its getting out of hand.

We argue, that's ok but there's been so many now, started by both of us. Our sex life is practically non existent. I understand depression, I am going to see if I can take anything because by god, I'm sick of struggling. I'm sick of crying and being under pressure to keep us afloat. I love him dearly but I've been under so much pressure with work and money that I feel like I can't feel anything anymore.

The kicker is his brother is proving to being a cheeky little shit with bills, paying at the end of the month. We had another argument tonight and I asked him to leave as I couldn't physically have another fight. What can I do to get us through this or do we have too different a view on life??

88572,Relationships,1lpxml,"My girlfriend and I have had a pretty solid relationship over the last few years (3 on October 1st). Historically the only issues we truly had were her overbearing parents (she lived at home and her doting father was the classic strict-Catholic type). They disallowed spending the night anywhere, so basically we couldn't do weekend trips (on a few occasions when they were with us or it was to her sister's apartment) and I had to have her home by curfew (2 AM). She was also disallowed from coming to my apartment when I lived out of town - which we lied about and she would come anyway... but the curfew was still in effect. We almost never missed a weekend to spend time together.


The only other issue we really had was my problem with vocalizing my emotions to her - falling into the usual ""I love you"", ""I miss you"" pitfall and not much else. I told her I loved her daily, always. But she would dote on me constantly (which I loved). And would always reciprocate... my personality just couldn't match her enthusiasm, I feel like.


She was then laid off from her job. And It all happened very fast - she was a wreck after losing the job and applied everywhere (a bunch of places we had talked about wanting to move eventually). I went away for a weekend and when I came back she came by and wanted to talk - she had applied to a job 11-12 hours away (a place I had previously said I didn't really want to move a year or two prior. But she had relatives and vacationed there... she loved the area). She wanted to know that I was with her on this and didn't want this to affect the relationship (she did also mention she didn't want the relationship to prevent her from getting a job). In my typical, calm (she may call it disinterested) fashion I told her I was with her on it - and that we'd be fine. She was excited and I didn't want to ruin that for her. And I was looking for new jobs anyway, figured I'd get a job and move there anyhow. But considering everything, I wasn't extremely excited.


It's just going on about 3 weeks now (she left the 14th of August, she's a teacher and their orientation began on the 20th). And we maintained contact that was pretty similar to when she lived here (texting, chatting online... we were never phone people)... I missed her, for sure, and I told her that often. I guess the impact hadn't totally hit me - my friends brought me out on the weekend, and she was mingling as well. And I was kind of angry at her - I felt abandoned, even though I supported her through it.


10 days ago she sent me a drunk voice mail - about 1:30 seconds of her telling me that she misses me. And I texted her the next day with my usual good morning, and that I got her voicemail and enjoyed it. Things seemed okay, she mentioned that she missed hearing my voice... and wanted me to be more specific about *how* I missed her. Which, now it's clear to me, but then I took it to heart... but I don't know, not enough.


We talked on Skype last Friday and she revealed to me that she had been getting along well with a coworker (fellow English teacher, across the hall from her) and realized she had feelings for him. I was just blown away. I asked her what kind of feelings, and how strong - she didn't know, she was just confused about it. And went on to say that she felt bad for leaving me behind, missed me, and felt like a jerk for feeling like this especially after what I put up with while dating her (issues with her parents being overbearing). I kind of passed the feelings off, ""Well, there's billions of people in the world..."" kind of thing. Things never got heated - just remorseful, I guess. Said our ""I love yous"" and went to bed so she could make her flight the next day for her sister's bachelorette party. The whole weekend we texted and exchanged photos, never bringing up the other guy... even though I couldn't get it out of my head. I even offered/suggested that I drive over and meet her for breakfast or something while she was there - only a 3 hour drive for me. She thought it was sweet, but probably not a great idea because of the bachelorette party.


I called her last night. And we aired it out. She feels like she was always so affectionate to me, and my show of affections didn't really match up, or support what she needs emotionally. She always just wanted validation from me, which I thought I was giving to her... but apparently not. I told her that I felt like I was taking her for granted (she agreed there... at least so far as being vocal about my emotions towards her). She says that if we were still physically together this wouldn't have been a problem to begin with -  says that she still loves me, can't believe we're having a discussion like this, and feels guilty for having feelings for someone else. I suggested that I come down this weekend, but she's wary of that... again, says she needs some time.


I'm upset because I truly feel that I do appreciate her (she says she knows that) but there are times that I don't voice it verbally... and ultimately she's felt worse about herself because I don't give her the kind of validation she wants. I *used* to be like this in a previous relationship, so I know I'm capable of it... I'm really just blown away because I didn't realize it was hurting her to the degree that it is. And I'm ashamed it took an event like her moving away and developing feelings for someone else to realize it. I know I'm capable of better, and I really want to prove that to her.


She says she wants things to work out. She's confused and needs time (I've seen that before). Typing this out I feel like there's so many layers that aren't being touched on, but this really is difficult for me as it is. Everything's happened so fast. I'm really just a quiet person, and internalize a lot of things. This is the only thing that's ever caused an issue for us, and it really has never gone longer than a 10 minute argument that she loves me and wants to know I do. I love this girl and never wanted to hurt her or have things end up like this.


Hopefully this is enough background. I'll fill in the blanks as much as I can.

My girlfriend of 3 years moved away abruptly, and now has feelings for another man because of my problems with verbal intimacy - the distance magnifies this issue.","My [26M] girlfriend [23M/F] of 3 years, moved to a new job 11 hours away and has feelings for another man.",0.0,False,1.0,0.0,1378309292.0,/r/relationships/comments/1lpxml/my_26m_girlfriend_23mf_of_3_years_moved_to_a_new/,Romantic
31945,Relationships,2n84sv,"Recently I started dating a guy who, for the first time in a while, I felt a real connection with. After going on a few dates was fairly obvious we both got on really well and liked each other, and it naturally evolved into us spending more time together and growing closer. 

The only issue is, is that I met him three months before heading on an overseas trip for three months. We were open with discussing our feelings for each other and what the trip meant in terms of anything happening between us, and came to the conclusion that we should keep it casual for now, and potentially see how we felt when I can back from my trip. 

However, as we carried on with our dates and started to hang out more, it became apparent that casual was going to be too hard. We both developed some deeper feelings for each other. He started telling me he was falling for me, that he saw us as growing into a long term relationship, and that he saw me as his girlfriend. I was overjoyed, because I felt the same way too. About a month before I left, despite what we had previously agreed to, we started the beginnings of a relationship. Everything was going very smoothly, and although I was about to take off overseas for three months, it seemed like it was really going to work. We were both very open with our communication, and while it seemed a little crazy to me, he was completely sure that the 12 weeks wouldn't change anything for him, and we were both equally committed to making it work. 

For the first nine weeks, things went very well. We talked every day, and put in a lot of effort to make sure the other was happy and felt secure in the relationship we'd started. We made plans for things we could do together when I got back home, and even began discussing going on a potential trip overseas together next year. Although we essentially began a relationship through long distance, it was going as well as it could and my feelings grew even stronger. 

After nine weeks, I noticed a shift in his communication with me. He began saying less in his messages, making less time to skype, saying less affectionate things and not responding when I would say affectionate things to him. The best way to describe it is he went from hot to cold very quickly. After a week of this, I brought it up in a skype call and asked if everything was ok with him, and us. He told me he was starting to have doubts and felt like he had forgotten what it was like to be with me. 

Logically, I understand how this has happened. Trying to start a relationship takes a lot of work in itself, and trying to do it long distance just seems insane. It should never have worked in the first place. Emotionally, I don't understand how he could go from being so into it to so not into it. He said he wanted to wait till we see each other before we decide anything, and we said we'd keep talking till I am but we haven't been. After our skype call I took a few days to process everything and then told him how I felt about the situation, and his response was that he was confused and needed space.  

I am back home in 2 weeks now, and am unsure of where to go from here. It is hard because it feels like we are in a limbo state right now. We really need to talk about it, but it will be much better to do it in person, when we can give each other a big hug and have a big talk face to face about it all. However at the same time, warning bells are going off in my head because he jumped to abruptly from feeling one way to another.

When we *do* go out, she is absolutely terrifying. She frequently confuses the break and gas pedals. So far, she has crashed 2 cars this way. She feels like I yell at her when she is about to, well, hit something. I pay for her to take driving lessons, which she won't schedule unless I badger her about it for days.

Here's where I'm torn - i'm about to measure her by my own stick: I could get all of those things done in a day. I could (and often do) go from CT to queens and back just to see her. I feel like she hasn't done a damned thing in weeks, and now it is vitally urgent that she go back to NYC and party with her friends on my dime, while I live with my parents in CT and commute 4 hours a day to support her. I feel that if I have to suffer out in ct with my parents so that I can pay off both of our student loans, that she should have to suffer out there with me.  
  
I know my mother can sometimes be difficult to deal with, but my girlfriend is Indian. She should be used to the idea of neurotic mothers in law.
  
Tonight, we were going to get dinner in NYC, but she has a doctor's appointment at 4, so she cant. When I called her out, she said that she fell and bumped her head yesterday, and if I want to travel to queens, we can still get dinner.

60607,Infidelity,1yf9ub,"Let me start this by saying that for our entire relationship, we've been the most loving, supportive couple ever. We still go on dates together, we laugh together and generally have a great relationship. We consider each other best friends and love each other a lot. Our friends always say how perfect we are together. I'm sure we make other people sick with our cuteness. 

Then this shit happened. 

Three years ago I did cheat on her and had sex with another girl. It was a drunken lapse of judgement and feel absolutely horrible about it. I wanted to tell my girlfriend but having known that her other ex-boyfriends cheated on her and it hurt her so bad, I couldn't bring myself to unleash that kind of pain on her. I vowed to tell her before we married (which is the plan we've spoken about), as a sort of fresh start. Three years of guilty thoughts was hard but I was still the best loving boyfriend I could be.


Then she comes home from her holiday and says we need to talk. I could tell straight away that shit was about to go down. She started with saying how she kissed another guy and how she feels so terrible about it. She told me she still loves me, made a big mistake and that she was sorry. I ask if she JUST kissed him and she says yes. 


That's when I decide to drop the bomb on her that I had cheated on her and had drunken sex with another girl 3 years ago and never told her. She now admits that it wasn't just a kiss with this guy, they had sex.


Everything is out in the open. We're both crying, hurt and confused.


**Then the topic kind of shifts.** She tells me how shes so scared that we've been together since she was 19 and we're so good together, she doesn't see us breaking up for a really really long time, which is her cute way of saying that she can see us marrying one day. She actually has mentioned this in the past but then kind of got over it. She's worried that she'll never get to experience sex with other people and I totally understand that and I don't want her to feel held back. She also says that it's not worth breaking it off with me over and I agree. We've got a great loving relationship. I mean, I'm still young and good looking too and part of me feels like I'm missing out on some experiences too you know? But this relationship is too good to give up.


We still have a lot of patching up to do but I feel like we're already on the road to building trust back up again and going back to our normal affectionate selves. We're both committed to stay together and make this work.


My only concern is that our relationship is holding her back from going and experiencing things that she wants to experience. I don't want this to lead to her betraying my trust again and cheating. 


**Is it even possible to maintain a healthy relationship where we do sleep with other people? I'm open to it but I am worried there might be damaging side-effects to the relationship. Maybe we can set some boundaries and rules. I don't know. Does anyone have any experience with this?**

We both admitted to each other that we cheated. It was drunken meaningless sex but it still hurts. We both agreed to stay together and work through this.

Is it even possible to maintain a healthy relationship with someone and sleep with others?

153036,Relationships,2lxq4f,"'ve been dating my boyfriend for over 2 years now. We have gone through a lot together: long distance stints, my 6-8 month sickness, his near-death car accident, graduations, new jobs, etc. etc. Lately we have been talking about a future. 

My brother met my boyfriend, let's call him **Sam**, before we even started dating. They always got along. At my best friend's wedding, Brother and Sam talked quite a bit, and Brother showed concern at Sam's recent accident, and asked him how he has been doing. They ran into each other a few weeks later, and it was all cool.


About a month later, my parents (in front of my brother) started asking me about my plans to marry Sam. This was the first time we were talking about this topic openly in front of my brother. I said Sam and I would like to get married in a couple of years, and that we will start to get to know each other's families. Brother shows concern when he learns that Sam is not a Canadian citizen (he is a Permanent Resident though, so marrying me would not give him any special access to citizenship or anything). I thought it was weird but just let it go. 


Fast forward a few weeks, and Sam is sick and has to go to the hospital at night. He goes to a hospital near my place, and since he has no family here, my dad and I stay with him until 4am. We ask him to just come home and stay with us instead of taking an hour to go back to his place (it was far and he **does not have a car**). He says no at first, but my dad insists, so he stays. When my brother later finds out that this happened, his tone is very rude, and he was almost sarcastically mocking Sam's need to go to the hospital, it seemed. I was really confused. 


Now, in September, my parents decided to invite Sam over to my house while we were having a party with several family friends. Sam comes over, brings a gift for the family, is doing everything right and getting along with everyone. For some reason **my brother does not talk to Sam the whole time**. Instead, he leaves the room and goes upstairs to his room for 15 minutes, and then goes and sits with our other cousins. Sam notices but doesn't really make a big deal out of it.

I was very hurt by my brother doing this. My mom also noticed that he was showing attitude to Sam so she talked to him. Apparently, my brother has the following concerns and does not like Sam: 

*  Sam is 27, a professional, has been working for 2 years now, but does not have a car yet. So sometimes I drop him off (if it is convenient only)

*  Sam does not have Canadian citizenship 

*  Sam supports his family financially 

*  He is ""shy"" 

*  Sam doesn't have his own apartment yet 


Basically, for all of the above reasons, Brother feels that Sam has yet to ""prove himself"" to our family. I personally don't care about all of the above things. I love him, and I know our future is financially secure because of our educational and professional backgrounds. 

We are now in this awkward time where I know Brother hates Sam, but nothing Brother says will make me change my mind about Sam. I am also so hurt by Brother being so judgemental about Sam, that I really don't have the emotional energy to talk to Brother directly. I'm scared I will get angry or start crying and get really upset if I have to confront this head on. 

My parents say that my brother is just going through a phase, is young (he is 21), and doesn't realize that he is wrong. They say some of his concerns are valid (he should have a car, in their opinion), but think these things will resolve with time. They love Sam. 

How do I deal with this? I want Sam and Brother to get along like they did before he found out he is not a Canadian citizen. I think Brother is being judgemental, and it angers me to see that he is thinking all of these things about Sam, without even putting in the effort to get to know him. If he knew how hardworking Sam is, Brother would never judge him for not having these material things yet. Brother is concerned Sam can't take care of me, is not man enough, and hasn't ""proven himself"". 

I personally think Brother is realizing Sam and I are serious, and is starting to get jealous.

She got a new boyfriend almost immediately (I assume she cheated, but doesn't matter anymore). I initiated NC then and broke around 10 days later after she begged me to talk to her again. We talked every now and then and she came home and cheated on her boyfriend with me a few times. All throughout this time, she kept telling me that she loves me (I believe to keep me interested).

I initiated NC again back in March or so to no avail because I felt bad after she called me crying and begging me to keep talking to her. I tutored her through skype until May where I got out of school and went to her school to help her study for finals (terrible decision, I regret it completely). Same story as before with her cheating on her boyfriend with me. 

Fast-forward to this Monday, she came home to renew her driver's license (turned 21) and apparently to see me. We hung out Monday and drank with some friends. She started talking about hooking with some people at her school, to which I got upset and left the room, drank alone, and burnt everything that she ever gave me after I told her I didn't want her to stay the night with me. I ignored her for most of Tuesday until around 11pm where I told her I don't think we should hang out Wednesday (the day she's leaving). I then initiated NC again a few hours ago. I just have to drop some of her things that she forgot here.

We thought I just needed to eat something, so we went to get some food, but I ended up throwing up in the parking lot.  It hit me really fast so I texted my bf to let him know I got sick (he was sick last week) and that I was going home. He then offered to bring me some soup, pepto, and sprite. I expected him to be at my apartment fairly soon since he was a couple streets away.


About 45 minutes later I call him and he declines the call. I was really confused. he then proceeded to tell me I was being super needy and impatient. Maybe I came off as needy, but I was in so much pain and just wanted some medicine, etc., and comfort from a SO would've been nice too. He ended up not even coming over because ""when I act like that and call him so much, it pushes him away and he doesn't want to be around me."" I called him within an hour. I told him I will never forget how I felt today and he said it's not that important because ""i always come crawling back.""


This felt like a flashback from a couple weeks ago when I got really sick and he decided he didn't want to be there for me and went out of town instead. I KNEW he wasn't out of town yet but he said ""it was a consequence for being bitchy to him the previous day."" I have never felt more alone that day. My friends were all either at work, out of town; my family lives out of state; he was all I had.


In between these two incidents, he was sick. I brought him food, held him, gave him massages, hung out with him and his family, basically whatever he needed I was there. He would call me and tell him how alone he felt, how he needed me. He even said that me being there for him when he was sick made him feel bad when he wasn't there for me.

I've known my friend for about a year now, and the beginning of our friendship was great - we hung out a lot, talked everyday on skype, and just generally had a great time being close friends.


But the past 2-3 months he changed, a lot. I was busy with uni life so we weren't talking as much but still met up at school regularly. At the beginning he just ignored me, but then he started posting walls of skype messages and then deleting them. This happened about 4 times. He always asks who i'm talking to. We don't talk for days straight. When I confronted him about the deleted messages he told me to 'go talk to your thousand other friends' since he's 'replaceable', and later he told me it's because he never had close friendships like we did since he kept people at arms length. He then went on a rant about how I never talk to him, my responses were lacking/i'm boring,  how he's ignoring me to get used to me not talking to him everyday, how he wished we could go back how we used to be, how he got too close to him, and how he regrets that. 


He repeated this rant to me at least 3 times over the past 2 months, and each time I tell him that he's one of my closest friends, how much I treasure him and that we could go back talking regularly but he's just not continuing the conversation. He's been skipping classes (uni) and his grades dropped, and his health is affected too. 


2 days ago, he told me he was sick of my 'bullshit', he hasn't smiled/laughed in the past few months, and that i'm half the reason for his depression (i'm assuming the other half is his family issues, but I don't know anything about them). He also said that in his mind he lost me as a friend already, and he's a loser, and his only friend (me) is someone he doesn't want to talk to. He also added that we can't go back how we used to be because he changed even if I didn't. I just don't know how to respond to them. Right after this though, we got along pretty well and had a good casual chat which we didn't have in a while.

He‚Äôs in town helping his ill mother and while meeting up for drinks he asks me how I‚Äôd feel about lending him some money (about a grand). 

I don‚Äôt consider that this would be a ""loan"" as much as a gift and I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs okay to ask what it‚Äôs for. 

The guy does contract work here and there, but is currently unemployed, has a fairly significant gambling problem, etc. He promised that he‚Äôd be able to pay it back and was willing to draw up a contract, I said give me some time to think about it, made some joke about sexual favors and changed the subject. 

I guess, I‚Äôm wondering if you all have a general opinions on loaning money to friends. The amount isn't really significant, but I certainly wouldn't want to just throw it away. I've generally avoided lending money to friends in the past. Will not lending money be as detrimental as lending it and not being paid back?

85826,Non-Romantic,3ignu6,"**Background** : I've worked at a small local gym for close to six months now. I originally applied there to teach an aerobics class. I got the job, but also asked if I could help out at the front desk. At the time, I was looking for somewhere to work over the summer, so I said yes. 

I felt as though I was put in bad position from the start as far as my class goes. I was given the latest time slot at a time when we do not offer nursery services for people who have children. My class was not advertised, and new students told me all the time that they had no idea there was even a class at that time. Front desk also became a mess. I was constantly asked to take up other people's shifts and ended up getting guilted into taking most of the weekend shifts. I have just started a really intense master's program and now have work/class/internships from literally 7:30 in the morning to 8:00 at night. Weekend shifts mean no days off to catch up on schoolwork or do anything else, ever.

**Now** : I got a text from the boss who is over the aerobics schedule (Josie) yesterday saying that she's replacing my class with another one. She gave me literally a week's notice. I turned down a job teaching this same aerobics class at my college and could have taken it had I known in advance that the plan was to switch out my class for another. I texted back and asked for another time slot if this is the case, Josie said fine and asked me to give my schedule to the boss who is over the specific gym I work at (Jimmy).

I drive straight there, give my schedule to Jimmy, who blames everything on Josie and claims that she's trying to get in good with this girl who is teaching the other class.  He suggests that I move my class to Friday.

I call Josie and she says I can try Friday... but gives me the exact time that high school football starts. She also says that if I want to keep the class, I have to consistently have at least 20 people in the class, adding that I can still work at the front desk. We're a small gym and I'm not even sure that 20 people can comfortably fit in our aerobics room. We're also dead during Friday Night Football. I feel as though I'm being set up to fail. The kicker to all of this is she said that Jimmy knew that she was planning on switching out my class and was supposed to talk to me and work this out ages ago.

I've reached a point with this place that I'm thinking it's better for my mental health to quit and let them deal with all the shifts that I've signed up for this month, but the thought of not teaching aerobics bums me out, as I've put a lot of work into this class.

**UPDATE**: Jimmy just texted me, saying he's got my back and that he's going to advertise my new class. But if I'm to believe Josie, he's the one that claimed my class was not doing well and could be replaced from the start. I don't know who or what to believe.
   
**tl;dr**: I've poured all of my free time into a gym that screwed me over and took my aerobics class from me - both bosses blame each other.

163707,Dating,2bk0st,"I work in a corporation as a consultant (for 2 years) and recently my department got a new vice president. The previous vice president got fired for sexual harassment with his assistant (she left the company because of him), so the new vice president was working for a couple of months without an assistant. Eventually the new vice president finds an assistant (short latina american girl) and she is somewhere around my age. I'm introduced to her since I am very much the go to person for computer problems, even though I am an not an admin, I was doing administrative work as well. Essentially I am told that she will take over most if not all of the administrative work that I do on a day to day basis - which is something that I wanted for a long time. 

Getting to know her for a couple of weeks, training her on things, got her number for quick communication and going out for several lunches, she eventually starts pressing for personal details from me. Things about what I do outside of work, if I'm currently dating anyone, and of course if I want to hang outside of work. I left my last relationship in the end of 2012 so I was certainly on the market to look for someone new and start talking to other girls. In exchange, I ask her about her relationship past too. She says that she got out of a long relationship 5 yr + a few months ago and that she would still take him back if he changed the way he behaved (so I think to myself that she's probably not on the market). 

A couple days later, she asks if I'd like to come out to her birthday party, she's going to a bar with her friends and she'd like me and another co-worker to attend. The other co-worker bailed out, so I went alone and met all of her friends. We all went to the bar, had a good time, laughed, joked and drank alot. At this point the bar was closing so she and her friends were about to head home. She gave me a kiss on the cheek goodnight and I really didn't expect it, so I gave her one back and said thanks for the good night. 

Come to work the next Monday and we act pretty normal. I still think nothing of it because I'm not sure what she wants to do with this, so I'm thinking that we're just on a friendly status. That Friday she asked if I wanted to leave work early with her and grab a drink. I really couldn't do that since I had so much work to do so I said I had to pass. She understood and told me that if I wanted to hang out this weekend that I should text her (we live a few blocks away from each other). I said for sure.

I ended up texting her that weekend and she said that she was having brunch with her siblings during that time, but I was invited to go - I passed on it and rescheduled for that Monday. She said yes. End of monday we go grab drinks and have a great time, laughing, getting to know her better and had a couple of drinks. She even invited me to come visit her family's home in the DR for a weekend, which I was totally onboard with. Once we're done drinking, we end up making out, outside of the bar and she eventually invites me back to her place. Here I'm thinking to my self, it's game time.

Unfortunately she had family issues going on at home and the drunk part of her caused her to have an argument with her step mom. I was in the middle of this crossfire for a good thirty minutes. The argument ended with my coworker threatening to kick her step mom out of the house since the actual home was owned by her biological mother. Since she couldn't stand staying at home, she was pretty upset at this point and told me that she was going to grab a couple pieces of clothes for the week and not return home. I asked where she was going to go sleep and she said her friends place. So she grabbed some clothes and we went to a bar and drank some more, then she went to her friends place. Before we parted from each other, she gave me another kiss on the cheek and told me she had a fun night, and to text me when I get home. 

The next day at work, she acted completely normal, back on friendly status again I assumed. She didn't want to talk about the issues that went on at home so I never asked about them (although I was concerned). Since I enjoyed hanging out with her that night, I think to myself that I will try to set up another date to hang out with her. As the work week went by, I could tell she was bothered by something. She wasn't acting warm towards me, like she was previously. We usually go out for lunch everyday, but each day she kept saying that she simply wasn't interested, or wasn't hungry. Or when we did grab food, she would just go to her desk to eat rather than eat in the cafe with me. I try not to jump to any conclusions, and my best guess was that she's simply going through some shit and needs her space. 

The next week begins and it's monday. She acts a little normal again and at the end of the day she waits at my desk so that we can leave the building together. She asks what I'm doing after work and I told her that I was going to meet a friend for dinner. She said that she was going to eat with her sister and that I was invited to come. I really wanted to, but I couldn't bail on my friend, so I said next time. I was like lets grab drinks some other time, and she said that Friday would work. As the week went on, she wasn't as affectionate as before and started acting a little mean towards me. She would have something to say about everything that I said. She would snap at small things that normally would come off as a joke to others. She would constantly act busy when we work on projects together (pretending to text on the phone). She would make random comments that she's busy the next coming weekends and she has so many plans. She would even mention several times throughout different days about going back home and pretending that she never invited me (and I don't really want to say ""what about me?"" because I didn't want to come off as clingy).  Come that Friday, I was about to leave early. She ended up making me stay because she lied to me that we had to work on a project for the vice president, that was due right before the up coming Monday. So I'm sitting there waiting for her to tell me what it is, she ends up making me wait until 6pm - where she then tells me it was a joke and there's nothing to do. we end leaving the building together, but she didn't bring up anything about the drinks plan that we originally scheduled. I assumed that she just wanted to go home. Because that's what she said she was going to do after work. She mentioned that she had nothing to do this weekend after I told her I had no plans. I was about to suggest that we do something this weekend, but I was feeling a little less confident since she ignored the Friday plans (even though I didn't even bother to confirm the day of.) 

At this point, it's wednesday, the past two days have been the same and she's hanging around my desk alot, talking to me for a bit, saying hi, making me do tasks which require me coming to her desk alot. But the attitude that she has towards me and my jokes come off mean. i get the idea that she doesn't like me or doesn't want to hang out with me. But it's often conflicted with the previous ways that she acted towards me, which was more affectionate. 

At this point I don't know what to do. I don't know if I should ask her out to hang again. Or if I should just avoid this because she's my co-worker. I don't even know if this negative attitude is a way for her to say that she likes me but she's not seeing any affection from me. I don't text her after work, since I get the feeling that she texts so many other people, she gets so many likes on instagram, that I'm probably not on her radar. 

Am I just overthinking **all** of this? 
 
Few things to add: she skips meals and is anemic

133734,Relationships,245t60,"We were friends for ages, years.

The last few months of us being friends I became really unhappy, she was going through a hard time and leaning on me, like she would constantly want to hang around me and I felt like I couldn't have other friends. I told her she wasn't normal, and it's not normal to just have one friend, non stop. She would always borrow my clothes, I let her drive my car and stay over and lend her money because she was going through that hard time but it just got to much, so I asked her to leave and she got upset. 

She moved into her own place and let me live with her for a bit but I kept leaving to go home, I just needed space away from her. Then I just moved home. She kept getting emotional.

I took a holiday and I don't know what happened, she was going out with our group so I just blocked her one day and cut her off. She started calling and calling and I just didn't answer, I sent her a message saying I was done but she kept calling asking why? I don't know why she couldn't just leave me alone.

I got back and didn't tell her and then the group cut her off too. I don't know why they did? That's when she came to my house a few months later crying and said sorry and tried to fix things but I told her I don't want anything? Am I right or wrong here? 
I told her she must have abandonment issues or something because people move on and people change.
