Our social lives basically started around the same time our relationship started, she was 15 and I was 16, and we basically learned how to deal with everything that life threw at us together.

We've been through our teenage years together, and also through many troublesome family issues in between. We both consider ourselves better people because of each other, our conversations are usually extremely productive and we sorted many issues, being it family or immaturity like this, communication has always been great.

There is one problem though, I always felt like I had something to learn from her, as she is very outspoken and can express her feelings very well, whilst I am more introverted and usually take quite some time to get my point across. This resulted in me not having many problems with going with what she says, because logically it always made a lot of sense.

One of those things that I basically accepted as being true is that (friendly) relationships with people of the opposing sex is something that usually doesn't work out, because more likely than not, your friend will be romantically interested in you.

This isn't an issue for me, because I'm pretty uninterested in any other female, and don't even feel like having friends of the opposite sex. You could also tell me that I ""don't know better"" because I'm usually at environments where the majority of people are male.

Anyway, another perspective to take in mind is that her social circles weren't very broad until very recently (her previous ""friends"" were pretty much bitches), she usually was very clingy to me, because I haven't had any major issues with friendships, but deep down she always was a ""social butterfly"". 

Recently she found a job and has felt more independent, as if she was for the first time standing on her own feet (flashback to the ""family and social circle issues"" I talked about briefly). She has been more confident in herself and consequently being able to put herself out there more easily, which I think is great, it seems like we're both adding to the relationship.

All of these things I said bring me to my main point: With her newfound confidence, she has expressed the interest in befriending more people, including people of the opposed sex, but she feels like she's doing something wrong when talking to guy-friends because she'll worry about what I'll think. It's as if this ""belief"" that we both had for so long that talking to a person of the opposite sex and having a meaningful friendship with them is WRONG is holding her back right now.

Now reddit, I won't lie, I have felt like this before too. I have had the opportunity of making female-friends but avoided it completely because I cared way too much about what my SO would feel. I basically shut myself down (and felt pretty shitty doing it). And also, every time I saw her talking to someone of the opposite sex, I couldn't help myself but to cringe a little. After all, I basically had printed into my mind that it was ""wrong"", and I didn't approach this issue in the best way possible. I usually behaved defensively when this was the subject, and this resulted in some friction between us.

What took me greatly by surprise though, is that recently she expressed the intention of breaking up with me, saying that we are both too ""stuck"" in these ways and are holding ourselves back from having relationships with other people. As much as I agreed with her that it was an issue, I was most definetely not okay with breaking up our relationship because of this, and after a long talk, we agreed to stay together and sort this out (like we did with many other things before).

The problem now is that I feel confident that I can overcome silly jealousy if I really try to, but I'm not so sure the same goes for her if I ever do relate to female-friends. I'm feeling slightly insecure about her reasons to want to break up over something so seemingly solvable, and if her independence is unfortunately making her grow apart from me.

I will talk to her about this issue eventually, but I don't want to wear ourselves out emotionally by hammering the same subject onto her everytime we get a chance to talk. I need a second input, a different perspective -- And also, sorry about the huge story, but I felt like i needed to fill you in on some important details to give you a notion of ""where we are"".

**TL;DR: After four years practically giving only each other attention, we are looking to not feel ""held back"" by the other when relating to people of the opposed sex, which resulted in some (quickly escalated) friction.**

125530,Relationships,31dchy,"We started dating January 28, 2012 and over the course of three years we've gradually pushed away from one another.

Both of us are trying to get our lives together and she seems to be fairing out a little better than myself. I've changed degrees three times in three years because I can't find my path in life.

My family and girlfriend never get along and without exaggerating; they hate each other. I'm caught in the middle and constantly expected to make a choice between both sides. Normally the decision would be family for most young couples, however I have a terrible relationship with my parents that runs deep and is irrelevant to the matter at hand. The point is, my family hates her because they feel like she is toxic to me but my parents and relatives are just as bad or worse than they make her out to be but that's for another day.

I've taken many career aptitude tests and other things. The most recent one, out of the 10 suggestions provided; 6 of them were based around psychology (psychologist, guidance counselor, mental health psychiatrist, etc.). Truthfully I found it ironic because I can't help myself let alone anybody else since I've battled depression and anxiety for many years. I brought this to her attention one day and before I could even state that I thought that it was ironic she piped up and said ""You? You're too screwed up mentally to help yourself let alone anybody else.""

She makes statements like this frequently. I can never seem to say more than a handful of words before she's down my throat about something or she's seemingly upset for no reason. I feel as though she hates my guts. I just try to be as helpful as humanly possible and I support her throughout all of her endeavors but none of that seems to get reciprocated.

I've decided to put my foot down and basically said that she has no right to determine my path for me, nor does she have the right to speak to me, and treat me in a manner as though I'm worthless. Her response was ""make something out of yourself and maybe I will.""

This has been dragging on for quite some time and part of me feels like the best thing for me to do is to break it off with her and reinvent myself. At the same time, with such great investment into this relationship and how I truly feel for the sweet-hearted girl that I know she is makes it seem impossible to leave her.

It happened this Monday, honestly out of nowhere. He was acting weird so I knew something was up. Finally after about a day of acting weird, he sat me down and just broke down. He kept saying that he didn't know how to say it, but that he just needed time with himself because he hasn't really had that since high school.

He wants to be with me, just not now because he can't give me his 100%. Which I understand and appreciate. He really hasn't been single in about 3 years between his last girlfriend and then me.

My girlfriend and I have been riddled with fights with our time together. We do fight alot but we always make up the day after. My GF and I are our first and we know that we're not really sure how relationship works but we know that there would always be fights. 

We do things together and we enjoy them. We enjoy each other's company and we love each other very much. I do what I can for her and she does the same. I bring her a jacket for her class and I carry her books for her when I can. I try to be a good man when I'm with her.

However, it seems that everything I do for her would always be criticized. For example, during our pregnancy scare, I asked other people's opinion (people who are more experienced than us) because we were so worried and I didn't want her to worry. When she found out, she got really mad and got really jealous of my friends. Next, she criticized how I was masturbating and was also jealous of me fapping to pornstars (wtf.). Now, I followed her advice and apparently I did that wrong too. It's like I don't do things for her.

I've supported him through everything.  From losing his license, to getting laid off at work, to finding out his brother is an addict, to dealing with a crazy ex, and more.

His reasons are he is frustrated by my poor stress management and also he has just decided that he doesn't want a long term relationship anymore. 

I have anxiety, it's something I've had my whole life.  I went to therapy for it years ago and also last year again and I admitted that lately I have dropped the ball with it.  I have been talking to my doctor recently about exploring some new options, maybe considering medication.  His situations don't help with my anxiety or overall stress but other than that the relationship has been awesome. We have a lot of fun together and we share a lot of the same views about life and where we want to go in the future.  We have so much in common and our personalities go together great.  He has been a great boyfriend up until the last couple of months.  When I brought it up to him that things are getting a little one sided that's when he told me he wants out.

Last week he did have a pretty big falling out with his best friend over some stressful stuff (friendship ending type stuff) and on top of that he said he has been under a lot of stress at work.  I'm wondering if this sudden decision is just him poorly handling stress and trying to shut down and not deal with our situation instead of resolve it.

I managed to get him to think about reconsidering this week and we would talk again on Friday.  Obviously I am hoping he chooses to try to work things out but honestly I think I am going to get broken up with a second time.

**tl;dr**: I'm a runner, currently in marathontraining and vegan. My weight is on the lower end of the BMI, but healthy (18.5-19.5), my roommate won't stop talking about my eating habits and tries to force me to gain weight. Also tries to make me believe I have an eating disorder.

I'm writing this post, because I was (once again) skinny-shamed yesterday. I'm at my wits end and feel judged whatever I do. Before I start: both my orthopedist and GP see nothing wrong with my weight or my eating habits.

My roommate doesn't know a lot about nutrition, but thinks she does. She eats healthy-ish about 50% of her meals, the rest is junk food - a lot of frozen pizza and takeout chinese, high fat cheese and cream over vegetables. She's - I'd guess - about 10-15 lbs overweight. I cook *every* meal at home and eat vegan; also, I don't eat bread and hardly ever pasta (only when I'm carb loading before long runs). I get enough calories, but constantly keep a low-ish weight, because running gets harder if I even weigh 7-8 pounds more. Also, I'm currently in marathon training, which means I run. A LOT.

To my roommate, this opens me up to unwanted criticism all the time. She hardly ever works out, but gives me advice - stuff like you're gonna end up in a wheelchair in a few years and says that I'm destroying my health. Which is, as confirmed by my doctor, bullshit. The annoying part is: I was injured at the beginning of this year, so she sees this as proof for my unhealthy lifestyle.

It's not just the comments about my food, though. She likes to say that certain people are anorexic (sometimes she shows me pictures of skinny girls on facebook and says things like she surely has an eating disorder and when I try to say that she's just fit or it's just the photo and the angle, she doesn't acknowledge it) and constantly tells my I'm too thin and that I have no boobs left (I lost about 6 pounds during the last months, since I've been cutting some weight pre-race). She also tries to define what a healthy weight for me is: I'm 1.71m (5'7'') and weigh around 56.5 kilograms (124 lbs), she tries to tell me that I should AT LEAST weigh 62 kilograms (136 lbs).

This puts in me in a position of constantly having to excuse me for my weight. I like my body the way it is, I like being thin - but I can't say it out loud. But it's not just looks: Have you ever tried running with a 12-pound-plate? It MAKES a difference, especially since my knee is rather prone to injuries.

When I was sick, she randomly made food for me - pasta (which I don't eat unless it's a few days before a long run) and vegetables with LOADS of cream. Then, she got pissed, because I didn't eat it. I didn't even ask her to make it for me.

I track calories, because I like to be aware of what I eat - also, it helps me keep my weight. To her, this is a sign of an eating disorder, to me it is just my way of planning my meals (which I have to, because on some days, I have to load up on calories/carbs, on others, I eat less. depends on my level of physical activity).

We were out for the movies with some friends of ours yesterday. I only had a 5k run that day and already eaten about 1500 calories, then I bought a bar of chocolate at the supermarket and ate it in the cinema (2100 calories) AND we had two cocktails each afterwards (2500 calories, at least). On a day with - except for the running - hardly any physical activity. I got tired at around 12 p.m. and I hardly ever drink, so I wanted to go home. She stayed, got pissed and before I left, she exclaimed - for everyone to hear - WELL IT'S BECAUSE YOU DON'T EAT ENOUGH. I had A WHOLE BAR OF CHOCOLATE in the cinema and she tried to make me buy two instead of one. I don't even like chocolate, I just felt pressured into buying snacks (I'd much rather eaten a healthy meal at home after the cinema) to not be viewed as the anorexic.

I don't get it. I'm at my wits end. She's still asleep and I really feel like running before heading off to uni, but I know that she'll judge me if she wakes up and I'm out for a run. I'm not even underweight or anything. 

Also, she's very know-it-all when it comes to medicine and health, because her mother is a nurse and her aunt is a doctor, so she likes to make comments about other people's health choices (she smokes, btw).

It's hard to confront her about her behavior, because then, she just gets mad, so I keep quiet. What should I do?

She is a sweet girl, a little shy and reserved, but can be outgoing in the right situations. Yesterday I was hanging out in her room while she took a shower and I decided to watch TV. She's an orderly person so she keeps it in the drawer of her nightstand. When I opened it, I saw a black book in there. I thought it was her drawing journal, since she loves to draw, but when I opened it, I realized it was her diary, starting back to three months before we started dating.

She has written in it a lot, nearly five or six updates per week and there are extra lose sheets of her thoughts in there. However, she began mentioning this boy named Garret starting in her entries November 26th, 2013. I was really confused. She talked about ""how stunningly handsome he is"" and how she is ""jealous he has a girlfriend."" Se went to talk about a time they hung out during the weekend. The very weekend she told me she was visiting her grandma a few hours away. She said she ""enjoyed Garret's full nice lips"" and said it was a ""nice change from [my] cold chapped lips."" I was pretty hurt.

Her most recent entry from Monday talks about how she hopes to break up with me at this carnival we are going to on Saturday. And ""after I do that, Garret is going to meet me at the Ferris wheel"". But on a lose sheet of paper dated Tueday, she wrote about how she could not believe she could be so rude. She wasn't sure she could break my heart because I was so sweet, but she couldn't put the fire out on her dying affection for Garret's sturdy person.

First off, I KNOW I shouldn't have read it, but now I'm not sure what to do. Do I break up with her first for mutual differences or tell her I know about Garret? Confess to reading the diary? She hasn't even been acting at different since this Garret guy has come into her life.

A little background info: my SO and I have been together for about 10 months, it is going ridiculously well, and it is the best relationship I've ever been in, ever. We get along well, we work together (we met through work and were friends for about a year before dating), and we've been able to weather a lot of each other's personal issues with very little drama. We're both very understanding and supportive of each other, and I think that this relationship will last for a long, long time.


Anyways, a few years back, right after graduating college, I was living with a different SO, and I was very depressed (though I did not realize I was depressed at the time, or the extent of it). He suggested marriage, and I said yes solely on the fact that I did not have a reason to say no. Basically, I said yes because I was depressed and thought it would help (it didn't, at all). We secretly got married, no one attended, and I only told my best friends. My parents don't even know. Then, after being married for a few months, he ""proposed"" with a ring, and we told everyone about that, including parents. 


Everything about it felt wrong. We moved about an hour away from my friends and family, and knew no one in the new city. I commuted back near my home town, which was an hour commute each way, and he commuted about the same distance in the other direction, back near his hometown. The stress of the long commutes, feelings of isolation, and poor communication with my husband just made everything worse, and one day I just left. I'm not proud of it, and I wish I could go back and end things differently, but ultimately it was the right thing for me to do. In total we were married for about a year, and the divorce was finalized about 1.5 years after we were married.


I never told anyone but my best friends, and a different SO I had in between ex-husband and my current SO. At this point, I don't feel like it ever happened other than on paper. I never felt ""married"", and it was such a short duration, that I don't spend much thought on it anymore. I know I shouldn't keep secrets, but I'm not sure if it's worth bringing up at this point. And I have absolutely no idea how to broach the subject.


EDIT:  I am looking for constructive comments, not judgement. I also want to point out that I did not withhold the information out of a desire to deceive, but rather that being a divorcee is not part of my identity. I treat it as I treat any other breakup, except in this case the government was involved. I also want to point out that I left because I realized we should have never married in the first place, not because it got too hard. At the time I was considering moving into my own apartment. Depression messes with your head, and I did not make a good decision. I was young and made stupid decisions, and have since learned from them.

186404,Relationships,2wqj5d,"Alright Reddit, this is going to be a long one, so stick with me.

I'm 20, and I've always been sort of an odd duck. I've had serious issues with my self esteem and was abused as a child, so I'm always on edge. It's not good, and it leaves me very nervous when I'm in public, I have terrible social anxiety.

My Boyfriend Richard is very calm and collected, he tends to 'see things' and draw evidence and conclusions from them. We weren't together long, but I'm more than sure that I'd like to be with him for a very long time, if not forever. I've never felt this way about anyone before, and he makes me feel like I can do anything. 

The issue starts at the beginning of our relationship, where I was still talking to 2 other people from the dating website that we used to meet. One of them I had planned a date with the night he asked me to be his girlfriend originally (before, not after) and the other that I had wanted to be a friend to, but had mildly flirted with over the course of talking to him. I didn't tell either of them that I had a boyfriend, and I should have. 

Richard saw these when I let him go through my phone (which I fought him about, which probably only made me seem more guilty than I was) and he was devastated. I tried to tell him that it was before we were official, and he wouldn't hear it. I begged him to stay with me, and in the end, he conceded and things continued

Because of this though, Richard had continuously had trust issues with me, which I tried very hard to alleviate. I let him go through my phone when he needed to, and tried to explain conversations that were between me and my coworkers when he asked about them. I always felt that because of our beginning, and because of my behavior in public that he felt that I was trying to hide things.

Finally, his lack of trust got the better of us when I asked my coworkers over(actually because I wanted him to meet my new boyfriend), and Richard took it the wrong way since I hadn't asked him yet and had just assumed we would be together that day. I tried to get him to understand why my coworkers meant as much as they do to me (we're all very tight knit) but it ended when I wouldn't let him go through my internet history.

Reddit, It's been a month and I have tried to move on, but I can't let this end because of something I didn't do- I would never cheat, and am physically incapable of being with another person when I have emotions for someone. I went on a date 2 nights ago, and ended up crying when the person went In to kiss me. I just can't do this anymore- how do I convince Richard that I only want to be with him0 and didn't cheat?

16794,Dating,331n1w,"I recently went out with a guy. The date went pretty well, and we came back to my apartment to watch movies. And we genuinely watched movies until he leaned over to kiss me. We made out a little, but I stopped it before it went too far; I told him that I didn't want to give him the wrong idea because I don't hook up or have one night stands. He said he understood and wasn't expecting to have sex that night anyway. 


I felt bad because I thought that maybe I made him feel like he did something wrong, so I told him that he really didn't do anything wrong, that I liked that he kissed me, but I just didn't want to be a tease. It seemed like this made him feel better, and I asked if he wanted to hang out again and he very quickly said he did. I asked when he was free and he said he was on Friday (yesterday), so we said we'd get in touch again and make plans.

At some point in the conversation, he also told me that he was going to be pretty busy in the next few weeks studying for the GRE and taking over a coworker's accounts at work and visiting friends in another city; he told me that he didn't want me to think that he was blowing me off, but that he had a lot going on.

When he left, he kissed me goodbye. He also texted me immediately after about hanging out again. It seemed like he really did want to see me again... but I never heard from him last night. He had initially said a time that worked for him, and I told him to call me when he was on his way over. I made sure that I was ready by then, and eventually with no text or call I just gave up and went out with friends.


I didn't want to text him because I didn't want to bother him in case he was busy or if he changed his mind. I would have understood if he was busy, but it would have at least been nice of him to give me a heads up. 


I still haven't heard from him at all, should I text him? What should I say? I don't want to bother him because I know he said he was busy; and on the other hand, I also don't want to bother him if he changed his mind about wanting to see me.

45247,Relationships,2ntkpt,"I have been seeing this girl who I absolutely love being around, and she feels the same. We have been hanging out for a month now, and we only got intimate a week ago. I am comfortable with meeting people and maintaining good relations, but I have little to no experience with intimate relationships. 

I am self-aware, confident, and understanding. She acknowledges this and it is what attracts her to me. I am confident this will turn serious, and at this point, I am steering with confidence only based on my knowledge of how general relationships work. I would like to be aware of what to expect and how to lead an intimate relationship with a ~~simple, pretty~~ well mannered, kindhearted, considerate, and a humble girl who takes joy in doing the simplest things.

Based on my knowledge from reading and observing other relationships, thse are some key points that I have established:

A. Communication is key to a successful relationship. No matter what, we will convey our thoughts and feelings. She agrees.

B. I have assured her that unlike her ex I will not pressure her in to anything she is not sexually comfortable with. This makes her feel extremely comfortable with me in general.

C. She is getting over her previous relationship quickly (2 months now) because of how she feels about me. I will be giving her as much time and space she needs to get over it, and I am there to support her.

A few things I would like to hear your thoughts on:

1. We both are quite attached to each other and I find it hard to end our hangouts. I am sure she can feel that I am a bit more attached and loves the attention, but I fear this will make her take it for granted at some point and value it less. I am aware of this fact based on a past experience, but I find it challenging to stop expressing my unconditional affection and desire for her. 

2. I have been initiating most of the meetups. I do not mind that because I like to lead, but I would like her initiate at least 30% of the time if not 50%. She is the kind of girl who would like the guy to lead most of time, but I would like her to take charge as well. Is this something I should convey or accept the way she is?

3. I have a habit of voicing most of my thoughts. To keep the communication going, should I be conveying all my thoughts (confusions, insecurities, doubts, etc.) concerning the relationship or add a boundary/filter somewhere?

4. We both have a fairly high sex drive, but mine is a bit higher than hers. Some times she only wants to cuddle and talk, but all I can think about it is having sexy times once I smell the  fragrance from her hair or skin. It turns me on like a light bulb. In these situations, I find myself seducing her to make out or more. And later I feel disappointed with myself because I am being self-centered and I should have better control. Is this a common problem?


Point by point comments would be helpful and easy to read. Any other general advice is welcome.

188606,Relationships,2aqyt9,"To start off I suppose I should say my current girlfriend is way better than any I've had before. She is my dream girl and I've never felt this way about someone before and for the most part, she feels the same way about myself. We've discussed what our lives would be like together many years from now in extensive detail and we both could see ourselves being together forever.  
  
Anyway, recently I've gotten in contact with an old online friend (she is 19 and f, we'll call her Kate) whom I've never met in person. My girlfriend isn't sure what she should think of me speaking with Kate again but I assure her there are no feelings on either side and that's that.  
    
A few days later after talking, Kate confesses that she has feelings for me despite being in a long term relationship herself, but I made it clear that the feelings were not reciprocal and didn't think much of it. Fast forward a day or two.  
I'm with my girlfriend and somehow Kate comes up in the conversation, and I make some comment about her having feelings for me. My girlfriend gets horribly upset and asks if I had planned on telling her this, to which I admitted, no I hadn't planned on it. I erase Kate from my contacts and assure my girlfriend that I will not contact her again, and that I had no idea she would be this upset.   
  
Now thinking back on it I really should have planned on telling her about Kate's feelings but I thought nothing of it at the time and didn't even think of telling her. After a hard three-four days my girlfriend forgives me for making this mistake and everything is okay again. At least that's what I thought.  
  
It's been about a week now, and earlier in the day my girlfriend spoke to her mother about the issue. Let me start by saying that her mother likes me, and this post has nothing to do with her mother. I guess her mother agreed that what I did was wrong, and that she was right to be upset. This discussion which took place between her and her mother must have reinforced some negative feelings because she went back to being unsure if we would be able to recover from this.  
  
I have no idea what to do. I made a mistake, I've apologized, I've removed Kate from my life entirely, yet somehow this mistake continues to haunt me. I literally feel sick thinking about this entire incident possibly ruining our relationship. Any advice, criticism, or help would be greatly appreciated. I'm desperate at this point.

108764,Non-Romantic,281wql,"So this was a coworker of mine (former) turned friend because we went through pregnancy together. 

Well now we both have 2 yr olds and she doesn't have any other friends. There are reasons for this 

1. She has no social skills. She doesn't understand what is appropriate to say and what is not. Example: ""OH don't worry, just because [her child] is walking before [my child] doesn't mean she'll be any smarter than him!!"" (HA! Don't worry, I figured that out on my own when your child started early intervention because she is so behind) 
**Edit: ** another example comes from her love of thrifting. She will go on monologues to anyone who will listen listing all of her purchases, ""I GOT BOOTS. Michael Kors. $450, I got for 15 cents"" but no one really cares and she goes on forever and it's actually really embarrassing for her but it's like she just doesn't notice. She will list over 50 things she purchased without stopping, even if it's CLEAR everyone is bored of hearing it. She reminds me of my roommate who had very severe asperger's, but I am not a doctor so I don't say anything about that. 

2. She is a ""know it all"" without actually knowing it all, at all. She will go on long diatribes over someone microwaving a baby bottle or using ""cancer causing"" baby powder. It's like she is trying to be some guru for mothers or something but it really just pisses everybody off because no one needs her advice. 

3. It is not just me who thinks this way, she had no friends growing up and was bullied. Every single person at the job we worked together hates her, even our boss. Her neighbors have blocked her on facebook and phone and refuse to speak with her. This is because her kid got eczema and she accused them of putting chemicals all over the lawn which then gave her kid the eczema. (ok...) 

4. She just isn't very fun. She constantly has a sour attitude and makes no effort to hide it from people. 

Now I bet you are all wondering why I am her 'friend' to begin with. It's because I honestly believe she just has horrible social skills and doesn't mean to be malicious. We *can* have fun together, it's just I never know what I'm going to get, you know? I might want to scratch my eyes out the whole time or it might be kind of fun. 

My problem is that I am her only friend and she is constantly trying to make plans. If I am busy she will just rewrite the plans 100 times to make them fit my schedule. If I see her and say I can grab coffee then I have to go, she will invite herself over to my house after. I am not a pushover and I do take a stand and say ""no, sorry, I'm busy."" But I'm dreading when my phone rings. It's pages of texts of ""well i'll just come over at X time and we can do X Y Z !!""  

I am an intovert. I am the most introverted person I know. But I am not shy, I am friendly, social, and outgoing so people don't understand how that could be. I love being alone. I am alone right now and reveling in it. She is suffocating me and the only way I know how to get away is to cut off the friendship all together. 

What can I say to this girl to get her to make some real friends? Can I tell her that she has no social skills and this is why everyone hates her? She knows people avoid her and don't want to be her friend, she just doesn't know why. I think her husband won't tell her because he fears her wrath (insane mood swings, breaking things, screaming at the top of her lungs at her daughter)....I'm at my wits end and I DO care for this girl a lot and I want her to have a happy life. But I can't give her that life

There was a time, last September, where we were just constantly fighting (I wasn't checking in with her enough, I was bad at giving affection), that we split up for about 4 months.



Now look, whatever happened in those 4 months is not my business.  However, when she asked me to move back in, there were other guys clothes there, a box of condoms in plain sight, and other blatant reminders that she had a guy over.  That stung a little but it was to be expected and I chalked it up as her having forgotten to clean it up.  These items stay around the house for a good month before I ask her to please pick then up because they're hard to look at. 

 At first she seemed a bit irritated so I brought up my secret weapon and told her, ""put yourself in my shoes.  When you come over to my place do you want to see reminders of the girls I may have seen during those 4 months?  And when you would ask me to get rid of it, that I would become annoyed?""


That fixes things right up....at least I thought.


During New Years, her phone is getting blown up with texts and she's hiding them from me, pretty actively.  I didn't snoop, but I did start adding people she knows to my fb.  I laid the trap and waited.  

One day while we were at work, she texted me in a panic and wanted to know WHY I HAD ADDED MITCHELL(name changed to protect the douchebag).  I told her I wanted to be more friend with her friends this time around so I would know who they were when you took me to see them.  Something was off, though.  She kept asking me things like ""are you sure that's why you added him?"".  I maintained my truth.


When we got home that night, I waited until she went to bed and pulled up her fb messenger.  Something in my gut told me something was not right.  Sure as hell.  What do I see?  Him sending very graphic fb messages.  I see her giving half hearted replies encouraging him to keep going.  This basically went on until the night before.  I was shocked, I was pissed, I wanted to just let out a guttural roar. 


I didn't though.  My father always taught me that showing anger through intense sounds, expressions or violence meant that you already lost.



So I sat the gf down the next night and I asked her why friending that guy was such a big deal.  She blew it off as him thinking it was weird and that was all.  Then I asked her if they ever text or fb message each other.  Her claim was that she hadn't texted him in months (lie #1), that she NEVER uses facebook messenger, like NEVER. (Lie #2).  



I told her, ok, them let's look at your chats and fb messages with this guy only.  I don't want to see anything else, but you need to get my trust on this because even you know it's looking shady.  She relents.  She sees all the iMessage correspondance they have had to get her contradicting my lie.  I went message by message asking her if that would feel good to read if you were in my shoes.  I really wanted her to back up from the situation and get a subjective view of those texts.  None of which included any word from GF that she had a bf.  That part was completely left out.



She apologized when she could see how that would make a person feel and that I was right.  She's in a relationship and she doesn't want to be seeing that shit anymore,

She went back to her normal self, now not sending duty texts to guys who are 120 miles away.  However, while she was asleep one night, her phone started buzzing and buzzing hardcore.

It's basically him rolling his tshirt up his abs with his teeth and at the same time tugging the front pants down a little bit for a peak.  I'm pissed.


I'm in kid if a quandary here.  She has sparsely been replying to this guy via Facebook and has moved to snapchat.  Unfortunately a few minutes ago, I checked her snapchat and this guy has been sending himself more pictures (while we were eating at a nice dinner I took her to).

A lot of people would describe me as a loud, crazy person, while others think I'm shy and quiet. I'm artistic although its not a skill I particularly like because its all I know and it gets boring. Anyway a bit about me, I'm about 5 feet tall, very petite weighing 7 stone (98 lbs) and I'm black but a lot of people mistake me as mixed or hispanic, chinese or something crazy because I'm light skinned.. I also have a baby face ;-; getting tired of getting asked if I'm a freshman (highschool). I know I'm young and I still have many years ahead of me but I can't help but to get into relationships. My parents are so strict, to the point where I can't go out.(never been to the beach..) I can't do anything until I reach a certain age.  But when the time comes I know I'll appreciate every moment of my freedom.(Due to the restrictions of my parents, in the past it caused me to be depressed and such but since, I feel hopeful to see close friends again.)


So from what you've read, you can see that from my situation that it makes relationships difficult for me to keep, since I'd have to keep my parents from knowing about it. So far, I've been in 2 relationships. The first was recent and it lasted 2 years.  This second guy I met was when a couple of friends introduced me to pot. While I was high I asked Danny if liked me and he said yes. I wanted to keep it as friends cause after the break up from before with Jay, I was finally getting used to being single and happy. I pushed him away and I told him he shouldn't love me but he stuck to my side anyway. He was obsessed with me and I liked the attention. We got along very well. Danny  told me he loved and cared about me a lot and he'd wait for me as long as it takes. He REALLY wanted to be my boyfriend. He also knows my ex and he wanted to help me get over him and all the bad things I've gone through. He talked about me a lot and I thought I should give him a chance, so on the 7th I said we're officially together. We had a very playful, rough relationship which I enjoyed. He had a laid back personality and wasn't the jealous type. (unlike my ex;my ex, Jay was so insecure he never let me talk to his friends) 


I thought it was perfect and I slowly started trusting him and started falling in love with him. That's when everything changed. On the 21st he stopped talking to me as much as we used to.  He started ignoring me completely, he wouldn't hug me, talk to me or even acknowledge my existence. I confronted him about it and he said I told you, we're on a break, I'm not ignoring you. yet he wouldn't make eye contact with me. I tried talking to him but, nothing. I kept wondering if I did something wrong. In the weekend I messaged him good morning and he replied with. Hmh and I just said I understand if he doesn't want to speak and he just replies with K. So yesterday my friend Paul messaged him and I was brought up. Danny said She's a good person but I just wasn't feeling it no more. I'm not right for her. Paul sent me the screenshot. The moment I saw that is when it started making sense. He told someone he broke up with me but when I asked he said he never said that and said we were just on a break. So, I message him a few hours later and long story short he said he lost his feelings for me. My heart was beyond broken. I hadn't eaten right the past few days since he started ignoring me. I'm emotionally exhausted, and I wish we'd just had stayed friends. The moment I fell in love is when he decided to end it. That's why I feel like I can't trust anyone anymore. I can't handle the pain that comes with heartbreak. Anyway, its hard cause I want to get over it but we have the same circle of friends. And I also saw him with a girl today, playing so, I guess that's the reason. He moved on. I just feel like every time I feel something for someone it just never works out for me and I'm afraid of getting hurt. I felt better off single but the two people I were in relationships with were okay with it only being in school.


Sorry for the long blocks of text, but if you'd like to know additional details please let me know. 


 Tl;dr: I've only have had two relationships and this recent one tore my heart out more than the one that lasted 2 years because it was perfectly fine until I started falling in love with him. He knew my ex and he promised he'd help me get over him and does the opposite of what he said he would do.  I wasn't expecting to fall in love or for anyone to love me like he did at that time for that matter. He ignores me completely and makes me feel like I don't exist. I didn't expect for a relationship to form  between us but I did so because I felt confident and trusted his words. He lost his feelings for me. I saw him with a girl today so he must have moved on.

So I have been having a few doubts recently about whether I want to continue pursuing a relationship with my girlfriend of a year and a half. She is next to perfect in pretty much every way and the fault is not even a little bit with her.

Some background, two years ago at college one of my best friends, who we shall call Andrew, developed a crush on a girl in his class and, over the course of the summer, they became close. he never worked up the courage to ask her out, but I have it on solid authority that if he had she would have said yes. Flash forward to last year and he brings her into our already extensive friendship group, where she proceeds to develop an intense crush on me. I'm talking 'even looking at her made her blush' levels.

A few months in, she starts talking to me on facebook, and a few weeks after this we begin dating in secret. Andrew finds out when we tell him a month later, and utterly takes it like a champ. I mean it, we are both best mates still. 

Me and her proceed to have the best time ever for a year, with me helping bring her a little out of her shell and stop her self-harming and self-confidence issues. At the start of that year she was rejected from all of her university applications, and so has stayed home and got a part-time job. 

In the last few months, my workload from college and actual work has massively increased, and I don't feel like I'm putting in enough time with her anymore. we only spend a few hours together every two nights or so. She is also still talking to Andrew, who is at uni, every night. I'm a little troubled by this because he totally wanted her and may well still, but aside from me he is the only friend she has.

So, now we come to the meat of the issue. I'm not happy any more. I focus a lot on my work and she often gets pushed to the sidelines when something difficult comes up, and she doesn't seem to fully understand why. I know I'm hurting her to focus so much on work, but there is nothing I can do about it. So I'm not happy when I'm not with her, and I'm not really particularly happy when I'm with her either. I just can't help but notice that she puts so much more into this relationship than I do, because she has literally nothing that she ever needs to do past 6'o'clock. She goes to work, she comes home and that is the end of her day, essentially. We also share literally no interests whatsoever and since I am unhappy almost constantly, I feel like I am a constant drain on her, and she doesn't deserve that.

We both got accepted to the same university, but I find it hard believing for a second that she will actually go. I find it hard to really believe in the long-term viability of us and I feel like I'm just stringing her along.

When I think of reasons to stay with her, I can only think of how much it will hurt her if I do leave, and how Andrew will react. He is one of my best friends, and I know he would only invite on of us over to any events he holds while back down fro the holidays. But I really cannot help but feel like he would choose her over me. so maybe I'm staying with her because it's kinder to her because apparently I am the man of her dreams (I know there are better people out there for her) and kinder to him because he doesn't have to choose between his friends.

Or maybe I'm making it all up internally as an excuse to leave her so I can try to bang other people.

35360,Non-Romantic,2icpw9,"My friend Sara is an amazing friend and I really love her. She hasn't had much luck with relationships in the past and I am so happy that she finally found love. Her boyfriend Mark is a really nice guy. I've known him a while since we have hung out a couple of times but I don't know him that well.

Sara and Mark were best friends before, they met at work and hit it off. About a month and a half ago they finally declared their feelings for each other. I wasn't surprised because the few times we hung out together it was really obvious that she had feelings for him. He seemed to be holding back though and I understood why. He is engaged to a girl back home and is currently in a long distance relationship with her. From what she said last, he is slowly breaking it off with her since the girl is very sensitive and if Sara is to be introduced to his family in the future (they are very serious) it's important that her name not be brought up in all this, even though he is cheating on his fiance.

All of that is his business but I am finding it hard to relax because I know that if this goes south, it is going to crush Sara and I really am not sure how to feel. For now, I support her decisions and am encouraging and happy that she's happy because she deserves it.

The problem is that now that she's in her honeymoon phase she wants to spend all her time with him and that's great! However, like I mentioned, I can't help but feel uncomfortable considering he's still officially engaged, and I would like to spend some time with her one on one so we can talk about everything but she always brings him along.

I did tell her that it'd be nice if we could hang out, just the two of us at least once since I miss her and have things to talk about, she agreed to make it happen. At the last moment the plan changed and once again I was third-wheeling on their date.

Just now I invited her to go out with my sisters and cousin on a girls day out, to the movies, and she said sure! She'll bring Mark along if everyone was cool. It would be cool but my family is a bunch of introverts and though my sisters would be ok with my friend because they know her, they would ask me why I asked Mark along too since none of them know him. It would be easier if they were already well acquainted with each other but we're not. 

I did mention to my friend that my sister may not be that comfortable and tried to suggest that they go on their own preferably at a later hour since because of our schedule we're going stupid early. She said she would let us know - but I feel horrible because I know that she's felt the hesitance in my tone and I really want to hang out with her and her boyfriend too! But I don't know how to stop feeling awkward.

And before you all bash me for being a prude or jealous, I have a girlfriend I'm madly in love with (long distance at the moment) and I have no problem with intimacy. When we all hang out I try my best to have fun with both of them and keep myself busy whenever they start getting all cuddly.

Problem is, I don't like being made a third-wheel, and don't like worrying about her being the other woman. But most importantly, I want to know how can I be a truly supportive friend by pushing my issues aside?

We started talking when i was 16, she said she was 14, so that was fine, we were only friends. Bla bla bla we spoke on and off and eventually she started to like me, but still was with other guys, i didn't care we never even met each other. The past year she has decided i am going to be with her. Now i was like Shes 19 and good looking so yeah sure. WELL i found out she lied to me about her age and she is currently 17. So i refused to be with her at minimum until she was 18. That's acceptable since she still has school and we dont live together. WELL It went from Okay-to-holy-shit-not-okay pretty fast. WAYYYYYYY off the deep end fast. Within a week she started saying she loves me and like pushing me as hard as she could with a threatening tone to make me say it back. I got away with only talking every other day, and we only ever text so about half way through this year we have spoken we had a big fight, and instead of something reasonable for a meaningless fight with no real purpose that she started herself she says If you dont agree with me ill fucking kill myself. I was freaked out and just let go, though she was completely wrong and the situation was her fault. Now again this has become a trend, We fight she threatens to kill herself and this time it got to the point where i found out its all just words. She found out i watch porn once in a while? and absolutely went bat-shit crazy.

Both my boyfriend and I work (me full time, him part time variable hours). His mother doesn't work due to disabilities (though I question whether partly because she just doesn't want to). 

I know money is tight. My boyfriend and I both pay a set amount each month, but apparently things have changed with her benefits recently so she is receiving less money and is owing money she doesn't yet have.

I've been asked (as I have about £500 savings) to borrow her £300 for some bills due now with the promise to pay it back in the the next week or so. 

I'm highly uncomfortable with this. It's not that I don't trust her, but I know something will crop up (more bills etc) and then the payment date will get moved.

125740,Relationships,243for,"I've been with my girlfriend for roughly 8 months now. We started sleeping together, having been friends/acquaintances for a few years through friends. Randomly met up out at a bar one night and we ended out sleeping together. 

We kept sleeping together (not often, maybe 2 or 3 week breaks), and hanging out for 6 months, we started dating officially about 8 months ago and decided to be exclusive, everything was great. Very relaxed, but just more time together and much more intimacy and sharing more stuff in general. I didn't have any issues with jealousy/anxiety or anything like that. 

However, she went on a 2 month trip to Europe by herself (contiki, backpacking, visiting friends), which she had been saving for/planning for a long time. And I was going overseas (skiing/travelling with friends) as well for a month almost as soon as she got back from Europe. Meaning that we wouldn't see each other for nearly 3 months.


I mentioned the idea to her about having a break from the relationship over the period, not wanting to spoil the relationship. Having tried long-distance I really didn't want to cope with the natural anxiety, longing etc that comes with it. She was really upset by the idea, and I didn't want to lose her altogether, so we stayed together.

She and I both return from our trips and start back at university for the year. Everything is great about our relationship, we both are independent and love spending time with each other. So we have a good balance. However, now I get really anxious about close male friends and am struggling to trust her.


Particularly one friend, who she is good friends with, who she works with. They used to regularly watch movies together at his house after a shift. Message fairly regularly, and share similar interests. I never had issue with him or the fact she had a close male friend until after the trips away. I have also never met the guy, I asked to meet him fairly casually cause he seems important to her and I said it's odd that I haven't met him. Knowing that if I had a female friend who I was really close with (I have had in the past, but not atm) I'd want her to meet the friend. 

He is away on a trip at the moment and won't be back for a month or two, so I can't meet him anytime soon. But they are still in regular contact, like once or twice a week they'll Facebook message even though he is overseas. 

Having seen their text conversations (we are pretty regularly texting for each other if the other is driving/busy). She is very normal to him through text but I get the feeling he is genuinely interested in her, not just a friend. Saying stuff like ""I miss you"" and commenting on her appearance a little to regularly for me to be comfortable with.

I mentioned I felt uncomfortable about how they were talking and hanging out a lot. She seemed OK, and understood why and they have started hanging out less etc etc. But after that, one particular time, when she got a message on her phone from him saying ""Still good to catch up on Saturday?"". Later that day, I asked if she wanted to catch-up on Saturday she said she didn't have any plans and that we could hangout for the day. Then I remembered she had plans from seeing the text, and asked her why she hadn't told me she was hanging out with her friend. She said she didn't want to upset me and she was going to blow him off to hang out with me anyway. While, it's reassuring she wanted to hangout with me and blew off her friend to do that, I hated the fact she didn't tell me in the first place. She apologised, and I asked her for more openness about that kind of thing.

I am at the point where I feel that I need to put a boundary in place for my own sanity, and say I am uncomfortable with their friendship, but I don't want to be the controlling boyfriend.

I need help controlling these feelings of jealousy. I'd say I'm a fairly anxious person in general, so I know that I might be getting too worked-up by it. Thoughts reddit?

That is what this is about...and I will try to be brief (without robbing you of any riveting details, because I'd love your well-informed opinion on the matter.)


It has been a little over a year since we broke up. We have kept in contact, and seen each other many times. Throughout all of this I have pictured the day that he tells me he made a huge mistake, and that he wants to be with me again. This is not happening.


A little background: We dated for 4 years. We moved to Chicago together. He said he wanted to marry me, have children with me, and that he could not wait for our future together. I felt so lucky to have someone like him in my life; we were best friends. 


One night he came into the living room and said he didn't want to do it anymore. He needed to focus on work, and he could no longer expend energy on a relationship. 


The combination of confusion, devastation and disbelief was unreal; that feeling in my chest is still tangible. He wanted me to leave our apartment that night, so I did out of respect (and perhaps bewilderment.) Try to imagine that for a minute...I promise you it was out of NOWHERE. One moment I am cozily tucked away in the apartment that I share with my wonderful boyfriend....and the next thing I know, he is asking me if I can go somewhere else because he is done with the relationship. Fuckthewhaaaaaat?!


After staying with friends I moved out of the city about 2 months later, and have been in a pretty legitimate downward spiral for most of the last year. The psychological repercussions of what happened between us will probably haunt me for years. I have gained about 30 pounds and my once-healthy self confidence has been decimated. I tenderly refer to this time of my life as fuck it mode.


About 4 months of NC after the breakup, he contacted me and wanted to get together to talk. Of course I went. I had zero closure, and had a feeling all along that something was going on with HIM to spark such a drastic decision and life change. Sure enough, he explained that his father had become very sick several months before. He obviously had not shared this information with me at the time, nor any of his friends, and this burden sent him into a depression. He was realizing that it had a lot to do with his behavior along with the breakup. I comforted him, told him that I would be there for him as a friend for whatever he needed, and that there were no hard feelings. 


We got together maybe once a week after that, once every other week. Very casual, just drinks and then back to his place for a nice fuck. This has gone on up until now. When we are together, we pick up right where we left off. We laugh and talk, we play terribly on the guitar to one another, and then we have better sex than we did when we were together. 


Still, every time I leave his house I start crying as I walk away down the steps. This is so different from my original musings about our future together. This is not what I ever pictured for myself in terms of a relationship. I love the time that I get to spend with him, but deep down I am starting to feel used. 


I don't think I have ever had a healthy relationship, and now I feel like I am crazy or something...one of those girls who is too stupid to recognize a bad relationship when she is in one. A girl who will continue to get used by men because she is scared that the alternative is being alone. I know he doesn't want to get back together, but I miss him and at this point I will take whatever he wants to give me.


I had my first day with a personal trainer today. I am going to turn this shit around, stop drinking, smoking, and everything else I do to distract myself from dealing with the virtual MINDFUCK this past year has been.

http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/25x5bb/my_girlfriend_24_f_broke_up_with_me_25_m_after/


Since making that post, however, Ive realized a lot of different things. First of all, this was clearly NOT just about those girls. Not only that, but my living situation (with three girls) was not even the straw that broke the camel's back. What helped me realize this was that I kicked those girls out, told my ex and she didn't react super positively. Somehow, I had been blocking out in my memory how aggressive I was during our argument. That scared her and reminded her of bad relationships of her past. THAT was the straw that broke the camel's back. And I don't know how I can ever recover from that. 


After realizing this, and spending a few days no contact, I texted her and told her I wanted to meet up and talk. She told me she wasn't ready and I said that was totally fine, but to let me know when she would be. That night she called me, much to my surprise. We talked for almost two hours and the long story short was that she said it had only been one week and that we weren't ready to give our relationship another shot yet. The fight was still fresh in her mind. However, she said that she wanted to be my friend for the time being- that if I really cared, I would be her friend. She didn't say this in a ""I'll let him down easy"" kind of way, I could tell. She really thinks we can just be friends so soon.


Since then, she has texted me every day, we planned to meet up this weekend, and we talked on the phone two other times.  The first time, she was pretty much acting the same as when we dated. She commented on how she wished she could take care of me (I just had surgery but wasn't in town). She made a comment about us having sex. She even said she loved and missed me. The second time we talked, we were both drunk and she ended up ending the call because she didn't think we should talk unless we were sober (good move on her part). After she hung up, she texted me saying ""I love you and I miss you, but we shouldn't talk unless we are sober."" That text has kinda fucked with my head, obviously. Since that night (Saturday), we have texted every day. However, last night she was clearly more distant, saying she was emotionally spent. I decided to just leave her alone with her thoughts. To me, its clear that there is an internal struggle. However, any action I take to try to push her one way or another will only push her away.


So again, I guess this is half rant, half advice seeking. Do I continue this charade of ""being friends"" until saturday or just not talk to her until then? Or maybe just only say something to her when she initiates it? I already mentioned to her that I am working on my anger issues (and a few other things that I didn't mention in this post), is there any need for me to express my willingness to work on things before we meet?

we both were abroad for study in the same city but different universities, but we are from different countries.


in june... exactly 3months for our relationship, her program finished and she went back to her country, we didnt promise each other to continue our relationship, the situation was so foggy, like we didnt know whats gonna happen.


and then two weeks ago she told me that we shouldnt talk to each other anymore, because it is making her feel bad. so i finish my study papers as soon as i could and i travelled to her country, this happened last week, and i didnt tell her, i made it as a surprise. 


she was shocked and she wanted me to leave as soon as possible, she showed me some things in the city on the first day when i arrive, on the second day we had a very emotional day, in the beggining she said that she dont know what she feels anymore, and after some minutes she told me that she dont feel the same anymore, and that love disappeared, and that i should move on in my life. this broke me up. 


but because im already there in her country she continued to show me around. and then... 4 days after that... on the day of my departure back to my country, we had a very warm moment, we were setting near each other and then suddenly we kissed hard for more than a minute. 


and after this kiss finished we didnt speak about it at all, i went to the airport... and she didnt come with me. and here im back home, confused! i love her, and i dont know what can i do more to just be near her, im sure that if me and her are living in the same city, she would have her feelings back, but as for now... she dont want me near her, she want to focus on her study she said.

185429,Relationships,2hbviz,"Me and my girlfriend has been together for 9 months and lives together. We are very, very happy and life could never have been better... However, her culture and her family's view on our same-sex relationship has now left me with trouble, tears, feelings of guilt and de-motivation.  
Backstory: me, her, my family and her family all live in Denmark (Scandinavia). Denmark is very open-minded for homosexuality etc. however, my girlfriend is born and raised in Lithuania. She and her family moved here in 2012. I know many things about Lithuania as of now, I have come to know about traditions, norms, culture, etc. I am not speaking bad about Lithuania, but the country itself do not have the same openmindedness as Denmark. Which, of course, is fine because all countries are different. I like Lithuania and Lithuanian people (those I have met), but the acceptance towards same-sex relationships is not big.  
We went to school together and we knew each other 1 year before we got in a relationship. I have always had a very good relationship with her family, which consists of 2 parents and her little brother.  
We recently moved in together, where after about a month after the move, my girlfriend decided to tell her parents about us after 9 months. Her brother [14] accepts and loves us. Her parents do not. They do not get it, they don't try to understand it and they are in denial. They said to her that nothing has changed. I think they still love her and they like me. Although, when she told her mother first, she said that she knew, but chose not to believe it. She blames Denmark, herself, everything for making her daughter be with another girl. Last saturday we came to her brother's basketball tournament and it seemed like everything has changed. Even though it hasn't. Her mom, I felt, was looking at me differently. They didn't acknowledge us or anything, but treated us like her and I were still just friends. It was a weird experience, because now we are finally open towards them, we can build a better relationship without secrets, but it felt exactly the same. We both felt that we couldn't be open with them or build something new.  
Now, her father visited us yesterday, but only wanted to talk to my girlfriend in the parking lot. He told her that he was disappointed in her, that it wasn't right. How could we have kids? Who would want a kid through a test-tube? Why did she give into temptations (me)? Stuff like that. He said he had read articles that said homosexual people were selfish, they did it because they didn't want kids, etc.  
Now I am at a loss... During the last 3 months I have been studying Lithuanian language, we were also planning a trip to Lithuania soon. But now I feel totally demotivated. I know we have to give her parents time to accept us, but just the thought about it makes me so sad. I don't know how to accept that her parents can act like this... I do not want to be selfish and say that I am never going to accept where she comes from etc. The thing is, I like her family, I love her language and I want to learn it for her, for our kids one day. I just don't know how to do it with her parents, because I feel they will never accept us. Even if they will one day, I know what they truly think of us and I just can't understand....  
Please, help me to understand. Have any of you been in a similar situation? How did you deal with it? How do I get back on track with studying and planning a trip when I just don't feel the same?  
I just don't know what to do anymore, because I want to be a part of her family and I want to spend holidays etc with them... But how can it all go back to the same?

I thought I saw signs that weren't really there and I told him I loved him as a consequence. He got awkward at first, pretended it never happened and when he finally acknowledged it, he just went back to how things originally were. I was ecstatic at first, but I started slowly reading signs again (which don't exist, I know).

The biggest problem is that our hang outs are always intimate-we talk about things we don't share with others, we go on trips alone (we just went to Brazil) and we recently went kayaking/camping. Nothing overtly sexual happens and I try to keep my distance as much as I possibly can. I avoid drinking with him as much as I can to the point that I find it easier to say that I don't drink for health reasons. I've forbade him from changing in front of me. I honestly don't want to endanger the friendship or help him cheat/explore his sexuality.

I thought I could get over him by meeting his GF, but that didn't work out. After a few friendly arguments, he agreed to finally letting me meet her for a couple of drinks a few months ago, but it was awkward for all of us. He later told me that she knew that I was gay which made me feel even more uncomfortable and vulnerable. It worries me because I feel like his GF finds our friendship strange and I feel like I should react or something. It also worries me that she doesn't know that I'm in love with him.

I've tried dating other guys, but nothing has worked out yet and it never helped. I recognize that I'm using him to fill a relationship gap, but we're starting to see each other even more frequently and it hurts that I still care for him very deeply. 

There's a voice in the back of my mind that says that he's gay, not into me and using me for the emotional intimacy with a guy. I'm sure this is the same voice that convinces me to eat a bucket of chocolate ice cream for no reason, but it's slowly getting louder all the same.

He's also still a virgin and has told me that he's saving himself for marriage, but I know he's not religious as he was seriously contemplating converting/identifies as atheist. I didn't question his reasoning because I believe faith is a personal thing that you don't need to justify. His GF is not religious either according to her profile. I'm not sure if he has done anything with his GF though. It's getting hard for me to be his friend, but our hangouts are satisfying enough that I don't care. I hate myself for ever liking him. How do I get over him WITHOUT distancing myself? Is this a toxic relationship? What can I do to improve my situation without hurting anyone?

82469,Relationships,2bbzeo,"**Background:** We dated in college after knowing each other as friends for 4 months - when I graduated and moved to a new city for my job, he lived at home in a distant state and looked for a job in my city. The only one he could find was at my company in a different division - so now not only do we live together, we work in the same building. Something something eggs in one basket, I didn't think this through. 

He is a great guy - very mathematically and logically intelligent, very culturally cognizant, a lovely mix of well-socialized and nerdy (a.k.a. a geeky unicorn), and fiercely loyal and supportive. He has been my rock through an eating disorder and parental abuse, and has opened me up to punk rock, gourmet cooking, professional gaming, and chiptune music. I'm about to give a laundry list of shit about him that annoys me and I wish I had the room for a positive version so everyone could see that **he's not a gigantic asshole, he just has quirks that I'm not sure I can live with. **

Living with him wouldn't be a huge problem if he wasn't such a social boob - at first I thought it was introversion but now that I live with him, I know it's because he's a slightly egotistical misanthrope. Which leads me to my list of concerns with him:

* **Being socially withdrawn.** As an introvert with an outgoing personality, I understand wanting alone time as well as chill time. But if it were up to BF, we would watch video game streams every single night and maybe change it up with some Chopped. ZERO desire to socialize or accompany me on social outings. When I drag him out, he fixates on his phone games or the closest TV and half-asses any conversation; when I asked him why, he said he never knows what to do with himself and is disinterested in trying to figure it out. 
* **Is hypercritical of everyone, except me**. He saw my friend mack on a girl at a bar? Typical jock trolling for pussy. Indian friend makes a boob joke? I'm not surprised, given his culture. One of our friends gets too drunk to pay his tab? Fucking mooch. Makes me wonder if I am not actually an exception and he has those thoughts about me as well. 
* **Does the same thing every night.** Magic the Gathering tournament coverage on the weekends and speed run streams during the week. Sometimes there's dota in there for variation. 
* **Is overly competitive.** He tried teaching me the rules to Magic but got caught up in teaching me pro strats. He will brush off playing Dota 2 with me when I specifically ask him to play with me, then I hear the next day, I played 3 games after you went to bed. He used to make separate accounts to play with me and his friends so we wouldn't ruin his rating. 
* **Is extremely sexual and handsy all the fucking time**. He touches my boobs and ass *constantly*. If he sees a nipple or buttcheek at ANY TIME he will get up and try to touch. At first it was flattering but now I have mini panic attack when I put my shirt on because I'm afraid he'll see and try to touch me when I don't want it... I literally rush my clothes changing and caught myself rushing when he was out of the house once, it's that ingrained. I've had to snap at him to draw boundaries here, like no PDA at work or in front of coworkers and less PDA around friends because it's awkward (and he complains about a couple in our group who are heavy on the petting when we're out yet he does it to me!!). When I told him he was giving me clothes changing PTSD, he laughed and slapped my ass. 
* **Has a huge ego about nothing**. He doesn't like cutting people down but he loves building himself up and the things he chooses as his sources of pride make no damn sense to me. He lords this half-finished 2D video game he is working on by himself as some grand achievement, like his hobby is better than others because he's writing code like he does at work. He was a STEM major and has that superiority complex yet he is dating a former media major (no offense to you, LSharkk. I was talking about the *other media majors*). He doesn't drink so he's morally superior to partiers or something and gets the biggest kick out of trolling me when I come back from the bar. 
* **Gives no fucks about ANYTHING.** Including himself. He wouldn't go to the doctor for his heartburn for an entire year; finally I lost it after he was up for 3 days in a row because of how bad his acid was when he was reclining. I never cleans unless I ask. I loved this meh whatever quality about him at first, especially because I take everything so personally, and I wanted to learn how to get his armor of impassivity. But now I realize...
* **He's the world's biggest pushover**. It's his defensive mechanism against his controlling family. His approach to them is I pick and choose my battles because some of the stuff they say is just too ridiculous to bother with. Pick and choose your battles isn't supposed to mean roll over and give in to people's insane demands to avoid confrontation. But I guess that's what it means to him. 

I discuss these issues in rotating order every other month, we have a blowout fight that ends in me storming out, only to return to a clean house with folded laundry put away and everything I complained about in the fight totally fixed. I get stars in my eyes that he decided to listen to me, and we go back to the month-long doldrums again. Then he stops cleaning. He leaves parties early then doesn't come at all. He starts getting handsy again. And before I know it, we're back to normal - and our normal is me manipulating him into doing what I ask to avoid a fight. And I am conscious of my manipulation and it is driving me insane!!! I don't want to have to be a raging bitch just to clear the stove of week-old pots or to get a moment of privacy in the shower. 

We had another fight this weekend over where to eat (a common trigger for fights for us) because I knew he wouldn't stick up for himself and agree to anywhere I said even if he didn't like it, so I grilled him on what kind of food he was in the mood for to make sure his personal wants were accommodated. We walked all the way to the restaurant we compromised on, walked in, couldn't decide what to order... and I just lost it inside. I excused myself, walked home, and drove to a friend's house for the night. He didn't text me or call me and when I got home (to a sparkling kitchen that smelled like bleach and a fully restocked closet... we didn't even fight about these things) and gave him the cold shoulder, he just sighed at me in a way that said, Really, you're mad at me for not knowing what to order? 

I am so tired of caring for someone who doesn't care about himself. What's the point of putting someone else's needs before your own if those needs are sand? Giving him the silent treatment obviously upset him but he doesn't care enough to bring it up with me so we end up ignoring each other until I decide I've had enough. I caught myself wondering how long we would go on ignoring the other person if I didn't step in and was like holy shit. That is so manipulative... giving my boyfriend the silent treatment until he asks me about the silent treatment is so 3rd grade.

But it's like this with everything I listed above... I have to beg and plead and sometimes bribe him to get him to come out with my friends, I have to bite his head off after he makes a judgmental comment to get him to think about what he's saying, I have to tease and bully him about how dumb it is to sit on your ass and play video games all day before he'll come to the park with me, I have to feign sadness or rejection to get him to pity me enough to play games with me, I have to slap his hand and bitch him out when he tries to grab my butt when I'm changing, I give him the harshest reality checks I can when he tries to flex his mechanical engineering dick (which I think is making me resent him...), and basically, to get him to man up for a moment, I have to become the Wicked Witch of the West. Being a huge bitch improves it for longer than discussing it with him does. And we have discussed that meta so many times that I dread having that you never change argument again. When I ask him why his fear of me getting angry is a better motivator than his love, he rejects the whole statement and promises to make things better. It's so darn frustrating! Especially when I'm the one starting the arguments... if it were up to him, we wouldn't even discuss it, we would just carry on with life like nothing happened. 

Besides, I don't feel like he *should* change. If he wants to sit around and smell his own STEM farts every day, he should find someone who loves that about him and not expect me to change my standards, and vice versa. If he hates bars, he shouldn't change himself into a party person to please me. 

I don't know what has to happen for this to fucking work. I can feel myself crafting up ways to manipulate him into doing dishes (spoilers: it isn't by waiting for the kitchen to get so dirty that there's a spider infestation), into leaving me alone in the closet, into walking to a restaurant for just one drink in the summer air... and now I can't tell if I'm scheming up ways to make him into someone he's not or if this is our own weird way of communicating and it just needs refining.

She came home at 10:30 yesterday morning-- not 7 like she has been for the past 3 weeks. She said that she had some drinks and had to stay at her friends house. She said she would've been home earlier but she overslept. So she hits the couch and proceeds to pass out until it's time for work.

I'm struggling very hard to reconcile this. If she were still alive, he'd be with her, and it's unfair of me to even see it this way.

In a if you don't do this, then we can't have a relationship  kind f way.  

The path to that conversation was long and built over 20 years of verbal abuse, emotional manipulation and bad parenting.  My wife and I agree that what had to be done was the morally correct thing to do, so I stand by her.  But, how do support her?  How do I tell her it's going to be 'OK' when I really don't think it's all good...?

Some of the context might help, her father and new wife are trying to adopt again.  So the adoption agency asked all biological children to write letters giving praise or addressing concerns.  My wife, (and others) wrote letters addressing concerns about their (my wife's father and step mother) health, and their failure to mix two households.  

Their health is one of two major concerns, the father has been in and out of the hospital three or four times this past year for a leg issue, (Cellulitis), the mother not taking her newly diagnosed diabetes seriously.  

The second issue is that my wife's brothers were both kicked out of the house by the step mother.  Both were about 16-17 when they came to live with me and my wife.  It boils down to an insensitivity to their problems, medical or otherwise, as well as not treating the two boys like her own adopted children.  

The third issue is that she is now aware of all of the emotional manipulation that she has been raised in.  I'll take a direct quote as I was present for this gem;

My jaw hit the floor...and you could see light bulbs turning on in my wife's head.  She started spouting out all the times he had done things like this over the years.  Very disappointing coming from a man who we both respect for his wisdom.

Because my wife expressed these issues in writing to the adoption agency they lost their home study and are not going to adopt again.  The kicker is that in the same breath my wife's father said well...we weren't going to adopt this time, but you cost us our $3,000 home study because you did the right thing I hope you are proud!  

I'm kind of at a loss on this one, please advise me on how to support my wife, she feels like she is doing the right thing. She has no ill feelings towards anyone involved.  She feels like she is A. protecting a future child from this type of abuse and B. protecting us from taking on another 16 year old in the future.

I was with my now ex for about 3.5 years. I love her deeply, and we'd often have conversations about marriage and kids. Yesterday she dumped me. 


A little background on me just so you understand the job point made later: I'm 24, and recently got out of school. I was in a program that's basically a pre-med program but have since decided to go the PhD route (which was a hard and depressing time for me, big life decision). 


The breakup itself went like this. We sat down and I immediately realized what was happening (I had a feeling beforehand, and even brought our scrap book to give back to her). She said she has been feeling sad for a few months and that she can't pinpoint the reason why. But, she did list some reasons in general. She mentioned that she doesn't want to have to tell me things I should already know, such as getting a job (like I mentioned, was in a rut and began looking after her telling me kind of snapped me back into reality), or how she's feeling or communication issues. She mentioned that she thinks we're different people with different perspectives who just don't see the same things the same way. One example of this, which I brought up during, is that she wants to raise her (future) children jewish and I said I'm okay with that. But, she thinks I'm simply going along with it and she doesn't want that. She wants someone who is into it, I told her I would be completely into whatever my family is doing and thus whatever she is doing. Lastly, on thanksgiving I was a bit hungover because the night before I hung out with friends. I get to see my friends together rarely these days, so that's like our yearly party. Bad decision by me, but I didn't think it'd be the end of the world. She said that that event was the event that pushed her from ""I'll work on it"" to ""Let's break up.""


After this, realizing I couldn't calm this down to a potential fix, I went to my car and got the scrapbook and gave it to her. We talked a bit more and I pleaded for her to try, that I could show her we're great. She said she can't, but throughout the whole conversation she said multiple times that she loves me. That her loving me made this the difficult decision that it was. So, my question is, if a girl still loves someone but broke up with them for the reasons listed above (which I personally don't see as true, because they're all things that are workable) can the relationship be salvaged down the line?

21049,Non-Romantic,2ykxk3,"Short story: I let a friend and a priest (2 people) borrow my $5000 trailer for priest to move to his new digs.  I was out of town during the move, but the least I could do was offer the trailer since I couldn't physically help out.

It is now weeks later and it was discovered that the vent/sky light is gone.  Snow, moisture collecting inside the trailer, wet plywood interior, etc.  the elements can ruin the inside but caught early enough it will dry out and be fine.

Seems appropriate to ask the borrowers to fix what they broke, right?

Long story:  I used to be very involved in the catholic church.  Personal reasons, I just don't go to church any more.  My friend has been pressuring me to return especially since there is a new priest who, by all accounts, is awesome.

I need to return to church.  Not ready yet coz that's another can of personal worms not willing to share here.

Saying something about this puts the friend and the priest in my life to begin the go to church conversation again. Ugh.

Anyway, the priest got a new house and I wanted to help move him but couldn't so I offered my trailer and they accepted.  This was Feb 21.

My trailer is stored off my property so I told them where to pick it up and return it when finished.  I didn't bother to inspect before or after but my fiancé happened to notice last night that the vent/sky light was gone.

Did they break it? Or was it like that before they picked it up?

My fiance surmised that the friend must've cleaned off the snow on top and knocked the skylight off.  They didn't travel under any bridge but maybe they backed it into a garage?   I really just don't know.

But how the hell do you NOT notice you broke off a 12x12 piece of plastic covering off the roof of the trailer?  Wouldn't there be noise?  Broken parts?  A cool breeze and sunlight coming through the trailer?

If it was like that when they picked it up,  Wouldn't they tell me my interior of the trailer is exposed to the elements so I should fix it?

So let's say this is just a total brain fart on their part.  I can totally afford the $50 to fix the cover of the vent.  So just forget it and pay for the repair and whatever.  No big deal.

OR, would they WANT to know?  Gosh I would feel so bad if I unknowingly broke someone's property during their sincere good gesture and not be given the opportunity to make things right!

So what would you do?  Tell the friend and the priest they broke my trailer or just fix it and forget it?
   
**tl;dr**: Do I just keep this to myself or would he rather know he broke my trailer?

So, she says she hasn't felt anything for her boyfriend for several months now, going on for 5, and they're not having sex at the moment, however she's getting confused as they live together, and although she doesn't feel anything for him any more, she still misses him when he's away at work or whatnot, so she's unsure. But the way I see it is that it's only half of the issue, as her boyfriend has his own issues with trusting her to go out with her friends and with severe depression.


She's worried that as she's suffered with depression in the past but it has been improving, his getting worse will make hers worse, and she doesn't want that. Her initial plan was to remove her contraceptive implant as it can apparently often be the cause of some mood changes and such, and maybe get her sex drive back, after that she plans on spending time away, such as a week or a few days at a friends or her parents in the hopes that she realises what she hasn't got when it's gone, as like I said, she misses him when he's out for the day despite everything.


In short I want to see if she can get some solid advice from the people here, personally I feel like 5 months out of a year relationship is a very long time to have no feelings for your partner and it may be time to consider walking, even if spending a week away makes her miss him, I don't know if that would rekindle a love that hasn't existed for 5 months.

188492,Non-Romantic,2fscw1,"Background info; i've been dating my BF for 4 years now, and I've known this girl for at least 7. 

I found out a couple days ago that a ""friend"" of mine was telling my boyfriends mother some pretty bad lies about me, claiming these were all things I told her in confidence. I haven't hardly talked to her since the 4th of July, when we were at the same party and she was perfectly friendly and spent most of the time with me. These things I did/planned to do are all pretty serious accusations, such as that I was cheating on my current bf, that I cheated on my ex (who she dated after I broke up with them) with my current bf, that I tried to get pregnant with my ex's child (which is absurd because I dont want children I dont even really LIKE kids), that I was only with my bf for his money, and that I would dump my bf for my ex, and that while her and my ex were dating I tried to get him to cheat on her with me. 



I really dont know where all of this came from. I thought we were on good terms, even though we had some problems previously before I really knew her (apparently her boyfriend told her I hated her??). It is all very strange. Now, the only reason she told my boyfriends mother (as my bf never considered her a friend even though we all hang out with the same people) is because they recently started working together. My bf works in the same mall, but in a different store. His mom came to talk to him at work about all this, apparently concerned that these things might be true but not knowing if she should trust this girl who just recently started working with her. When we first started dating, his parents werent really fond of me, but now they love me. (or at least claim they do)



I havent done anything yet. I dont talk to her hardly at all, and I dont plan to now. I asked a couple mutual friends if she had been saying anything about me but they didnt talk to her much either. I dont really know if I should. Neither my BF or his mother beleive anything she said, so that is a plus. We do have the same friend group, even if its only for larger holiday parties I dont know what might happen if I see her again and she tries to be all friendly. My boyfriend might flip out if I dont first.

47355,Relationships,2f2at9,"For the past year and a half or so I've been involved in an odd relationship with a girl(19M with 19F), I should start off by saying I have never been in an official relationship, I need advice I'm desperate. 

We started off as friends in an online game then gradually began conversing heavily outside of it. I developed feelings for her after some time and with the unfortunate help of some liquid courage, asked if the feelings were mutual.

She thought about it, said things like I know you would treat me right, Nice as a friend. yet in the end she explained to me she had already had a relationship with someone online and It just wouldn't work.

Try as I might I couldn't stop talking to her, although we had agreed we could still be good friends. Honest to god I tried it, but my heart had grown so attached, the longer I talked with her the more I was torn apart by longing and resentment.

Eventually both those feelings surfaced, words were said that I regret and can't retract, we talked scarcely afterwards, wasn't the same.

If we were alone, we could be alone together I shamefully thought, but she found someone eventually. This hurt me, more than I knew I could hurt and a repeat of history wheeled on by.

I didn't want to care anymore so I didn't, I wasn't eager to talk to her anymore, I wanted to forget and I almost did, but without caring I feel like we got closer.

She sent me lyrics and songs sometimes, some of them had to do with love, and sometimes we'd exchange our favorite ones to each other, not saying much afterwards.

Then I noticed her responses were unusual even for her, uncaring, recited, bland, I felt I was annoying her typing so much getting back so little, so I asked her if she liked me as a person, the response was thus, I like you as a friend, I look past the annoyingness, and Id like you as a friend, as a person if we were friends, I'd hate you... Confusing only to me...?

I told her she should find people she actually enjoys talking with (bit harshly), then she said If we were friends to which I asked so we're not friends?, to which she then said No you fucking moron, god you're stupid

149645,Relationships,1imq3x,"Together for 1.5 years, the incident happened about 5 months ago. She's 22, I'm 23. I broke up with her for a number of reasons that, in hindsight, could have been addressed in a conversation. I was hasty and irrational and stressed from school. tldr: I'm an idiot.

**BACKSTORY**: Her male friend, let's call ""Tim"", was good friends with my gf. When I first met her, Tim and his friends were pretty integrated with my girlfriend and her friends. Tim was an introvert: smart, quiet, gets uncomfortable easily, while my girlfriend was generally very playful and blunt. He was around her a lot, hanging out in her dorm or with her friends, and she would act flirty with him; she would make sexual jokes with him, walk around in her underwear around him to ""watch him get nervous"", and generally act very loose around him. She's a girl who likes attention. Guys like attention, too. Whatever, no big deal.

I come into the picture later on after being introduced by mutual friend. I'm beta, so I didn't make any moves or anything. Plus, why would anyone be attracted to me? But over time, I get to know her, we become friends, and before long, we develop feelings, we date, we become a couple, things are pretty great. 

But Tim sticks around. She knocks off the sexual behavior, but still remains flirty with him, and says things like ""I used to have a weird attraction toward Tim, but now I don't"" and ""I have a thing for shy, introverted, quiet guys"", of which I am not and Tim is. Maybe she was insecure? Playing with me? I don't know. I confronted her and told her to cut that shit out, and to not talk about other guys like that around me, especially the stuff about Tim. She apologized, and **she was adamant that she had absolutely no feelings for this guy**, and it hasn't been a problem since. But, how she acted and what she said still sticks with me to this day.

During a rough part of our relationship, Tim lecherously reveals that he has feelings for her. No surprise there. She's with me and is a very loyal girl, so obviously, that goes nowhere. Everything stays the same.

But, at one point, during a bad time in my life, I break up with her.

**MAIN ISSUE**: 3 months after the break up, we both want to be back together. We agree to talk. Long story short, during the break up, she ""kissed"" Tim, and then on another occasion, she ""let him kiss her"". Quotes because that's exactly what she said. I'm sure there was more to it than just a peck on the cheek, but for my own sanity, I didn't press for details. To her credit, she told me all of this unprompted because she felt like she needed to tell me. I don't speak to her for a few days after this, but realizing that I shouldn't be upset because I'm the one who dumped her, we talk again and get back together. Everything resumes swimmingly, I love this girl, cool, awesome. She didn't do anything wrong because we weren't together. I realize this, please don't beat me up about this.

But, every once in a while, I can't stop thinking about her and this guy. What they did, the feelings, the passion, her explicit denials of this guy, the comments she's made, the things she's done with him. It just kind of keeps flooding back to me. It's been 5 months, and I still think about it. She's done everything she can to help me get through this, so at this point, I feel guilty for bringing it up again. But, I can't seem to stop thinking about this and this guy. Is he more attractive? Is she settling for me? Am I not what she wants? Am I not ""mysterious"" enough? I can't stop these thoughts, and I don't know what to do.

One more thing: my gf may seem like a vain, superficial attention whore, but she's not. She's incredibly sweet and would do anything for me. Just trust me on this one.

**tl;dr**: 5 months ago, while broken up, gf makes out with good guy friend, someone who she's been very flirty with before. We get back together. I know that she was definitely justified in her actions since we weren't together, but I can't stop the negative and self-deprecating thoughts, and I can't help but think that she wants to be with him instead. Do I keep bringing it up until I get over it? Do I just keep it bottled up? Is there anything that I can do?","Girlfriend[F/22] made out with her best friend while we were on break.

150508,Relationships,1gfhuo,"So I meet this girl and she fell for me. I liked her so we got together. In two months it went from a passionate kiss to feeling like my destiny was intertwined with this girl. But not in a way that made me comfortable.

 Looking back it feels as though every time she said something romantic I responded positively. Partly because I was feeling good about things and partly because I didn't want to hurt her feelings too. Our time together was very romantic and passionate except that I wasn't really feeling the romance. I don't know why but I put it down to having out-grown it because for me it tended to lead to over attachment.

 I've learned now that responding positively was great at the time but ended up with the girl feeling very romantically entangled and me suddenly realizing ""Oh shit! If this isn't happening for me how am I going to find my way out without shredding the heart of this girl who feels like I'm the one.

Why would it not be happening if things were going so well?

There is distance involved and she has a child (10M) and she works weekends and I work weekdays. Seeing her has been difficult and even the times I do see her they feel exhausting due to travel and the child is also often present.

For our most recent weekend together the child was also present, He is a good kid but he kind of wants to take over. I know this is natural for a child but I feel a little as though after 2 months when we are together I find myself in the position of step father. That realization hit me like a train.

Also through the necessity of attending important events this girl has met a lot of my friends and all of my family already. She added all of these people as friends on facebook and also shared photos and tags of us together on facebook too (this is something I wasn't keen on because I felt as though the early days of our relationship were on display for not only her friends and family but also mine). We initially met at my brothers wedding and she was life long best friends with the bride.

Our short relationship has been mostly text message based. Just over a week ago I decided this was too much for me and I told her as much. I explained about feeling suffocated and how the tags on facebook etc freaked me out and how it was all moving way to fast and how I found the distance difficult and that I didn't think I could handle the roll of stepfather and basically that I didn't think we could be together.

She was distraught. Rather than go into even more detail I'll just say that after about an hour or more I had said that I would give it a second chance. It was hard hearing her hurt and I did have some feelings for her and I thought maybe I could make it work.

Now 10 days later the relationship feels soulless. I can't seem to emotionally invest in it and I think she is scared to in case it all ends like it had threatened to. We are playing a slow game of pong with bland text messages both of us hurting behind the paddles without being willing to broach the subject. I'm afraid to hurt her and she's afraid to lose me.

Is it possible for me to rekindle this flame in my heart that a fear of all the things that came at me so fast quenched? If not, how do I save this girl from hurt? I will be hurting a young boys mother and my sister in laws best friend. I don't want to but I feel like I have to.

Thank you

114466,Breakups,290oe1,"My ex and I were together for just over 5 years. We split just under a year ago. When the split first happened, we decided to go on a ""break"" and actually remained on good terms for about two weeks. During those two weeks, we would see each other and talk probably about every three days and were actually working on resolving some of the issues that had lead to the breakup in the first place. (The biggest issue was his job - and how much he hated it and wanted to quit. His work dominated everything. He became incredibly depressed and pushed me away). About two weeks after we decided to go on a ""break"", he sent me a text asking me to not contact him again.  

While I was hurt and sad, I respected his request and did not contact him. He reached out to me about two months ago and wanted to ""start talking"" again. I felt as though the primary issues behind the breakup were temporary issues, so I was receptive to starting up a friendship and seeing how things developed. I told him that I wanted to go slow, that I was receptive to dating again, but that I didn't we shouldn't jump back in to a boyfriend/girlfriend situation right away. He agreed and we starting dating. 

It didn't take long for the feelings to really start to come back. The roughly ten months we spent apart was good for both of us, because we both grew and matured as individuals. We both realized within the first week of dating again that we wanted to give our relationship a shot again. 

He decided that before we were official again, he needed to come clean about something. He went on to explain that prior to the breakup, he had been carrying on a relationship that, in his words, ""bordered on being an emotional affair"" with a female co-worker. He went on to say that nothing physical ever happened, but that she was very flirty and suggestive with him and that sometimes he was very flirty and suggestive with her. 

The issue at hand is this: although he no longer works directly with this coworker, he thinks that he wants to maintain a relationship with her as work friends. He said that since she was transferred to a different department, they stopped interacting for several months but they ran in to each other one day in the cafeteria and had lunch. She said that she ""missed her friend"". He said that he told her that we (my ex and I) were working on fixing our relationship and were basically back together. Ever since that day, she has been texting, calling and instant messaging him multiple times a day, and at all times of the day. He says it's always just friendly stuff - nothing flirtatious or suggestive. 

I think he should have no interaction with her (unless it's absolutely necessary for a specific work related purpose). He thinks I'm being overly dramatic because (in his words) ""he's never going to do that [almost cheating] again"". I feel like given the history between the two of them, it's inappropriate for her to reach out so frequently. I have asked him to ask her to stop. He doesn't think that's necessary. Although I haven't met this woman, I feel she's purposely trying to drive a wedge between us again (he still had all the texts from her - he let me read all of them and there were several from this coworker  where she asked when he was going to leave me, why he was still with me, etc.). I feel like she has bad intentions and I don't want her around. He thinks that I'm being unreasonable, because he ""no longer cares what her opinion is"". 

Am I being unreasonable to feel as though he should have no interaction with her?   

**tl;dr: Ex and I are working on rebuilding our relationship; he admits to almost having a borderline emtional affair with a female coworker; He thinks I'm being unreasonable for stating that I do not want him to have any interaction with her (unless he absolutely needs to for work - and that it's strictly professional).

140083,Relationships,1fulq6,"My girlfriend and I go to the same university, I live in an apartment during the school year and at home during the summer. (Home for me is about 45 min away from campus.) She lives with her parents year round.(~10 min from campus).

We have know each other for about 8 months and have been dating for about 5 months. We are quite in love, enjoy spending time together, have the same sense of humor, same sense of adventure, are very compatible in the bedroom, just generally great for each other. She helped me through a very difficult time in my life when I was dealing with some legal issues and I have always tried to be there for her with whatever issues she dealt with. We have the same religious views (skeptical/agnostic/not super concerned with it). However...

Her parents are very very strict Muslims. She was able to keep me a secret up until about 3 weeks ago when they caught us in a compromising position at their house (we thought they were at work all day). She didn't have an extreme amount of freedom before, but now they have taken away every shred of her freedom. She goes to work and back home and her every movement is tracked on her cellphone. We manage to get together once in a blue moon but never for very long. They have been very clear that she is never to date anyone and she must marry an older Muslim man soon.

She wants to move out. She wants to get the hell out of the borderline-abusive environment but relies on them financially and is worried she wouldn't be able to survive on her own. I have repeatedly made sure that she wants to leave for herself, I don't want her leaving just to be with me, I want her to do it if she really thinks she'll be happier on her own away from her very controlling parents.

I often feel uncomfortable seeing her when I know she is sneaking around and could get in more trouble but she tells me to stop worrying, she can make her own decisions. So I leave that up to her. I also feel uncomfortable offering her advice about moving out because I believe a relationship with her family is much more important than our relationship at this time, family comes first. But she is so obviously unhappy it makes me sick to see her that way, and I know it wouldn't change if I left because she has always had a strained relationship with them. I really love her and I don't want her to make a bad decision because of me, even if that means I see her less or not at all.

Honestly, I am willing to wait for her. My family really loves her also. All my friends have commented on how much of a match we are for each other. I think it will probably take her at least another year before she is financially able to support herself away from home and afford the rest of college, and if our spark dies between now and then so be it, but I don't think it will. I just wish she could have a better relationship with her parents and they would accept us as a couple, but that is just not in their culture. She was in a really low place today and said it might just be easier for her to marry an older guy now so she can get out of she house, I don't think she was serious but I think it does show how desperate she is to get out of the house. I would offer to let her live with me once the school year starts but I don't think that is a good idea, our relationship is still young and needs time to grow before we should move in together.

I'm not sure what my question is... I guess, what can I do for her now? And also, if she approaches me about it should I let her move in with me?

So last Friday at my very good friend ""Ted's"" birthday party, my friend ""Jay"" came along. We went out on a bar crawl, had a great time, yada yada. He met a girl named ""Sarah"" that knows Ted and they hit it off, talked, etc. 

So me and Jay are gonna be roommates in like a month and a half. We're not super close, but we're former coworkers and we hang out every couple of weeks and have a beer or play video games. We're bros, basically. He's always really chill and usually up for anything. So the day after the bar crawl, I go over there to hang for a bit and tour a model apartment (we're staying in his complex since it's cheap and nice.) He mentions him and Sarah have a date that night (Saturday.) I wish him well and go on my way.

So last night (Sunday), I get a text from Ted telling me that Sarah had to get picked up from the date by one of her friends. Apparently she was dizzy, incoherent, and repeating herself. I don't know all the details but apparently it was after Jay got her a glass of water that she started feeling this way. Her friend said that Sarah pretty much felt like shit all through Sunday and was really afraid that Jay had tried to drug her and potentially rape her.

Obviously, the first concern here is Sarah's safety, and thankfully Ted and her friend are helping her out. Problem is, her parents are being really terrible with regards to helping her get tested. I dunno her insurance/financial situation, but we're all trying to figure out a way to get her tested as time slips away and the drug leaves her system.

My question for you, r/relationships, is what to do about Jay. Obviously nothing has been proven yet, but I have a really bad feeling about this. I don't think he'd be the kind of person to fucking date rape a girl, but obviously I don't know him extremely well and don't want to associate or especially live with someone who is this kind of person.

What do I do? Do I confront him? Do I ask him straight up what happened? Do I try to ask him general questions to get his perspective on how the date went?

The last year, we're lucky if it's every other month that we fool around. I've tried talking to him numerous times about it, with no luck, only the ""promise"" of ""trying harder"". 

He claims that sex just isn't as important to him as it is to me, but I'd like to think that if you love your partner as much as he says he loves me (and after 4 years and living together for 2 I think it's a lot) you'd want to have sex with them more often than we're having it.

147165,Non-Romantic,3amthr,"Almost two years ago, my older sister stopped speaking to me because I de-friended her on Facebook. No, really. She's very outspoken about politics, and I'm a milder sort of person who avoids conflict wherever possible- so, while I only use my Facebook to keep up with family and post pictures of my dogs, she somehow always found a way to start political drama on my Facebook page with my other friends. I have enough stress in my life without dealing with her causing pointless arguments online, so I asked her to stop- and she blew up at me. Seeing as there would be no reasoning with her, I de-friended her. She promptly went nuclear.

She is a volatile person at best. She gets angry easily, blows up over stupid stuff, and holds grudges. I gave her time to cool off, but when I tried to talk things over with her, she refused to do so unless we talked over the phone. I told her that I wanted to use a mode of communication for working this out in which we could take our time and carefully consider each other's words before answering, and that I would be happy to work things out with her over email- but no. She had decided she wanted to yell at me over the phone, and if I wasn't game with that, she wouldn't talk to me at all. When I didn't give in to her demand, she insulted the fact that I'm on medication for mental illness, and she hasn't spoken to me since.

We've even had a family vacation since then. For the sake of my very old, clueless grandmother and my parents who desperately want us to work things out, I was nothing but nice to my sister and her husband through the whole trip. I treated them as I normally would have, tried to include them in conversation, and did my best to act like nothing had happened, to spare the family any drama.

She responded by acting as if I didn't exist for the whole trip. It was so blatant that my dad called her after the trip and chewed her out for being so rude when I had been nothing but nice, but she just got angry and hung up on him.

Later that year I went on a trip with our other sister to a convention that happened to be near where older sister lived. Older sister doesn't like our other sister very well, either- they barely talk except at family functions (and I can't truly blame her, as other sister is hard to handle over long stretches of time due to her own major issues). After the trip, though, older sister called and complained to our mother that we didn't invite her to join us for anything while she was down there. I'm still completely befuddled over the fact that she wanted a sister she doesn't like and a sister she's not speaking to to invite her out for funsies when she's been acting the way she has. But the end result? Mom insisted we get her a ticket for this year's convention, which is coming up in September. So I'll be stuck sitting with a sister that is not speaking to me- I'm hoping I can slip away and let her spend all her time with our other sister, but that will probably end in making both sisters mad at me for avoiding them.

To be honest, I don't like her. I mean, she's my sister and this may sound awful, but my life is so much more relaxed without worrying about what she's going to be blowing up about next. I would be perfectly content with letting her continue to ignore me. I've told my parents that I am not willing to approach any kind of mediation unless she agrees to apologize for the awful things she said about my mental illness, and I don't think that's too much to ask. 

However, she's coming home in a couple of weeks to visit, and she's bringing the 17 year old kid she and her husband are in the process of adopting (and geez, while her husband is okay, I can't think of a worse possible candidate for the title of 'mother' than a woman with a ridiculous temper who doesn't speak to her sister for two years over something as dumb as Facebook). There will be family functions, and of course, everyone else has been hearing about this kid from her, while I have been out of the loop- which is fine by me, except the family will expect me to come and meet this kid, and play nice with my sister, and I am just...so emotionally exhausted at the thought of yet another two weeks of being unfailingly nice to someone who treats me like shit. Right now, that's what I plan to do- play nice, be nice to the new kid, just nice nice nice as long as I can stand it. I just lost my job, I'm stressed beyond belief, but I can't just skip all the family gatherings over the 4th of July without ruffling some feathers, and then suddenly I'll be the bad guy for being 'unreasonable' by avoiding her.

And then the convention in September. I don't even want to think about sitting in an assigned seat two seats away from her for three days at an event that I've always gone to for a good time. I originally went to this convention on my own, then one sister butted her way in via parents (they paid for her ticket) and made it more stressful, and now I'm getting a nuke dropped on one of the things I've been looking forward to the most by having to bring along another sister (they paid for her ticket, too) who hates my guts. My need to be non-confrontational is making me miserable, because my parents are good people and I genuinely want to keep them happy, but in order to do so I have to compromise my own happiness by indulging a sister who's unbalanced at best and a sister who's been giving me a two year cold shoulder.

I'm stuck. If I try to pull away from the awful sister even more, my parents will be devastated. If I keep the parents happy by continuing to pretend nothing is amiss, then I have to continue letting things I enjoy get soured by a sister who doesn't give a shit about me. As it is, I plan on not going to the yearly convention anymore, because if I go my parents will inevitably buy tickets for both sisters, and there isn't much point in going to something that's supposed to be fun only to have it give me a few extra ulcers each year.
   
TL;DR; My sister flipped out over stupid Facebook drama, gave me the cold shoulder, but my parents still want me to play nice. Is there a way to convince parents that it isn't reasonable to ask me to be nice to someone who treats me like shit?","My [29F] older sister [32F] hasn't spoken to me in two years - I'm totally okay with this, but the rest of the family is not",0.0,FALSE,91,27,1434915718.0,/r/relationships/comments/3amthr/my_29f_older_sister_32f_hasnt_spoken_to_me_in_two/,NonRomantic
42163,Relationships,1fn350,"I (21/F) have been dating my current boyfriend (22/M) for a little over 2 years now. Although our relationship was great at first, I feel like the fire has burnt out. Am I just bored with the relationship or should I end it?

We first met on the internet and immediately clicked. He made me question things, and I liked that. We talked over the phone for 3+ months before we decided to meet. When we met in person it was love at first sight. We continued to talk and occasionally met up for an additional 3+ months before we decided to move in together... in his parents' house.

We have the type of relationship where we don't always expect to be entertained by something. We are mostly content simply in the presence of each other. Therefore, at the beginning of our relationship it was okay that we weren't going out on dates regularly or doing anything, really. However, now -- 2 years into the relationship -- it feels like a chore to ask him to do anything with me. We may live together, but it doesn't feel that way even when we're in the same room. When we're out of the house, we live his life his way 24/7. The fact that the male friends I had were scared away by him and that I suck at making female friends, I feel like I lost sight of myself trying to keep up with him. 

At the beginning of our relationship we fought... a lot. We were finally getting to know each other and didn't really expect any less. One thing that always has bothered me, though, is that we can never talk about our problems. Every time I try he either leaves or the fight gets worsened. I always try to give him some space, but we can't always just let our problems dissolve and not resolve. The worst fights are the once every 3 months fights that we have where he threatens I don't love you anymore and we're over just to get me to shut up when he doesn't realize how much that hurts me. I don't think it's wrong of me to want to talk about our issues.

He's always been extremely immature, refusing to spend his money wisely or move out of his parents' house with me. I feel like I'm taking care of some kind of adult baby. He's controlling about who I talk to and what I do (which is why I stopped trying to have friends). However, he never fails to tell me that he loves me or that I'm beautiful. I love that, but I'm not sure if that's all of what this relationship is left.

I've been thinking about leaving him for a long time. However, since I moved over 300 miles away from my family to be with him, I'm not sure I have the balls to do it on my own, or if I even really want to. I've gotten to know his family, especially his parents, and treat them just like my own and vice versa. I enrolled in school here, although I'm on summer break now, and I have a great job that I love. I don't want to throw everything away for nothing, but I don't want to stay for nothing either. My family is always in my ear telling me that I should move home and it may be distorting my vision of what I really want. Am I bored or am I over it?

He moved away for his job. I went away to college and we'd casually keep in touch. Fast forward a year after he moved away, I met another guy (we will call him Gary). Anyway, Gary was in the military, only in my hometown for a few months. We connected quickly. Spending all the time together, sharing inside jokes, truthfully I think I loved Gary. Right as he is getting ready to leave, I learn that Ben is moving back. 

Gary was aware of Ben and when he left, I don't remember being sad or thinking much about it. I saw Gary off at the airport and then a month later, Ben moved back and we moved in together, got engaged, eventually married. We have shared so much, grown together.

I love Ben, but our relationship isn't without its faults. I've never cheated and I don't believe he has either.

He said I bet you don't remember me. Of course I did! We talked all night. He was very sweet. We reminisced about our summer together. Then I got freaked out and asked for him to stop talking to me. He's also married now. Then, after talking to him and telling him it wasn't fair to my husband. Everything reminded me of Gary. I played this fantasy over in my head. I couldn't stand not talking to him, so I messaged him again. This time he broke it off, saying he couldn't keep things platonic and didn't want to hurt me.

We slept together fairly quickly and ended up going on a few 'dates', which usually ended with me sleeping over. He admitted that he liked me and wanted to see 'where this was going' and we would end up going on dates for non sexual reasons.

Anyway after one of our dates he expressed that he wasn't feeling well which was an obvious sign that I shouldn't come over. I understood and kissed him goodbye, which was I guess too bold of a move and caused him to explain to me that he didn't want to end up hurting me and he ""likes to take it slow"" with any budding relationship and it wasn't uncommon for him to simply become platonic friends with girls he dated. Yet again, I completely understood and apologized for giving off any vibes that implied I was expecting anything more and decided to back off for a while. 

Anyway after two weeks of not really hearing from him he messaged me expressing that he wanted to see me again [I assumed for sex] and I was fine with that and agreed to it, and four months later we're still at it. However, when we're together he insists on paying for everything and we're back to going to lunch/dinner just because we enjoy each other's company. We spend almost every weekend together and if we can't see each other we try to at least get lunch during the week. He's expressed to me that he wants me to be able to tell him anything and he always wants to be there for me. I also went on vacation recently for my birthday and he admitted that he 'really missed me while I was gone' and 'just wants this to be good' which he said he had trouble coming to terms with because he felt it meant he was getting attached. In the same conversation, however, he told me if i were to meet someone and I really liked them that he'd be happy for me and would wish me the best, and that he 'still wasn't sure he was ready for a relationship'. Yet again, I explained that I didn't mind this being casual and we ended on unclear terms.

He took me out to a really nice dinner recently, got me a present [special occasion] and while this is my first fwb situation I don't think this sort of thing can be classified as ""casual"" which is what I consider a fwb to be.

114640,Breakups,2phwc2,"Backstory: Tinder. We matched, let's call her Sarah. You can call me Waldron. She messaged me first saying I was cute, we started talking a bit. Tells me at one point that she doesn't see this going much further. Reneges on that, tries again to speak to me telling me she doesn't want to multitask people and isn't looking for casual sex, something more, and I decide to meet up with her (maybe first mistake)

We see each other at a coffee shop and we talk for a few hours, get along pretty well and I'm feeling very happy about it. Kiss at the end of the first date, we were playing with each others hands throughout. She initiates most of it, we plan to meet up again. Doesn't happen as soon as we wanted but it does happen again the week after where we have japanese food and talk more and learn more about each other. She was a boarding school kid cause she was a troubled teen.

Hang out again a week later (saturday) and we smoke weed together (first time being really high, was fun) make out and the like, seems as though things are going well! So I see her for two days (tues/weds) and again things are going well. We get along really well, she seems to really like me and vice versa. Some more just fun and then emotionally deep talks, learning more about her past (apparently was engaged, guy cheated on her. I tell her my insecurities and fears, how my ex left me by going to another guy she said she didn't like, no idea if cheated). When I ask her about what we are and what a ""snuggle prince"" is she says she doesn't really know, that she wants to take things a little slower cause of that cheating episode by her fiancee but she says she's emotionally invested in me. I clearly am too and am happy about this. See her the following Saturday, get the chance to stay over but I realized I had to go home unfortunately, very good time though

Seems like she's really into me right? We also hang out another 3 times the following week, talk on the phone and text a lot. She takes some substances one night with a friend and suddenly says ""even if I don't show you the love you deserve know that I do"" also slips out a ""love you"" the following night after she plans a ramen night for us where we make ramen and stuff and she seems super super sweet and awesome, and tells me more about her past. We see each other the following two days on a whim, I meet her best friend and she tells me that she usually doesn't introduce her dates to her friends so quick or something and says I'm ahead of the game so yeah I'm happy and like gushing about it to my friends. She told me she told her parents too. I'm a brown dude dating a white girl so that's hard for me, but I tell them as well the following Saturday. We're talking more and more on Saturday, she's venting to me about something says ""ily"" and stuff. Agreed to come to a concert with me on Sunday and my company's holiday party, says on Saturday that she'll still have time for me Sunday and sounds very excited to come to both concert &amp; holiday party. She went to her ""friend's"" house she said (same as the one mentioned in a bit)

Gets unresponsive on the Sunday, I assume it's cause of her essay that she had to work on. She says she can't come so I get upset, clearly and just let her do her thing of course. Monday no response as well - that night I ask her on facebook what happened cause I saw her on. ""not so cool right now. someone smashed my phone and slashed my tires."" I am obviously worried as hell so I say please tell me if you need anything, she isn't very responsive. I go to sleep and don't sleep very well since, you know, I'm worried. The following morning, I wake up and look on facebook.

She's now in a relationship with some guy she had mentioned before (the guy was dating her ""friend"" for 5 years and she said she didn't like him or anything, the ""friend"" was a little paranoid or something or another she told me when she showed me some texts. also dude is a drug dealer as per her words lol). probably red flag, I just ignored it cause I assumed that she was actually truthful and just there for the purpose of seeing her friend, rather than being interested in him as she had said since he's controlling or something

I ask her about it and her response is, ""it is what it is"" and I say back ""okay. I want my stuff back"" because like a fool I let her borrow games and left my uke inside her place. still haven't gotten it back.

what the f***? anyway it's been a week and I dunno why I'm still thinking about it so much. everyone says I dodged a bullet. I bought an umbrella she wanted and now I dunno what to do with that either, still on its way! I did really, really like her and believed her words to be truthful and that it was reciprocated. I was being myself, nice as possible so this was a huge betrayal of my trust and really hit me where my insecurities and fears were. I don't know why it happened or if there was anything to be gained for her

not really sure why I posted this here, either.

tl;dr: dated girl for 1 month, leads me on heavily and drops me for some fella. think she's kinda off her rocker :/

edit: I inquire about my stuff again, she says she'll tell me the next time she's home and she'll leave it outside for me. another wtf. I tell her no, tell me next time you're home so I can come pick it up and she ""sees"" it but does not respond. been like 2 days now lol

We have a very long history that could be made int a small book. She was my first love and since I was 13 y.o. I was desperately in love. Then, when I was 16 we started dating, but then broke up because I became overly attached. The second time we dated my feelings started to cool a little after a while and she used it as the reason for us to break up (she admitted it later).

The third time is still continuing. This time we were in Universities, then we moved in together, then had our first trip to the sea, our first camping trip, our first hitchhiking trip. For a while everything was great. but, as before, my feelings started to cool off a little.

Right now I am sitting in a flat that we rent in a city far from the one that we used to lived in (the war in Ukraine made us move). I's been a year of us living in this place and our relationship seems to be falling apart. She is always in doubt and in pain that I might not love her, and my sincere anwer to her question ""Do you love me?"" is ""I don't know"". We have been together for so long that I feel that some part of me wants to leave, to experience new things and to feel freedom. At the same time I don't want to loose a very important person in my life and make her unhappy (I have faild though, because she is already very unhappy because she feels I am losing my interest).

141945,Relationships,29x6jx,"I love my girlfriend. We've been going out for 8 months. She is probably one of the best things to happen to me in a lot of ways. We click together and relate on a level that I certainly haven't related to anyone before. At this point in my life, I feel like she is the only person that I can fully open up to about everything. 

However, my stupid anxiety is ruining it all. I can't handle stuff that I should be able to handle. So I try to deal with it myself, until I boil over and let it out on her. I don't think she's doing a thing wrong, but I'm still really struggling with what she is doing. 

And example of this happened earlier tonight. She went to hang out with her friend. her friend then asked her if she wanted to smoke some weed (she has never smoked before). She went to hang out at her friend's flat, smoked weed, went to a party, hung out with a lot of guys, etc. I felt awful about this, and basically bullied her into letting me pick her up before her night was properly over. And when I did pick her up, I saw she was wearing a very revealing dress. Look, I want to clarify that I have no problem with her doing any of those things. Not rationally anyway. I trust her, and don't think she'll cheat on me. I smoke weed myself, and certainly don't think I have any authority of whether or not I can tell her what to do or wear. But rational thoughts isn't how anxiety works. I still feel awful when she goes into town, or smokes weed, or whatever, and I don't really know why. I guess it doesn't help that she wasn't like this in the beginning. Back when we started dating she wouldn't wear revealing clothing, smoke weed, drink a lot, etc. But again, I don't think I  should (or can) stop her doing these things. 

This has lead to a tumultuous relationship. She causes me to have the best times, but also the worst (not her, more me causing it, but I think you get the idea at this point). I'm really unsure of what to do. I want to break up with her to deal with my shit and not burden her with it, but then I feel like I'll be losing the one person I can talk to. I want to do best by her (she really is a great woman) but I guess I'm selfish. Furthermore, she does want to be with me. I'm very confused of what to do. I need to get help for my anxiety.

*I've always known my gf is an introvert and just realized how important this might be as I was writing this that she might need some personal space.*

My gf (24F) and I (29M) have been together for 10 months. Like most relationships, we were crazy about one another. Constant texts and it was easy to tell that she was all about me 24/7. I gave her a few days of the week to herself and highly encouraged her to go out with friends and I would do the same.

Sometime after, she expressed that she felt like I wasn't making enough of an effort to see her and it made her sad, because she would always come over or one of us would pick up the other to go do something, but when she couldn't drive to my place, I would say that I would see her the following day or the day after. I corrected this by going to pick her up and bringing her to my place or sometimes spending the evening with her at her house.

This made her super happy for a few months and we got into a mode where we were seeing each other 6-7 days out of the week and texting each other every few minutes when we were away from one another.

Over time, I noticed that she wasn't as excited in her texts or in person as she was before. I had a talk with her about it just before Christmas and she said she wasn't as excited with me as she used to be and that she hated she felt that way and she didn't know why. I asked her if she was interested in someone else, but she said it wasn't that--and that if it was, she would've broken up with me. She mentioned the idea of wanting to take a break.

The following day for Christmas Eve, I brought flowers to her at work, made a DIY giftcard expressing that I wanted to do everything I could to create exciting new memories for us and I noticed that things were getting stale. I also made her a video about our past 10 months together that ended with a message that said that I still want to make her happy. She loved it and said that she didn't want a break anymore.

It's been about 3 weeks since then and I spent the evening with her 2 nights ago and we had some great sex and she was super stoked about being with me. This morning, I noticed her excitement level in her texts dwindled some and I think that it's a sign that her excitement level might subside again.

37413,Dating,2olfni,"In the early summer last year I started seeing this girl, we'll call her Jill. We met in July and started seeing each other pretty frequently, but with no labels. I had just graduated and was living/working in Boston and she was from the area. Throughout the summer I was looking for a full-time job in New York because that's originally where I was from and I wasn't going to put my life on hold for someone I just met.

I got a job offer at the end of July and found out I'd be moving back to New York to start in mid-August. We were still talking, going out to dinner or drinking, and spending most nights with each other because our schedules allowed it. And as all things go, it started out and somewhat of a fling, but I think we both started to get emotionally attached. We were both lamenting over how we didn't want me to move back to New York, but understanding that it was something I had to do.

The day came and I left Boston, moved back to New York, and started my new job. We both still texted quite frequently or called/skyped with one another. A few weeks into the job I found out I'd be going on an extended project just outside of Boston and I'd be there for roughly two months. I was excited when I found out and immediately told her. Although she'd be back in school she agreed that we could work something out and still see each other.

We saw each other nearly every day that I was there, whether it was dinner, or just sleeping together, it was an every day thing. As the project was winding down it was apparent that something was wrong. We had never once made it official that we were dating. She had explained to me early on that she'd never had a serious boyfriend and was more interested in having fun/enjoying college. Whereas I had came from a fairly long-term relationship of 3 years, but was on the same page and didn't want anything too serious. One night, to my surprise, while we were laying in bed she told me straight up that she didn't want to see me for the remainder of my project. I didn't really know what to say so I asked why and all the feelings came out. I pointed out to her that even though we never said it, we've basically been dating for the last three months and yeah it sucks that I have to go back to New York for a while, but I offered to make it work.

We tried to keep in touch once the project was done and I was back in New York, but we both had our own lives and were busy and eventually fell out of touch. Over the next year we did the Hey how are ya conversation on holidays and birthdays, but that was really it.

Fast forward to today. I took a new job, with a new firm in the Boston area. I had a really shitty time in New York and my first job and felt like I needed a big change to get out of the negativity surrounding New York. I walk in on the first day and sit down in a conference room with my new coworkers and immediately make eye contact with one of her old roommates, what a coincidence, right? Even bigger coincidence, after talking with her friend for a while I find out that Jill has also accepted a job offer at this firm and will be starting in January 2015. After almost a year of not really talking I was indifferent when I found out, but deep down inside I kind of had some of those feelings come back.

Jill texted me to congratulate me and to say that she had heard I started working at this firm. We start to catch up a little over text, but nothing really came out of it and I figured it was business as usual. A few weeks go by and I get a text from her on a Thursday to come grab a drink with her and her roommate. I oblige and meet up with them. We all catch up, shoot the shit, and by the time we leave I'm under the impression that this was purely as friends. 

A few more weeks go by and I text her on a Friday to see what she's doing. She invites me over to pre-game before we head to a bar. With the way things were going I thought it was purely friendly. A couple drinks at the bar and things start to change. We both get a little more touchy feely, but nothing at the bar. On the way back to her apartment she asks if I want to come back up with them. I do, so I go with them. As the night is winding down her friend that was visiting asks where she can sleep. Jill offers up her bed and turns to me to tell me that she's got to be up early. I tell her that I'll let her go to bed and I'll talk to her tomorrow. On my way out the door she grabs my hand and kisses me goodnight before letting me slip away.

I didn't really know what to think and still don't. A couple days later I text her to ask if she wants t grab dinner with me one night after Thanksgiving. She tells me she won't be around that week because her nephew is having surgery and she's staying home to help, but she'll let me know when she's back in town.

This week she texted me to let me know that she was back. I tried to set something up for this weekend, but she already had plans to go out in the city Friday night to a corporate happy hour for her particular department. As it so happened an impromptu happy for my department came up and so I asked if she'd be interested in meeting up later. I'm not sure if it was because she had already been drinking, but she avoided answering the question and we never got together.

Now that I've had a day to mull over it I have no idea where our relationship lies. We had something that was fun, which were her exact words when I asked her if she ever thought about what might have happened if I never moved back to New York. A year goes by and I live under the assumption that we're just friends. Then it all goes out the window with one kiss goodnight. Am I overthinking this? Is she just looking to have something that's convenient? What can I do to not seem too emotionally invested if she's not? Or should I just tell her exactly how I feel? (This one I think might ruin our relationship entirely if she's more interested in sex and I want a relationship seeing as I don't think she wants something serious based on what I know about her)

I am a 30 year old college senior who is finally finishing up my degree. After previously not attending school because I didn't know what I wanted to get my degree in, I had to put my college education further on hold when I moved back in with my parents to become a caretaker for my grandmother at the end of her life. My grandmother passed two years ago and once she did I completed my two year degree and transferred to a smaller college not far from home. I will graduate with my Bachelors in April of 2014.

As you can probably surmise, meeting classmates is out of the question due to my age. Unfortunately the college does not offer graduate programs, so my chances of meeting mid-late 20 somethings that are back in school are nil. 

Whenever I try to meet someone my own age, they are almost always established professionals who have been out of college for a while. I do very well in school (two time Dean's List student and on pace to graduate with Honors) and I work two on campus internships - unfortunately, it pays very little. As a result, I make nowhere near the money someone my age should make because of still being a student.

My question for the ladies is would you reject someone like me out of hand for still being in college at 30? I am finding it extremely difficult to even get responses from people my own age on dating sites. Should I simply put my dating ambitions on hold until I graduate and get a steady job?

For what it's worth, I am of average looks and have been told I'm handsome by some women. I am 5'7 and 170 lb, so I could stand to lose 10-15 lbs. I work out and run daily.

tl;dr - I'm a 30 year old college senior who can't attract women my own age because I am not in my career, and I'm too old for my classmates.

Some backstory - Have two sisters, Janet and Lynn (changed names though in no way are they innocent) who had children at 15 and 16 each. I'm the only other child. They went on to have a few more kids afterwards each. Both lived off of the state for the last 22 years. Janet lives with my mother ( in her 60s )along with her two teenage kids who constantly disrespected and destroy things. She is dating a 21 year old aspiring white rapper (his description, not mine) who is, trying to or already has, moved in. She neglects her kids and they are raising themselves. My mother works all the time to support them and not that it's her responsibility to raise them, she tries and they are so awful to her. They are frequently skipping school, destroying everything and causing trouble.



Lynn, is the other one who lives very close in her section 8 apartment. She is always looking for money from my mother because something broke, she owes bills and they are getting shut off, her car needs repairs... Well, recently her 13 year old son stole and totaled her car, that my mother bought for her in exchange for rides to and from work, which she usually refuses to do anyhow. this ends up meaning the one good, oldest niece I have (out of 9 nieces/nephews) has to drive. On occasion I'd have to leave work early because she calls crying with no ride in.



My mother recently bought a car for herself so she could get to work because Lynn was so unreliable and then the car she bought her was totaled. Lynn is very manipulative and somehow is now in possession of the car all of the time. She and her oldest daughter cruise around in it and when my mother needs it are frequently late or don't show up.


Now on to the money stealing. After all of this I know my mother is enabling this activity but also is being taken advantage of clearly and it doesn't make it ok. So, the stealing... she frequently gives my sister Lynn her bank card to get her pills or other stuff from the store. My sister has her pin and gives the card to her kids to go to the store as well when she doesn't feel like running there. Sister and kids frequently buy stuff for themselves, then it turned into having stuff shipped that they bought online with her card. Now they are actually stealing money from her account at the ATM.



Lynn and her kids along with Janet's kids would steal any cash, change, winning scratch tickets (another sad part of this considering she has no money after the vultures get it). The only thing I can say for Janet is that she finally went out and got a job (minimum wage due to no skills but trying, nonetheless) but she spends most of the money on weed for her boyfriend and self. She's so demotivated and really just socially disabled as well as mentally just not quite there.



Back to the stealing.. She's had thousands missing over the last year. She knows it, knows where it's going but just refuses to do anything because she feels helpless and also feels bad for them.



I really don't know what to do to stop this from all happening. I don't live so close and frankly, I run my own business and don't have much time to myself let alone to deal with this but I can't watch this happen to my mother anymore.



I can't get her to move out away from there because she's scared my sister/kids will be homeless.



I am going to ask her if I can be in charge of her finances and make sure no one has access. I'll get her a dunkin donuts card (all she ever spends money on, really) and a reload able CC so I can limit the amount in there that will get stolen as well as offer to deliver her prescriptions/other store items to her as needed.



Anyone who has experienced something similar or someone who can just even offer some advice I'm totally at a loss on how to handle this. It'd be too painful for my mother if I got authorities involved and Id really rather not go that route because of younger children and social services already being involved in their lives.



I'm a single guy in my 30s and would be shelving my social life to move my mother in with me. I'm getting to old to be doing that and I hope that's not selfish to say. Do want to help her out and get her out of this mess. She doesn't deserve it.



TL;DR Have sisters and their kids who constantly rob my mother but she knows about it/enables it and I can't get her to stop. She is broke from them. Need advice to fix this please.





**UPDATE** Thanks everyone for your input. I took her out today and had a talk with her. We are going to go to the bank on Monday and change account numbers and get new cards reissued. Then I'm going to handle her bills for her, give her preloaded cards for Dunkin Donuts and the supermarket. Also load up a prepaid card with a little cash and put  SEE ID on the back so cashiers will refuse usage by anyone but her. Then can put the remainder into savings so she can have a down payment on a new apartment for herself.

 Trying to convince her to move into a condo/townhouse community (not a senior one) so she can be comfortable and have the amenities of it.  Somewhere away from them. One doesn't drive and the other does not have a license. After talking her finances over, with what she makes after taxes (She's a nurse) which is roughly $1000 a week she should have money for a new place in about 3-4 months. I told her that is plenty of time for my sister to figure her living situation out. 

To give a good example of how much of her money is taken each month she makes roughly $4000 a month. Between rent, water bill, food and other necessities she spends about $2800 per month on the high end. Bump that up probably another $100 a month on scratch tickets. The other money gets stolen, used to buy stuff not for her (hasn't bought herself any new clothes, except for work, in probably 5 years), pay for bills that aren't hers.

171272,Dating,2460ya,"Brief backstory: I'm a college junior. I started dating this other girl back freshman year, she studied abroad sophomore year, we tried things again junior year and that relationship went up in flames. It never really ended until quite recently. 

I met 25F when I was a sophomore, and was instantly impressed. She is cool, funny, smart, beautiful, the works. I was too afraid of screwing things up with my current relationship to try to start a new one. I know that this was a mistake. The first relationship really didn't pan out, but that's another story.

Long, long story short: 25F is graduating in less than a week. She is going to take a year off and try to do some online grad school in her hometown, far away from where I'm going to college. After that year, she reports to the Air Force for a 4-5 year rotation in Hawaii. I really, really like her, and have reason to believe she likes me too. Obviously, it sucks that I've waited until the last minute.

I really want to tell her how I feel - that I always liked her, that I want to be with her, and that I am sorry for never having told her sooner. I am just worried if this would upset her - assuming she had feelings for me too, would she be upset that I waited this long to tell her, now that she's leaving? Would it be better not to tell her at all? 

This is weird for me to be so sappy but I've even caught myself thinking ahead 5-6 years - that maybe when she gets back we'd have a chance together, and how wonderful that would be.

Background: I met him in college, and we hit it off right away and have been dating ever since. When I met him, he was in a normal weight range at 5""10 and 140 lbs (a BMI of 20.1). He's always fluctuated +/- 5 pounds and our friends always comment about how skinny he is, but we never worried because at this point he wasn't underweight As we were both in college, we didn't eat very healthy and I gained a great deal of weight (5""4, 140 lbs). I was unhappy with this, and started dieting this past year.



When I started dieting, we naturally ate out less. He supported me in my diet and I am so happy and grateful for that. I'd like to note that he's never been controlling in any way and he lets me eat as I like - whether I'm following my diet or if I want a ""cheat meal"" once a week, he never comments on it and respects that I decide what to eat and when. So that's why this next part is really difficult...



As a result of us eating out less, graduating college and no longer eating greasy, fastfood, his weight has dropped dramatically. He is now around 130 pounds (a BMI of 18.7). He wasn't a muscular guy to begin with, and I have to admit that usually my ""type"" is someone who is vaguely muscular. He's now borderline underweight and almost weighs as much as me. 


I still love him, but I can no longer admit to being physically attracted to him. On the bright side, being skinny hasn't had any adverse health effects on him, and to be honest we are saving a lot of money which is helping him make a dent in his student loans. I just feel horrible and guilty for not being attracted to him. I also feel that I am being a hypocrite - because when I gained a lot of weight he did not say a word about it.

103639,Relationships,2cgnef,"Let me preface by saying I have severe anxiety and ROCD. She didn't know this at the time and neither did I as this is my first relationship.

We've been together for 10 months, engaged for almost two. Her birthday was in December, only two months into our relationship. I was with her, along with four of her good girl friends and one of my guy friends. She had a little too much to drink and was just happy all her friends were there and as jumping around, grabbed two of them and gave them small pecks. All in good fun. It did bother me a little but I forgave her because we didn't talk about specific boundaries at that point. Also, up until that point, she's never kissed a girl in her life. It was with no emotion and had no feelings attached to it because she said they're her friends and would never think of them like that. It wasn't passionate, , just a face grab and small peck because she was so excited. 

One of the friends she kissed is bi-sexual, we did not know that at that time. She told me, ""I've never done that and don't plan on it again. I'm sorry I did that I was just happy to be with my group of friends all together again."" 

What I'm asking is, is my anxiety just playing with me or do you think this is actual grounds to break up for? It's never bothered me, never popped in my head, never felt like I was cheated on. I moved past it for all these 8 months. I just think my anxiety is trying to nit pick every possible thing as a reason to break up. I know I don't want to break up, I want to stay with her, obviously if I plan on marrying her. I just my anxiety has it out to get me. Thoughts?

110806,Relationships,2xpyel,"This is my second post on reddit about this issue, the first being on r/confession. I rewrote everything more accurately and to the point. 

To start with, I was recently diagnosed as Borderline Personality Disorder. I am currently doing therapy and Dialectical Behavioral Therapy, but I can't shake the feeling that I might have covert Narcissistic Personality Disorder. I'm almost certain I have it comorbid.



Ever since I was little, I thought being loved and admired is what would make me happy in life. That mixed with emotional neglect from my parents, isolation, unrealistic feedback about my actions (being criticized for insignificant things as well as not condoned for bad behavior), and a proneness to being hypersensitive to criticism, I shut myself from the world in my own mind, and became obsessed with the idea of romantic love and being beautiful as my primary sources of happiness. I also grew up with my dad being mostly preoccupied with himself and his own greatness. To this day, he truly believes he is better than others... and projected that onto me. He must have seen himself in me because he constantly told me that I was special. So growing up I started having extremely unrealistic expectations of myself, thinking this and believing that  satisfying these two needs (receiving love and being beautiful) would make myself feel whole. But feeling special + being skinny = entitled disrespectful human being. I spent ALL my spare time preoccupied with how to be beautiful to the standards of my own expectations. When I found out I wasn't as beautiful as I thought, I tried ''fixing'' myself (for me, that was my physical appearance). I expected the world to love me because I was special. I never listened in class, never learned anything; I lived in my fantasies. I didn't care about ANYTHING. Except performing and arts. I manipulated others, I've let go of friends like dirty old socks, and I deflected blame onto others for my mistakes constantly. I also always felt deep shame about who I was. I always knew that I turned people off whenever I opened my mouth, but I had developed a defense mechanism to ignore this and any constructive criticism it might bring to me. So I've been living in fear and shame this whole time.



To this day, I feel the need to control the perspective that others have of me so I manipulate them by presenting myself as more interesting and complex than I really am. My identity isn't known to me. I am a chameleon; I mould myself to becoming who the person wants to see. I mirror them to please them so I get their love. Pretty fucked up. But the denial kept this truth hidden from me.



And then I took hallucinogens with my SO. My bubble shattered. They made me see who I was, empty and superficial. They showed me I didn't really care for others. They showed me I knew nothing of the complexity of reality. And now I'm lost. I know life is not black and white, I know I care about my SO's well being because I believe he'd be better off without me. I want to spend time with him and create memories with him. I know I have this amazing opportunity to develop something deep. But I've been so manipulative about my self image, and I've lied by omission to him about my identity and true feelings through manipulation, creating a false sense of reality and a false sense of who I am to him. This is my primordial lie; my personality, and how much I care about the people in my life (so of course, him too). I think I care only about myself. When I think of this and cry and feel guilt he asks me 'what's wrong'? I feel the utter incomprehension of his perspective, how he has no idea of all of this. And I can't bring myself to tell him the full truth, of how I think I don't care as much about him as he thinks I do. But I know I care about him because I want him to be happy. I also know I've never manipulated with malicious intent. But the guilt is crippling me. I've faked so many times my happiness and that I was listening to what was going on around me (what we were watching, what we talked about) because I was focused on my own thoughts this whole time. Everything mirrored me. But I know he's a beautiful person and if I'd heal and I'd be better this could be great. But I feel so much guilt for having deceived him all this time. How am I supposed to tell him I've never given two fucks about other humans before? That I faked being happy so well that he believed me?



The worst part is that even though I do feel guilt about doing this to him I'm hurt more about the idea of losing him. I know he deserves better than this. But he's my best friend. I've never revealed myself as much to anyone else. And he accepted me this whole time. And I feel that I relate to him a lot. This is the strongest connection I've ever had, and I might lose it because I'm seriously fucked up.



It fucking hurts.


I don't know what to do with this. I need advice, perspective, whatever. Please, any insight is greatly appreciated.
Also, we're actually 21 and 29 yrs of age, not that anyone really cares but I'm paranoid about him stumbling upon this post. So yeah.

**EDIT: Well, I can always count on reddit to make me feel like crap about myself.**

This happened a few weeks ago, but I've needed some time to process things. So I did as most of you suggested and contacted him asking if he would be okay with grabbing a coffee and talking about things. It was really hard for me to get the courage to do this. I get a response from him almost immediately. I'm paraphrasing here, but it goes something like:

I think you were right. I don't think it's a good idea if we hang out anymore.

I was really shocked and hurt by this (quite hypocritical of me, I understand). I asked one more time, telling him I wasn't happy with how I ended things and really wanted to grab a coffee to at least talk in person a little. And he responded that it would be easier for him if we didn't. He said he understood how I was feeling and it's okay, and that he wasn't upset with how things ended.

Naturally, this made me feel like crap. I guess I just thought I would meet up with him and at least get all of this off my chest but he seems dead-set against it for some reason. It seemed slightly immature to me as well, considering we were together for 4-5 months and he couldn't even be bothered to spare a few minutes for me (Again, this is purely how I saw it). I originally spent way too much time and effort trying to decipher what he was trying to say, since I found his last message to be quite unclear. It's been a few weeks now and I'm still working on getting over it. 

I wasn't really sure if he just didn't care enough to deal with it or if he was slightly hurt by what happened and didn't want to hash it out again or if he just realized how I felt and didn't want to lead me on anymore.

So, yeah. I guess that's that. I'm still hoping in my heart of hearts that maybe we'll run into each other in six months and ... who knows. 

Anyway, feel free to comment. Or not. I said I'd update, so I'm just updating it here. I guess I don't really have a question other than questioning his motivation- which I should really give up on.

Thanks, all.

During deployment I was glued to facebook messenger and Skype hoping to hear from him, praying he was alright.  I counted the days and weeks and months, I loved him.  Then he came home.

170655,Relationships,27pz3d,"Hi all,
First time poster, long time lurker here. I'm hoping not to get too many trolls :)


So let me preface this by saying I'm sure there are hundreds of posts here dealing with these issues, So I'm terribly sorry for being repetitive or naive, I'm just looking for honesty. So. After getting out of a horrid long-term relationship and doing over a year's worth of self-work, I met my current boyfriend [Let's call him K] in a time of strength and emotional happiness. We met at a party where he approached me, and he began ""courting"" me, as he'd say. I felt secure, and meeting K was incredibly affirming and easy. being with him, for the most part, is as natural as breathing.


We laugh together, watch films, go out and do incredibly fun, fulfilling activities. It is a stable relationship, he is very affirming of me, and is sweet and romantic. Intimately, things are wonderful, consensual, and altogether awesome.


And then the big BUT. 2.5 months into the relationship, I blurted out an ill-timed, ill-prepared L-bomb. I immediately apologised, explained my haste, essentially retracted it (mistake #1). But at the time I don't think it was sincere on my end.


Still, as time has gone on, I've realised that I do in fact love him, which makes me giddy, so happy. Loving someone is a wonderful feeling, and sharing that love gives me great happiness. [It's also worth it to know that in past, less-good, relationships, the L-bomb has been dropped on me within the first couple months, so I'm coming in a bit biased.]


After my slip,  some new phrases became introduced into our relationship: ""I want to love you."" ""I hope I can love you in the future."" ""I don't know why I don't love you yet."" [I'm well aware that he does not love me, no disillusionment here.] These would pop up at seemingly random times, in bed, cooking, etc, and were said with deep affection and wistfulness.


 I'd tell  him that I didn't expect his love right away, nor do I expect his feelings to jump at my beck and call, and that I have many sources for love, so it isn't as if I'm a dry well, so to speak. I'd rather his certainty than empty words.


Things continue nicely, very nicely. We meet one another's families, our friends enjoy our company, we have adventures and laugh and talk and...


He's going away for most of the summer to a foreign country while I set up my job/life in the city. While together on his last night, one thing led to another and we had a conversation where I expressed a few of my insecurities [not concerning the L word, not right away.] But this led him to the L-word issue again. Mainly: ""I don't know if I CAN love you...I'm worried about whether I'll be able to ever get there."" Cue my freak-out.


This was followed by him saying ""But you are a wonderful person, so wonderful, and I care about you very deeply, there is so much that I adore about you, you mean a great deal to me, I am so happy to be in this relationship with you..."" etc. 


He says that in previous relationships when He'd thought He felt something, the feelings eventually faded, causing him to question whether the original feeling had been true. He also says that he's grown up and experienced things, which have changed him. 


I told him that I deserved to be with someone happy and open, someone who would let me in and love me, someone secure and happy and healthy. His response was that he feels that I don't deserve where he's at right now. And reflexively, I've been taught that when someone says that, to believe them, and cut the relationship before things get worse.


K has always been sincere, honest, respectful, kind, never hits below the belt, treats me well...I make myself happy, but he does add a lot of wonder and laughter to my life. It's worth noting that this was our first ""Meh"" moment, I may be reading too much into it, etc.


He's never cheated in a relationship, and all of his have been 1+ years in length. For the summer away, he wants to stay committed to me, and ideally, wants the same from me. He does not want me to seek out anyone while he's gone, but he also acknowledges in light of some of his shortcomings, that it is feasible I might miraculously find someone secure, which he would not be happy about, but would understand.


As I write this, I see that I probably didn't need to come here for answers. Most of you will likely tell me to break up with him. The thing is, he is remarkable and I am incredibly fond of him, and the relationship is young. The summer may give us perspective--I feel not great about doing that while things are in flux with him travelling and me setting up. I'd like to possibly leave it be for now, and wait until things have settled in both our lives to readdress. 


I would still appreciate feedback of course! And thank you so much in advance for the help. Part of me wonders if I'm worrying needlessly, if some things just take time. The other part wants to jump on this as an immediate, break-up-worthy warning sign. 

Thank you reddit!

**tl;dr**: Wonderful, caring, compatible boyfriend is worried about his emotional shortcomings and I'm wondering if I should hurry up and preserve myself before more hurt can happen.

I'm prepared for hard truths.,0.0,False,1,23,1402341644.0,/r/relationships/comments/27pz3d/me_22_f_with_my_boyfrientd_22_m_of_about_four/,Romantic
190075,Relationships,2cyvkc,"Some background:

**Him**: My husband has very severe chronic pain condition and his health is fragile. He can only manage ~1-2 hours of light activity per day, otherwise he is bedridden with terrible pain. He used have a successful career but has been on disability (with benefits) for nearly 5 years now due to the crippling pain he suffers. He was raised by a violently abusive father who beat both him and his mother. His mother struggled with untreated bi-polar disorder for most of their lives; she only got help &amp; meds a few years ago. His father abandoned them to poverty when he was in his teens. All these factors created an environment of chaos and anxiety during his formative years. He suffers from generalized anxiety disorder now. 

**Me**: I was raised by a very abusive single mother who is a narcissist and extremely nasty and manipulative. I cut off contact from her several months ago, but I am very traumatized by my childhood and young adulthood. I have problems with self-confidence and insecurity. I'm not depressed and do not have anxiety, but I am very introverted, have a hot temper, and can occasionally have bouts of something resembling agoraphobia.

Our relationship is....strained.  We have been together 4 years, married for 2. We have a little baby together and an 8 year old from a previous marriage (mine). At times our marriage is extreme in its highs and the love is overwhelming. He is usually very affectionate and really thoughtful and pushes himself to do his best for us all. When it's low and we're stressed and angry, our marriage is horrible. We can be emotionally and verbally abusive to each other. I admit that I've made some pretty bad mistakes. The most unforgivable ones that he brings up are:

- alienating and jealous behavior towards some of his friends (I stopped this more than 2 years ago. I was an insecure and immature idiot)

- letting the housework slip (I do as much as I can. I cook good meals, vacuum and mop once a week, do all the laundry and kitchen duties. The bathroom is the part that is hard to keep up with) 

- not doing homework with child#1 on a consistent basis (no excuse)
- not applying for better jobs 
- going on maternity leave 2 months early because I had a stalker at work
- being grumpy or irritable

I've tried hard to correct and stop these behaviors, but he cannot forgive any of them. I fully acknowledge and admit my faults and I want to improve. I can be awful and I make no excuses. He holds a deep grudge towards me for all my mistakes and constantly blames me for making his life difficult. He says that if it wasn't for me, his life would be easier, his pain issues and health would be guaranteed to improve. If it wasn't for me, he would not be on disability and would already be working again. He already had these health problems years before we even met... 

Basically anything that may be going wrong with his day is 100% my fault somehow. He also constantly accuses me of insanity. I am not insane. I'm aware that in person I come across as odd and quiet and I have a dark sense of humor. But I'm in full use of my faculties and I am always willing to put my ego aside to repair any damage or hurt I cause. 

 Whenever he does something (out of his own free will) like go for a walk, or pick up the older child from the bus stop, or do a math problem with her, he says that I drove him to overstep his limits and provoke a pain episode. He constantly tells me that I am a burden and that I've ruined his life. When he gets angry he threatens me with divorce and destitution. I've repeatedly told him that this is my worst fear (being penniless and homeless) since I grew up with this threat constantly over my head...and so did he! Today he purposely said to me: ""You don't have a home. This is my home and I don't respect you because you didn't pay for it."" He also says he doesn't care whether he's abusive or not, that however he behaves is all my fault because of my ""constant bullshit"" and that I deserve mistreatment because of what I've put him through.  He doesn't care that he's become almost exactly like his father, or that he's a cruel person, or that he hurts me, or that his anger frightens our older child.... nothing at all. He's stone cold and fine with all that. He mocks me when I cry.

Today I royally pissed him off because I asked him why he was still friends with the mom of a guy he lost touch with years ago. Granted, she is elderly, and it's innocuous, but I thought it was weird. After I asked, he exploded and told me I'm repeating my old patterns, and that I probably scare her with my nastiness, and why do I torture him so much? This escalated into a fight that lasted about 5 hours. Probably our worst one to date.

After, he said that he is perfectly fine with divorcing me and never seeing my face again. I am scared to leave because I can't afford a lawyer and legal aid is not an option where I live. I am on maternity leave until December. I will return to a modest part time job that pays ~23k/year. He says that when I go back to work, his mother will be taking care of our baby and I must give her half my paycheck as payment. If I'm not willing to do that, then I am free to leave. I said No. I said I was scared for my future. He replied that it's because I'm a selfish cow and only care about myself. 

I'm very concerned that he will use his eloquence and charm to assassinate my character to a judge and that I will lose my baby (for him and his mother to raise). He says he will also make sure I get as little as possible from a divorce settlement. He added that I am worthless, useless, garbage, a bad mother, he despises the sight of me, wishes I was dead, and dreams of erasing the moment he met me. He said he wants to vomit just thinking of the first time he saw me enter the restaurant where we had our first date. In better times he used to say this was one of our best memories... :( 

After he calmed down a bit he said that all my purchases must be henceforth approved by him, and that he will restrict use of my iPad because he hates seeing me use it. (I'm writing this after he went to sleep)

I'm beyond hurt and I don't know what to do anymore. He crossed every boundary and taboo of bad things to say to a spouse. I've wondered if he is a sociopath but that is something that seems so....unbelievable. Everyone knows him as a very sweet, kind, gentle, compassionate person. He's even very cute and boyish and unassuming. He vehemently denies having any sort of mental problem or personality disorder. His terrible side and his snarling anger face is something only I (and maybe some customer service people) get to see. Because I deserve it. Any insight or advice would be appreciated. If I sound like an asshole, or like I'm doing or saying something unfair, please let me know.

182311,Non-Romantic,2pdujh,"I have 2 brothers, 1 27 and 1 20 years old.  Well growing up the youngest got ""bullied,""  he was the ""baby"" in my parents eyes.  He was (and kinda still is) obese and lazy.  It's mean but its the reality.  He can not hold a job and doesn't stick to exercise.  He still makes our poor mother wash his dirty clothes, cook specifically what he wants with no consideration to her life in general.  He treats our mother like she's his slave.  He has the mentality of a small child.  I can not stand to see her baby him.

So beyond my mother and youngest brother dynamic, my relationship with him is damaged.   I try and treat him like an adult, ask him generic questions, hold conversations...but he sees everything I say to him as an insult.  He gets aggressive and stand-offish with anything I say.  I kinda think he's emotionally unstable from us teasing him growing up.  

He plays a lot of video games, so I tried to talk to him about the new ""Halo"" game.  The release of this game was a mess because the company's online system was completely broken.  The conversation started like this:

Me:  ""Hey, whats up...I just bought Halo""

Brother:  ""Cool I've been playing though the entire story on legendary difficulty""

Me:  ""Nice dude, whats wrong with multiplayer, I can't connect...have you played online yet?""

Brother:  ""No their online multiplayer is broken and they've been frantically trying to fix it with updates.""

Me:  ""That sucks, what the hell?  They didn't test the game enough or something?""

Brother *with aggressive loud demeanor*:  WELL YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE BOUGHT THE GAME THEN,  JUST FUCKING RETURN IT TO THE STORE IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT.

He responded like I personally insulted him.  You can not criticize or even mention anything negative to him.  He freaks out.   The fact he is usually un-employeed and overweight don't get mentioned either.

""How's the job search coming?""

""KFC for dinner again?""

This are usually snide or neutral questions that provoke his utmost inner rage.  I'm losing all (if any) respect I have for him.  I tolerate all this way more then any other person...because he is my brother.

I believe his self-esteem is damaged to all hell.  It's partly due to me and my other brother teasing him growing up.  But that was our family dynamic.  I can't fix the shit I did and said when i was 12 years old.  12 year olds tease their 5 year old brothers.  And I wasn't a completely abusive childhood for him.  We had fun times, inside jokes, I protected him, looked out for him, etc.  It was all part of the brotherly shit we had growing up.

As for my other brother, me and him are good friends.   Both out of the house, working and on our own.  We double date, grab drinks.  He sees the entire situation differently.  My middle brother doesn't go out of his way to have a relationship with my younger brother.  Doesn't go out of his way to connect or talk.  And it seems to be more efficient then my approach.  He never talks to him except when necessary, but they don't fight either.  Everytime I reach out to my younger bro, it turns negative and aggressive 90% of the time.

I blame myself, but my brother isn't making this easy as an adult.  My fear is we will be those siblings that hate each other their entire life.

157892,Non-Romantic,1qeif3,"Hi Reddit, I'm hoping you can help me with a very uncomfortable issue I am having.  (warning: the details in this post are disturbing) 

I am a white 26F.  My best guy friend is 32M and is Chinese.  His long-term girlfriend is 26F and also Chinese.  (this is relevant to the story) We live in Toronto where multiculturalism is the norm and I'm really surprised I am in this situation.  

The 3 of us were hanging out last week and we were having a nice evening.  They were giving me a ride home and I was sitting in the back seat while the two of them were in the front.  We were stopped at a red light and chatting and a car pulled up next to us with a young white driver playing loud rap music.  The girlfriend commented about how he is ""too old to be listening to music that loud"" and then followed up by saying ""ugh...fucking white guys..."".  This was red flag number 1.  

We got onto the topic of hip hop music as I am a hip hop fan and used to bartend at a hip hop nightclub.  She asked me if I ""came home every night with jizz stains on my pants because all black people hump each other in nightclubs"".  Red flag number 2.  I was shocked by this comment and decided to change the topic.  

A few minutes later, she mentioned that she posted a job on craigslist as she is looking for a dish washer to help her out at work (she is an executive chef).  She listed off the various races of people who applied for the job and ended it by saying ""and then there were these two white guys....as if I'd hire them...white people are idiots and you just know they are going to do a bad job"".  

What the fuck?

I was sitting in the back seat in total shock and I didn't even know what to say.  My male friend just sat there quietly and didn't say anything either but it seemed like he was just as uncomfortable as I was.  They dropped me off at home and I just kept re-playing what she said over and over.  It enraged me.  I just don't understand how somebody can be so blatantly racist and rude.  And the more I thought about it, the more I remembered that this is not the first time she has made comments like this, particularly about white people.  

My question is: how do I handle it from here?  I should have said something right away but I was so shocked and uncomfortable that I couldn't even really process what was coming out of her mouth.  Do I bring this up to her directly?  Do I speak to my friend first?  What would you do if you were me?  I don't want to spend any more time around this girl and my guy friend needs to know why.  But I'm worried about creating conflict with my friend and putting him in an awkward situation.

I had every intention of confronting her friday night. However, she had her own list of grievances as soon as I came home. 

Allow me to give some backstory, for context. She has been out of work since early November, and I have been the sole provider. Since then, I haven't been as diligent as I should be with my household duties. 

Her list of grievances was heavily focused on this, and wanting to make the house work more 50/50. I understand, and this was an eye opener for me, as I didn't know this was bothering her so much. So I let my thoughts go for the night. The next morning, posed to her the following question: Do I make you happy? Are you fulfilled in our relationship?'
Of course I am, why do you ask? was her response.
Then why are you posting Craigslist ad's for sexting buddies in various cities across the country? 

She was immediately confused, and vehemently denied it, until I pulled out the print out. She then confessed, and said she was mad at me when she did it, and she only got a few replies and then deleted the ad, because she realized how fucked up this was.

Those are her words, and I'm calling her a liar on that. The post was flagged for removal. The doesn't seem relevant, as I had checked the phone records for several days when she posted it, and nothing was out of the ordinary. I told her that I needed some time, and went to my brothers for the day. I came back later that night, and told her that I don't know how I can marry someone I can't trust, and that if she wants to correct it, then we need to go to counselling. 

She disagreed, and refused. So I dropped it for the night, and went to bed, with every determination to press the issue, and go to a therapist.

Fast forward to today. I logged into her email, and went through the sent items again. I found something else. A reply to a NSA ad from another city. In the email chain, the other guy asked her if she had kik. She replied that she had it installed, and exchanged usernames.

I tabbed out and logged into the Google play store as her, and checked her installed Apps. She had KIK, match.com, anonytext, snapchat (she said she removed it).

This presents even more challenges, as this was dated a month prior to the first instance I found. I honestly have no idea how long its been going on. 

I'm going to confront her tonight, which I honestly feel bad for doing, as tomorrow's her birthday.

Wish me luck folks.

was going to push counselling, found even more dirty exchanges, and apps on her phone


I'll try to keep this brief. We have been together for almost 5 years, engaged for the last year and a half. We have a son, who will be 3 in a few weeks. We've always trusted each other, and she has never given me a reason to not trust her. A few days ago, I noticed something strange in my Chrome search history. My home computer syncs with my mobile and vise versa. She had been searching her ex, and looking up pictures. 

This was an annoying discovery, but I didn't think much of it. After all, everyone is guilty of looking up and ex on social media at some point. I then noticed another oddity in the search history. how to make your number appear blocked. Now this is troubling. Was she trying to reach out to him? If so, why? This is the part where it went sideways. I checked her mailbox. That's when I noticed the craigslist confirmation email. looking for long distance sexting buddie :) is what the title read. I immediately opened the posting, and screen captured. That's when I noticed that she posted in a different city, on the other side of the country. 

The next email was a small email chain from a guy's personal ad that she had responded to. I screen captured that too. I wanted to confront her right away, but what do I say? My hands were shaking, and I was half in tears. 

I let it go for the moment. The next day, I pulled up the phone bill, and checked the text usage. Her texting has almost doubled in the last 3 months. I started looking at the logs, and saw several numbers that I didn't recognize, and we're out of state. This pretty much confirms all my fears. She may not be out right sleeping around, but I still feel like this could be considered cheating. I'm completely broken hearted, and I have no idea how to approach her about this.

He's Jewish and intends to marry a Jew. After reading your answers, I could muster the courage to tell him that it would be our last night together. He told me that he wasn't completely indifferent to me, that he would miss me if I stopped seeing him because he cared for me. 
I don't want someone to care for me, I want to love and be loved. He is also trying to stay true to his values and I respect that immensely. He cannot give me what I need. He could not understand why I would leave him - he told me he did not ask for much time, that he understood my needs but that I could keep seeing him while I find my significant other. So I told him I met somebody (I did kinda). I kissed him on the forehead and said farewell (who doesn't love a bit of drama). 

It has been a month exactly and I did not reach out, no contact whatsoever, which I'm very proud of. But I keep thinking about him everyday, stalking him on Facebook at least twice a day. It's not going away. Everyday I wake up telling myself that it will be the day I'll send him a text. To see him just one last time.

I don't want to hurt or play with anybody. I said farewell, I meant it. 

Help me stay on the right path.

142827,Breakups,33va7h,"**Heres some background info.** We dated for just under a year. We ended because we both felt something was off and I addressed it. She said she doesnt feel the same anymore because after a couple months of stressing about it, she got 'past the point of caring' (her words). Essentially, she was stressing about stressing.

The issue she was stressing about was if I liked her. She always wanted a more emotionally connected relationship and so did I. But we both were very scared to show our true feelings. But it all came out once we broke up. During the breakup discussion I said how I was actually scared about how open I should be, she said the same. But we didnt know how to fix that.

The only difference is when I finally communicated this to her (I should of brought it up way earlier), she said she wants to care and that she knows she should care and she wants to go back. But doesnt feel like it will ever be the same. She said she was numb to it at this point.

The breakup came in stages. I called her and told her we need to talk. We decided to not talk for a day to collect our thoughts. We met up, ate dinner, and spoke about us for three hours before she suggested we take a break (but we both knew that was where it was heading), then a couple days later we chatted again over the phone and I finally said that we should break up (but we both knew that it had to be said).

We havent spoken since and its been 5 days since we 'officially' broke up, but its been 9 since the original call.

70545,Relationships,2g527j,"I have been with my girlfriend for 2 and a half years. She has wanted to move out for a long time. She of course, wants to do this with me. I don't want to yet, but that's a different story. Whether I want to or not, I don't think it makes sense

My girlfriend hates living at home. She hates her family. It's not a good environment to live in but she is at least safe. Her dad takes rent from her every now and then. She receives financial aid but only gets paid around $80 per week at her job. She goes to school. She has no car and borrows what ever car is at her parents' house.

I live with **both** my parents. They pay for my education ($8000/year) and my car ($495/month). I started paying for my gas ($270/month) and my phone as well as any other expenses not including medical bills and insurance (car and health). I don't pay rent. I bring in maybe $1500/month on average. A lot of that is spent on my girlfriend but I have trimmed it down lately. I live comfortably at home and am happy with my family. Slowly, I am going to try to cover more expenses but luckily my dad would rather have me save money, so I have invested in safe stocks and have turned a nice profit.

My girlfriend believes it is financially feasible to move out together. I have explained to her that moving out means claiming to be independent, and that my parents wouldn't be paying for anything anymore. My dad said he'd pay for school but it wouldn't feel right for me. I explained that both insurances, car fees, school, food, and rent would cost over $25000 per year. I don't make anything close to that and she barely makes 10% of that. 

At one point, she claimed she was ready and was waiting for me to be ready. I wondered how, since she had no car and claims to never have money for food. She said her friends live together for $1100/month and they are fine. Except that they have free insurance from their parents, free education, and free cars. They have also moved into a very poor neighborhood which I would never feel safe living in (I know the area really well). I don't want to severely downgrade my life.

I understand I may sound spoiled and privileged. I know my parents do a lot for me. But they have taught me the value of a dollar. I work for my dad - actually am employed by him and run a lot of his company's operations. Luxury items have almost always been saved up for. The car, I don't deserve but he said he wants me to be able to keep it and sell it for when I can buy my own. My dad understands what it means to move out and said he's in no rush to make me leave. I do chores, clean, run errands, and help fix/renovate the house as if it was mine. 

My girlfriend is not convinced I'm right in the slightest. She thinks that people in their early 20s, who are in school and work part-time jobs can move into an apartment in a nice neighborhood and eat well and live amazing lives. I understand that independence is possible, but the examples I've seen are undesirable living quarters, multiple jobs, stress, and credit card debt. She seriously believes that on her $80 per week, she can live as well as she does now. I think she even thinks I'll pay for most of it. She thinks saving up money is the solution, but that would mean there is no steady income to pay everything monthly.

---

***TL;DR*** Let's set aside the fact that I don't want to move in with her yet. Am I making sense? Does she have an unrealistic expectation? Would we struggle pretty bad if we moved out? I'm saving up for the future, but not to dump it all on rent and run out in a few months. If I'm making sense, how can I make sense to her? Or is her desire to leave home clouding her judgment?

I met her in summer, we became really close friends- she was inviting me round hers for dinner, and we were becoming really friendly. She had a boyfriend though. Then in early October of this year, she randomly cut me off- I didn't get an explanation why until about a month later. She said that her and her boyfriend were in a serious relationship and that I became an obstacle for him and she understood why. The only communication I had with her for about 3 months were her occasional like of a photo of me on either Facebook or Instagram. She then randomly texted me on New Year, saying ""I hope you have a great new year- you are a terrific person, honestly. You were so understanding about my situation. p.s. dont text me with your name, i'll be with my boyfriend"" or something along those lines. Then on Valentines day, I randomly got a load of snapchats from her best friend (I'm also friends with) saying ""check your phone""- with pictures of them at a sleepover, just those two. She also tried texting me saying ""sup bro"", I responded with ""not much bro, just chilling"" to which she was like ""awwww cool ok"" so I said ""Kl"" and then she said ""shutup"". I haven't responded since. I don't want to come across as too eager, so I tried keeping it closed. I'm afraid I'll just be some sort of rebound or she is just talking to me because she is sad or bored. I was curious why she wasn't with her bf. I check her social network profiles- and the relationship status thing is there no more. She's now been spam liking my photos. I don't know what to do, I want to talk to her but I'm scared of getting hurt again and becoming some sort of ""booty call"" or rebound. I'm leaving out quite a bit of emotional details as its so long winded to write. My friends tell me that she's using me, to cheer her up when she's sad or bored and that her communications with me are never when she's seemingly happy.

110094,Breakups,2m8dif,"I've been together with a few girls during my time on the dating scene, but I've never really had to do breakups. The last two girls I've dated ended up moving away, so the split was mutual since neither of us wanted to engage in a long-distance relationship.

However, I've been together with my present girlfriend for over 8 months, and frankly, I guess I don't feel the same way about her as I did when the relationship first started. Granted, I still enjoy her company, but I've come to view her more as just a friend than as an actual loving relationship.

Throughout our time together, I've been a significant part of her life as she looks at colleges, studies for exams, and has small quarrels with her friends. She always tells me that I'm someone there that she can lean on. I don't mind being her ""protector,"" but as my feelings for her have subsided, my will to solve her problems and tolerate her sometimes needy attitude has deteriorated. Recently, I've come to terms with the fact that the longer I maintain this relationship, the more difficult it will be to split further down the line.

What I'm worried about is how it might affect her if we break up. My girlfriend takes medication for depression that she developed her first year of high school, and since we've been together, she's only ever intentionally cut herself once, when she was overwhelmed by college apps and the drama between her friends. Since then, I've told her to call me whenever she was feeling depressed, and while she's never cut herself since, she's occasionally had breakdowns where she ends up crying on my shoulder. If her present reactions occur with me around, I can't imagine how they'll escalate if I leave her. 

How can I part ways with her without causing undue harm/stress, possibly even maintaining a friendship?

I naturally like to have my alone time (due to years of being alone in high school - I explain later) and she naturally cannot be alone. She hates her family and I love mine; I can spend time just with my family in my house or alone or with my dog, whatever. She will do anything to get out of the house and she's constantly in relationships. That's fine, it's her choice but now it seems to affect me which I don't appreciate. 


A few years ago she left to go to another high school and got many new friends. This happened at the same time I had ""broken up"" with my jerk friends so I was pretty much alone from sophomore to junior year. I only hung out with her but whenever she told me she was busy with other people or had something else to do, I understood and didn't bitch her out.


Now it seems the tables have turned. I got some really amazing friends beginning of senior year. Now it seems she doesn't have many solid friends, including me and a few others. This has been the situation for about a year.  


Last summer, sometimes when she asked me to hang out, I was sincerely busy with my other friends. She would get very angry and claim that I preferred those friends and didn't want to be around her and didn't care about her etc etc. Pretty much she made my life hell that summer; I was constantly stressed about her. I did hang out with her and I still loved her as a best friend but her ragging on me so much put a toll on the friendship and I started to resent her...


College came and I didn't have to deal with those stressed since we were hours away. Now summer is back and its all over again! I try to explain to her that I like my alone time but she asks me to hang out EVERYDAY. I don't want to hang out with anyone everyday. I don't even hang out with my other friends everyday (they are the same as me; enjoy their alone time so thus they really understand and don't get upset when I turn them down to hang out). 


The other day, after the day before we spend most of the afternoon together, she asked me if she could sleep over because ""she needed to get out of her house"". She always says that and it comes to a point where whenever she feels alone or needs to ""get out"", I'm her solution. But what about me? What if I don't want her to sleep over or if I'm busy? Truthfully, she could have slept over but the whole day I was helping my parents move furniture and plant our garden that I didn't want to have to entertain anyone; I was tired and wanted to watch a movie with my parents.


After breaking up with, in my view, a tad bit too clingy of a boyfriend who would say ""I just want to be around you"" whenever I said he was too clingy, I'm starting to think something is wrong with me because she says that too: ""I just want to be around you"". So I start to think there's something wrong with me because they claim to just want to be my friend and like being around me but... but... I don't like being around them all the time...


My brother says that if she was a true friend, she'd understand that I like my alone time and can be moody and accept me for who I am.


After being bitched out so many times, it's come to a point where I don't want to hang around her as much. I feel obligated to hang out. The thing is I don't want to lose her as a friend, I love her, but I wish she could understand. I believe that she really cannot stand to be alone at anytime; I think the longest she's been single since 16 was no more than 6 months, and if not in a relationship, sleeping around (not to sound like I'm judging her on that, I don't care, but I do think that she should consider self-reflection and learn to love to be with just herself more, but idk). After my first and only relationship, lasting 8 months, I'm not jumping into anything anytime soon, but that's just me.


I've tried explaining and she claims she understands that I like my alone time but I have a nagging feeling she didn't.


I want her to understand that I don't want to hang out 24/7. Like 2-3 times a week is good for me but she asks me all the time. Say we'll hang out all monday afternoon, she'll ask to sleep over and then hang out all day tuesday. This is too much for me! I tell her that I like some alone, quiet days to paint and she asks to paint with me... 


Granted, she seemed upset when I told her I go to the gym with my friend everyday at night. But the situation is that pretty much we carpool to the gym and do our own thing; we don't talk for that hour so does that constitute hanging out? I mean, we go for a swim after... but still...


So anyways, now I feel there is something wrong with me for not wanting to hang out everyday. When she doesn't text me back for a day or two after I tell her I'm busy or she can't sleep over, I start to feel bad...like I did something wrong...


I mean, I know that we can hang around each other and do our own thing I guess but... I don't want to be around her all the time. 


Should I wait for her to text me or text her like ""How's [her boyfriend]?"" (now long distance relationship).
Usually she texts me first and is the inviter to stuff. (I also have a natural problem with being too content; like if she didn't ask me to hang out so much, I probably wouldn't ask her as much, but this was the same for years - its just my personality)


I don't want another stressful summer of being bitched out and having my day ruined because I either don't want to hang out with her or can't... I don't know what to do and its eating me up inside. 


Am I in the wrong? What do I do?....


Side note: I did try to get my friends and her together; she was intimidated and cold the whole time - not doing that again anytime soon.

Second side note: the other day she was telling me that she was stressed that her boyfriend hadn't texted her and it was 3 pm and that he said he was stuff to do at 10 am and she was saying how he should have texted her by now because he was probably done. I said she was way overreacting and analyzing. She said he used to always text her in the morning and now didn't; again I told her to chill - he texted her a few hours later -_- (trying to show her thought process)

I didn't open it since I could tell from the thumbnail, and it didn't bother me. Today I posted a story of some friends and I hanging out, and she didn't view it. It's obvious both of our behaviors are making an impression on each other.

We've both been with eachother since we were 15  and met in highschool and been together since then. Broke up once or twice during highschool due to highschool drama and then around last year we got a little more serious and took this as a real long term relationship that would actually last and was beyond highschool stuff. We get along pretty well and have a pretty much everything in common. When we grew up we pretty much shaped eachother to the people we are today.

Okay so then last March 2014 we were both in college and both busy with our respective jobs/classes/extra-circulars and so on. Apparently I was too busy and not able to visit her often since went to different schools and I'm the only one with a car. So I visit her one day and then she says it's not really working out and I'm not available enough and not what she needs right now. We break up and it's settled under the agreement and we're broken up but it's temporary and we'll get back together soon (bad idea i know).

A few months go by and we get back together in August 2014 and end up going on a trip. I use her phone since mine was dead and see some messages where she writes, I miss making out with him, I used to make out with him every day, That was around [[specific event i don't want to list since it'll give me away]]......so she made out with a dude when we weren't together it seems but then upon closer inspection of the dates the specific event mentioned falls well before the date we broke up but she argues that it doesn't. And i accepted that it might have been my misunderstanding in dates but the fact that she missed making out with a guy and hooking up with him while we were together was the thing that pissed me off. So we get back from the trip and I break things off. A few more months pass by and probably December 2014 we get back together.

The context under which we got back together was very messy. I was doing pretty okay but then i thought about it and she had all the qualities i want in someone and we have the same interests and we get along pretty well. But even that considered I was doing fine and she was doing not so fine to the point of self harm. I basically considered it and figured it would be good for me and her to get back together.

This time I just don't feel happy. Not that i was unhappy. I just am not super happy. But we have all mutual friends and even events in the future where i bought tickets that costed 100s of dollars. I don't want her to dip back into self harm or depression like last time. 

She has no idea that I'm feeling like this but i'm sure she's gotten a vibe from me but she still talks about things in the future like getting an appartment together and so on. And she couldn't be better in the relationship. She's super understanding, supportive, enthusiastic, but for some reason I just don't feel like i'm as in love with her as she is with me.


So i guess my question is should I just power though this feeling of not being happy and it's just due to being together for so long or should I break it off completely and move on and deal with the consequences of muddying the mutual friends group who are really close with her and the future events.

My friends invited me to go Vegas back in January, I told my girlfriend about it and she seemed encouraging telling me I should go. However, we too had plans to go to Vegas back in March during Spring Break. Turns out that it was too expensive and we never went. We settled for Reno. Months of have past and I occasionally would bring up the Vegas trip because when I did bring it up. She would get mad at me and not talk to me for long time throughout the day. One of the reasons she is mad is because she feels that I should have taken the initative to try and plan out a Vegas trip with her. So she feels that it is not fair that im going with my friends but not with her. Mind you however, we did go on a week long trip to LA this month. I didn't think she would hold a grudge that I never brought up going on a trip with her to vegas. I've thought about it and brought it up at times but i never took that initiative to make it happen. She blames me that our Spring Break vegas didn't go through but it was expensive and she wanted to go a cheap deal.


This weekend I am in Vegas with 2 friends of mine(guys). My SO was caring enough to tell me to have fun and be safe. Everything seemed fairly well right? Well, no. Last night, she texted me Is it bad that i don't want you to dance with other girls? I was a bit confused but I said if you dont want me to I wont. She took it the wrong way as if I would dance with them if she never said anything. My issue with this is that I'm not one to go out to clubs, get girls and dance with them. I get self-conscious and think that i can't get a girl to dance with me. So I thought it was ehhh to bring that up because i dont think im that special to get girls to dance with me.


The night ensues and im at the club with my friends. It's almost 2am and she texts me going to bed, night. **She calls me and gets mad that im still out at the club and that I haven't texted her goodnight yet.** MY reasoning for this is that I would have texted her goodnight when I got back to the Hotel. But she thinks its bullshit and that im an idiot. I get back to the hotel and I do indeed text her goodnight. 


This morning, she calls me on her 10 minute break from work and I run to the bathroom because my friends were still sleeping. She gets mad thinking Im asleep and starts being rude to me telling me I dont have time to hear you be silent, there were many topics to talk about i didnt know what felt appropriate to start with. I told my night went well but she didnt care. She was mad that I was out in Vegas and that she hates it. Even more so that I didnt text her goodnight first. We argue for a few minutes and I apoligized and understoof how she felt. Telling her I'll be sure to do that next time. But she argues that it's not. She doesn't care anymore and that I can go fuck any bitch I want, Do whatever I want, she doesnt care. She then told me to not contact her for the rest of the weekend or when I return home (monday). She told me I was single and I expressed my frustration that this had to happen while I was away. I had not intent of making her upset. The perception of how things went were different between us. She wanted me to text her goodnight before she went to sleep. I wanted to text her goodnight when I actually got back to the hotel.


 Now I'm here wondering what should my next course of action be? her actions have been repeated before and in the beginning of our relationship I was willing to fight for every argument and make things right no matter what. But after dating for a year and having to experience that multiple **MULTIPLE** times. My will to fight for this relationship has little to no effort anymore seeing by the amount of times she's reacted and what she says and does after(verbal abuse, talks shit, says mean things) I just get tired of it. I'm not a horrible boyfriend, im nice and very respectful. But the way she treats me at times and in this situation how it's handled makes me just leave it alone until she contacts me. But I just know that if she calls me first, she'll be even more upset becuase I actually didn't end up contacting her even after she said to not contact her. (Trust me, it was a serious statement, not those reverse pyschological statements.) 


I feel like letting this take its course and see what happens when I return.




**TL;DR:** Girlfriend is mad at me while I am in vegas. She complains that I'm going to Vegas with my friends and not her despite not being my fault for the reason why we didn't go when we were supposed to earlier in the year. She gets mad because I didnt text her before she was going to bed and that proceeded to her telling me im single the next morning. Because of my bullshit and the reasons I brought up.

40825,Relationships,24d03r,"Well I've posted on here before quite a few times so you can read my post history, but here's a short summary. Mid-February I snooped through my wife's facebook and online stuff and she found out, this caused a lot of underlying issues to boil up and she wanted some separation. Well once we got separated she realized she was severely depressed and had been for a few months. She did attempt one time, and has been going to therapy and is getting medication. In her own words, she is on the road to recovery but she's far from recovered. I have also gotten therapy and medication for my issues. I found out I had some delusional jealousy issues and my medication has completely changed the way my mind works.  

Things seem to be going better, but shes still not ready to move back in. There are two main issues. The first is that she gets really bad anxiety when she thinks that she will no longer have control. During previous arguments I had stopped her from leaving the apartment. I thought I was doing the right thing because I didn't want her driving when she's angry cause she can drive dangerously. However, I know that it was bad to use my body like that to stop her. I never hit her or got physical in that sense, but I did use my body and my size over her to my advantage. She's very nervous and anxious about that. Since we have been working on spending more time together, she has had random panic attacks about me being there and her not having control. I have completely respected her wishes and leave as soon as she asks. She really appreciates what I am doing, but she said that the anxiety hasn't gone away. We will be switching apartments in June, and she thinks that will be great for her because our current apartment is full of bad memories. 

The second issue is that she says she doesn't feel respected in our relationship. We're both students but she is the bread-winner for sure but I know I spoke as if I was in charge of the money. Besides money, she couldn't tell me another way she feels disrespected, but I am sure there are other areas and we are going to discuss this in our couples therapy session tomorrow. I feel like I have learned so much more about her since we've been separated. Prior to medication my mind was always racing and it was racing so much constantly that I could never fully connect with her since my mind was always out in left field worrying about something irrational. Now that all of that is under control I feel like I can understand her on a level I should have been a long time ago. 

All of this being said, does anyone have any advice? I feel like there is not much that I can do and its really up to her now. It is weird because she still talks about our future and we found our next apartment together. She talked about where I could study, and even where we could put a baby if we decided to have kids! So it seems like she thinks our future is secure, but it doesn't feel that way for me because she is still so anxious and afraid to take steps forward in our relationship. 

BTW I'm living at home and my parents are far from understanding so there's that, but I know it's my fault we're separated and going through this so I should be the one suffering.

We've been together for about 2 years now and I have never loved someone like I do him. He is my perfect partner in life and in love. I am struggling to write this post because while I'm not thinking of leaving him or anything, this is driving me a little bit nuts and I need an outside opinion.


He is a very sensitive person, which I LOVE. I love how he is in touch with his feelings and not too scared to show them and doesn't feel the need to be a real manly man. However sometimes this sensitiveness puts a big strain on our relationship. 


For example, if he tickles me and I ask him to stop, and he doesn't stop, and I say ""please stop, it's annoying"" he acts as if I have personally called *him* annoying (which isn't what I said) and turns away and doesn't talk to me out of sadness. I feel like I can't say anything slightly negative without him getting sad.


I don't want to make him feel sad and I feel like a bitch every time I do... I don't know what to do.


Another example was this: he came up to me and bent my finger back. No big deal, we do weird shit to each other all the time (me pretending to bite him for example - yeah we're pretty weird). However this time he kept bending it back until it hurt, and I snatched my finger away and acted cross. I asked him why he did that, and he said he didn't know. I said it seemed really malicious, to bend my finger back for seemingly no reason until it hurt me, and he got all sad and stopped talking to me. Now I feel like I've done something wrong, for protesting about him bending my finger back.


I know this seems like elementary school shit but it's driving me crazy. He stops talking to me/gets sad on a daily basis if not more and I can't tell if it's me being a bitch or him being too sensitive. I can't think of any more examples atm but it happens very often.

EDIT: so another thing just happened. We have this thing where one of us says something silly and pretends to be offended. We do it over the top, so the other can always tell we aren't really upset. Anyway, its just kind of annoying so he did it and I said, as gently as I could, ""babe, the 'pretending to be offended' thing is kind of getting old."" He immediately looked down, said, ""sorry. I'll go and play my game now."" Now there is this atmosphere in the room. Making me feel like I've done something wrong :/

EDIT 2: I have sent an email to my therapist and I'm going to discuss this in depth with her.

I'm in a bit of a dilemma and don't really know how to proceed. I met this amazing girl online last October. We ended up hanging out and having great chemistry, and ended up having sex on the first night we met (granted, I drove out like three hours to meet her). Relevant (not bragging, I promise) - I did make her orgasm twice that first night, and apparently I'm the only person that she for certain knew she had orgasmed with (she's been with three people other than myself, one being a long term relationship and the other two being flings), which makes it even harder to believe that I am a virgin and she was surprised I hadn't been with more women.

I'm 23, in good shape, and decent looking, but due to a very complicated relationship with my prior ex of four years, the lack of confidence to get out of the relationship, and a bit of bad luck after (hooked up with one girl who was on her period so didn't go through with it, and another but her brother was coming home earlier than expected so I backed out) , I remained a virgin. Embarassed, and scared that it would further ruin my chances as it had in the past, I lied to her and said I had sex with my ex and was not a virgin. 

Now we're about four months into our relationship, she told me she loved me this week for the first time (and I said it back since I do feel the same), we're very comfortable with each other, and our sex life is great (we see each other about three weekends a month, and have sex at least five times during each weekend). I'm having difficulty deciding whether I should tell her, since I feel that this relationship is for the long-term and would like to be completely open with her, or if I should just let the past be the past and hope it never comes up. She's a romantic, so while I feel she would LOVE that she was my first, she would literally be the only person in the world (other than my ex) to know it, and I don't exactly want any of my other friends and family knowing I lied to them, AND I don't know how she would react knowing I lied to her all this time about it.

What would you guys do? Has anyone ever been in a similar situation? I'd really appreciate any advice I can get, and would be glad to answer any relevant questions.

142135,Relationships,3gjzkf,"Starting in October, I began sleeping with this highschool friend of mine (let's call her Alina). It was nothing serious--we established that we would be strictly friends with benefits and nothing more. In January, I broke it off with her since I had to travel to another city for work. 

In February, while working in the new city, I met a lady named Sarah. We began dating soon after and all was well. The two of us were very happy together. In fact, I was even thinking that she might be ""the one"", and I was seriously contemplating proposing to her in a few months.

A week ago, Alina sent me a letter asking how I was. In that letter, she also revealed that she was seven months pregnant with my child. I was very surprised and very angry that she withheld the information from me for so long. I called her that night, asking her why she never told me. She said that she wanted to wait until I came back to the city to visit my family and such, and then she would tell me in person (???). She didn't want me to be too stressed out. Bullshit! I'm even more stressed out now that she waited so long to tell me.

The child's due in about October. I don't know what to do. Alina's an orphan--she was raised by her grandmother until her death seven years ago. She doesn't have any relatives that I know of. Alina is not in a very financially stable state, although she has been working as a nurse for a year. Obviously, if the child is mine (I'm planning to have a paternity test done after the birth), I'll support him/her as best as I can. I have a good paying government job, but I'm really busy most of the time.

Another problem is that Alina has very fragile health. She told me in her letter that she's been going to the obstetrician for check-ups, and the doctor has advised her to get a C-section because of possible complications during birth. I know it's morbid and I'm overthinking things, but I'm scared about her dying in childbirth. Then, I'd most likely have to claim and raise the child as my own. 

I don't know how to tell my girlfriend and possibly future fiancee. I want to spend the rest of my life with Sarah, but I'm afraid this complication will scare her away. I have to prepare for the possibility that I will have to raise the child by myself, and I'm not sure whether Sarah will be compliant with that kind of arrangement.

I could tell he really liked me, as could his and my friends who said they would always see us talking and laughing together. I swear I thought I found the male version of myself. I've never bonded with *anyone* so well before or had so much in common.

Fast forward to now: We never do anything spontaneous or exciting anymore. The past three weekends were spent at the movie theater since everything else is closed by the time he picks me up. He's also less willing to drive outside of our town now which gives us very limited options. There have been a few awkward silences. I can tell he isn't nearly as interested in me as before and I've confronted him about it but he denies it and says he's just been stressed from school and work. He's in my math class and I've noticed in the beginning of the semester he would show up on time and motivate me to not give up when I thought I would fail. Now he's failing and he didn't even take the last test. I don't know what's going on with him.

Yesterday when we were parked in his car, he asked for a blowjob so I gave him one because I assumed we would have sex afterwards like usual. But instead, he came in my mouth and said, Okay, I have to go to the gym now, i'm running late. He told me that he always goes to the gym on weekdays and he has to get there at 6 before the basketball courts fill up. I thought this was ridiculous and asked him why he couldn't just skip a day. I even asked him to have sex with me (which I never do). I was just testing him on how adamant he was about going to the gym. It turns out, very! He told me he was in a hurry and that he was sorry and proceeded to drive me home.

Last night he sent me a goodnight text and I replied with, You make me puke. He went, Why so? and I was about to text him an essay but feeling so emotionally exhausted, I just said, You don't even like me. He hasn't replied so I guess that confirms it. 

I know I should have told him exactly what was wrong but I figured he already knew. I mean he basically told me he values basketball over my feelings. I keep telling myself this is just a rough patch that we'll get over but I don't know...This is my first relationship and I don't want it to end badly, though I feel like the no reply from him already ended it.

85975,Dating,2k1o3s,"Alright, people of the internet. This is gonna be a long question, I want to make sure all the backstory is present. So please just go with it.

I'm a college guy on a weekend doing what college guys typically do on weekends. Some of my good female friends invited me to a party at one of their houses. We all work together and it was a good chance to unwind after a long week. It was four of my female friends and me. The party had at least 100, if not 200, people. Pretty awesome. 

After getting there, we all drink and hang out. One of them in particular is really happy to see me. We'll just call her Joan. I'm probably closer to her than the other three. We've known each other for over a year, but the nature of our job makes it so that you get to know people pretty well in a short time. 

We drink, dance, hang out. All is well in the land of college parties. She takes my hand and leads me around the party. No big deal, chicks do that all the time. She constantly tells me how glad she is I came. Again, no big deal: we're friends, it's normal for her to be happy I'm here.

One of my female friends encourages me to get a girl at this party. She tells me that the ratio is way in my favor, which it is. However, Joan interrupts and is very adament that I not pick up a girl at the party. She tells me that they're all skanks. She makes me to assure her that I won't pick up anyone – drunk chicks at crowded parties aren't really my thing anyway, I'm just there to hang out with my friends. She doesn't leave my side the entire night. We talk more than any of the others. 

At one point in the night, we were out in the backyard, away from the others (they were inside, I think). At this point, the poor thing had a bit of a breakdown and I ended up consoling her. She's fairly drunk, mind you. She cried into my shoulder. She was having some self-confidence issues around the sloots and how they dress and and I convinced her how much better she is. What are friends for, after all? 

We go back inside, everything is good again. She starts getting pretty handsy though. When we hang out in the party hostess' room, she sits next to me. She places her hand on my leg. She squeezes my knee when she wants to get my attention. Her hand rests on the small of my back. She even sits on my lap at one point. We even place our heads in the small of one another's neck. It's awesome, it really is. It's the closest I've ever been with someone (sad, but true). 

Anyways, by midnight the party starts to slow down as people get too drunk to operate their bodies and stumble home. Our group of friends dwindle as they get rides home (sober friends picking them up). Soon, it's just me, Joan, and the party-hostess in the party-hostess' room. They are pretty freaking drunk. 

My caretaker instincts kick in and I put them to bed, give them water., make sure they're comfortable. Being a gentlemen and whatnot. That's when Joan invites me to sleep in the bed with her. Same bed, right next to her. Alarms go off in my head. Now, to other guys this might seem like a good sign that she's interested. 

Unfortunately, not so much. See, she has a boyfriend. A serious boyfriend. They've been dating about the same length of time we've been friends. Earlier that night, she talked about the possibility of engangement in the future. Now you see the predicament little old me is in.

I politely refuse, despite her insistence. She isn't in any danger, the door will be locked and the party-hostess is in the same room. I just don't want anything to happen that we might regret in the morning.

The next week, it's business as usual. No mention is made of the events of the night, aside from comments about the hangovers and how fun everything was. None of the other female friends make comments about how we were acting. I mean absolutely nothing. 

One of my male friends, who showed-up midway through the party, asks if Joan and I are in fact a thing. I tell him not, to his great suprise. He claims that she clearly was into me. I tell my other friends about it, they agree. 

So here's where I'm at: we got friendly. Really friendly, in my book. We're good friends, and I don't want to jeaporize that. I also don't want to screw over her relationship by making it uncomfortable or anything. But I can't forget about what happened that night. 

Is there something between us? If there is, what should I do? Was it just alcohol and hormones playing their tricks? Am I way off on my assumptions here? Any input is welcome. I don't want anyone to get hurt here. Sorry for the lengthy post, I'm just confused as to where I stand.

My girlfriend and I have been together for a long time, and now we’re coming up to a crossroads. She’s finishing up her Master’s degree and will be looking for work soon.

78009,Relationships,2ga4aa,"Sorry this is so long but it's got a lot of involved parts

I've been with my girlfriend for a little over a year and a half. I was a late bloomer so she is my first real relationship. I have long been overweight so my track record with self esteem and dating were not great coming into it but she liked me and she was nice and physically we were kind of a match. Unfortunately, we were under a time constraint as I was already on track to graduate and move on to work about 3 hours away from school and even further from her summer home with her parents. 

We hit it off and for someone in my position it got physical very quickly, which was exciting. I have my own place and don't really know anyone in my new town, so despite the distance, we quickly fell into a pattern of visiting each other almost every weekend. About the time we met I had been expanding my horizons and building confidence going on dates as well as aggressively working on my weight. I fell off this track mostly due to the shift to a new town but the increased self esteem has definitely been a growth area for me even if I'm not as fit as I would like to be. 

She's working her way through school and while she is definitely smart she has made some foolish decisions and put herself in positions where she could not cover her costs for school and rent. Family have failed her for help and it has repeatedly put me in the position of being between her and leaving school usually via eviction. I've helped each time to the tune of over $3500 dollars and while I've tried to maintain that it shouldn't matter in love it's really starting to sting in the pocket book and in the sense of her being sensitive to my own financial responsibility. 

Also I worry about her ambition, she sees graduation as a finish line, is worried she won't find a job because she doesn't believe her rather robust educational record  will be worth anything due to her low self esteem and a few set backs with internships and her vision of the future seem to hinge on fantasies of marriage, she pours over zodiac and other fate type stuff that points to a happy ending marriage. I am no commitment-phobe but it seems a bit pipe-dream-esque and makes me a little uncomfortable that it is the focus of so much of her daydreams. 

To complicate things we had a condom fail about a year into our relationship and she ended up having a painful and tragic miscarriage about 8 weeks in. Our world's both collapsed for awhile, I did everything to try and support her but the distance did not help. I feel like I had to shelter her and she felt like she couldn't tell anyone else about it. We still have money moments thinking about what that means. It also had the effect of draining what little sexual momentum we had. 

On that subject, she has abuse in her past but has never sought treatment. The end effect is she will only be naked with the lights off, won't let me look or touch her down there with my fingers or mouth. It also can take a very long time for her to relax enough for sex to work otherwise it's very difficult for her to relax and can be very painful for her.  Despite neither of us being models of anatomy I am attracted to her but with so many limitations on sexual exploration are frustrating but I cannot express this in anyway or it ends in tears and her insistence that I'm mad which scares her. 

Her body image is extremely negative, when I compliment I am instantly met with negation. you're pretty ; No I'm not this combined with her stressful work and school schedule have definitely led to her not taking care of her appearance and dismissal of my attempts to improve my own health. It is something I care about her enough to ignore but it is a hindrance in the bedroom on both our parts and while it seems shallow it is always nice to be attracted to your partner. 

This is coming to a head this week as I had been planning a 2 week trip abroad to visit family roots in Europe even before we met. I worked very hard to save and despite the expense/debt I took on for her I was able to go. I'm there now, she was very passive aggressive the entire time and once I  got her, our jet lagged correspondence has been one of jealousy and fear I would be cheating with every hostel goer or trip companion I friended on Facebook. Other than a discovery of a porn search history that included girls from this country,  I've never given her a reason to think I would. I finally had had enough and told her she was wrong to talk to me like that, to imply I am a bad person for spending time with girls (and guys a detail she glosses over) who are not her abroad. The truth is if I didn't have to take on so much of her expenses I would have tried to bring her with me as a surprise but it became impossible after that and I thought better than to mention it as it would seem a disappointment or guilt trip.  Honestly, many girls are beautiful and friendly here but I'm no prize and even if someone were into me I wouldn't think of doing anything. If anything this behavior is the first thing to make me think how nice a relationship with someone more upbeat and independent would be. 

I just don't know. Sometimes I feel like I'm a shallow asshole trying to justify being attracted/fantasizing about beautiful women. Having been only with her it does cross my mind occasionally on a wonder what that would be like  sense but I've never acted on them and even the thoughts leave me feel guilty. These guilty feelings are reinforced by my befriending girls being compared to her cheating/abusive /pedophile father. That finally led me to push back for the first time and tell her she is wrong to talk to me like that and that she draws my imagined transgressions by way of her inability to be happy with herself and therefore unable to believe I'm (or was at least)  happy with her. 

On the other hand, my financial responsibility for her and need to constantly try to help build her ego have me feeling less like a partner and more like a caretaker and that eats away at my satisfaction with the relationship too. 

Am I just being unrealistic that all relationships have issues like this and I need to suck it up and work through it or am I maybe at a point where I need to consider my future independent of hers.

Some of my friends outside the group are encouraging me to stop spending time with her and cut her out of my life before I get hurt. I honestly don’t know what to do but I don’t want to be stuck in this state of limbo. How can I view her only as a friend? Should I cut her out (also how can I do this given we have the same friends and do things as a group)? I really don’t want to do that since I value her as a friend and losing her would suck. I know many of you might say I’m only friends with her because I want something more but I honestly want to find a way to resolve this and still have a friend at the end. This is my first time dealing with something like this so I’m pretty clueless about what to do.

She blew up big time and said I no longer give a shit about her, and that she has to continually chase. Thing is I do chase, but she wants me to msg multiple times a day in addition to calling twice a day. I just do not share that much in general.  

I am really worried as I am completely head over heels for this girl, but it seems we argue 2 times a week about how bad I am at keeping in touch.
   
I can excuse some of it as her fear that I am abroad and she may not be able to join me in Canada anytime soon, which is in direct conflict with her biological clock and pressure from parents to marry. However it seems to be getting too much.


I just want to know if I'm really in the wrong here? Should I be whatsapping multiple times a day and calling twice? Is that normal for long distance?

121308,Non-Romantic,3fcd80,"My friend is in a 4 year old relationship, and while being with this guy she picked up this ""girly"" persona, as in sometimes she starts acting like a little girl, even when he's not present.

While hanging out with them you often are witness to some kind of scene that goes someting like this : 1, BF does someting physically challenging/brings up topic of politics/computer science and then says GF to repeat what he did/join in conversation - but it's just for show 2, she fails, as her BF's a sportsman and she's an unathletic girl/ can't contribute to conversation as it's out of her field of knowledge 3, BF makes fun of her 4, Teeehee, ihihihihihihi

And it's pretty unfomfortable to watch for the 50th time, and also a bit aggravating, as I know that my friend is a smart and capable person, but he always puts her on the spot, and asks for something he knows she can't do. I wasn't really saying anything as it didn't seem like it was in mean spirit, as he was adoring her when she put up her ""teehee"" giggling act afterwards, and she didn't seem hurt, so... OK, weird, but whatever.

But now she's starting to act like that even when she's out with just her friends, playing stupid, acting as if anything anyone said was brand new information, with an expression of wonder, and acting overly cheerful with a girly charm. She WAS not like this in the past, she always was a very upbeat person excited by interesting trivia, but she was reacting like a normal, adult person in touch with their inner child, but not as a literal child. She acts clueless in some cases when her opinion or advice is asked, just giggling and acting like she had no idea what year it was. It's seriously disturbing, and I don't know how to address this.

108276,Relationships,34ovqn,"I know this is probably a first world problem. My husband and I have been together two years, married for six months. Since we met in our mid 30s, we both came with into the relationships as homeowners.

Six years ago, I was able to buy my grandmother's house. When my grandmother passed away, my mom had the option of keeping the house or selling it. My mom knew she couldn't afford to really keep up the house and decided to sell it to pay for college and grad school for me.  While I am grateful that I was able to go to school without incurring debt, I was always heartbroken about selling the house. My grandmother was a huge influence in my life and her house holds so many great memories of her and my childhood. When I was given the chance to buy it a few years ago, I jumped on the chance. I have fixed it up, put back a lot of my grandmother's things and also made it my own. When I bought it, I assumed I would live here forever.

My husband bought his home seven years ago. He has a daughter and he hated the idea of his daughter spending half her childhood in an apartment. He bought a small, cute house in the city that we live. It's not large, but there's room for him and his daughter. I know he's very attached to the house, especially since he most of his memories of his daughter growing up in that house. He also recently told me that the house represented him becoming a real adult.

When we started dating, it was nice to have our own separate places. I helped him fix up the basement of his home, he helped me put in raised garden beds. When we started getting serious, were living mostly at my place, since my house was bigger and his daughter loved having her own bathroom at my place. When we got married, we decided to sell his place and move fully into my house. 

His daughter became fairly sick just after our wedding, and that took up most of our time. We canceled our honeymoon because he wanted to be close by, in case anything happened. He also started a new job in January that took up more his time and we rescheduled our honeymoon for March.  Things got busy and we just didn't have time to finalize anything. We've finally found some time to talk about plans for the house and now I'm getting some push back about him selling his house. I asked him if we should start looking for a realtor to sell his house and suggested we start moving a truckful of stuff every weekend so we can avoid one huge move. He admitted to me that he was having second thoughts about selling his house. He asked that I think about selling my grandmother's house, and we move into his smaller home. 

Right now, we effectively live in my house and his place is mostly storage. I'm trying to figure out the best way to deal with this problem. If push came to shove, either of us would sell our houses, because our relationship is more important than a house. But, I realize how important a home can be. And I understand that what I am asking him to do is a big deal. That house symbolizes becoming an adult and he raised his daughter there. But my house has generations of memories. 

He's away for the week and we agreed to save our talk for next week. While we communicate really well, I know there are going to be hurt feelings either way. One of us is going to lose in this and I want to minimize any possible problems. So, how do we figure out where to live? 

Some info:

* We can afford two keep both houses. Two mortgages wouldn't kill us but I'd like to be able put one mortgage payment into savings. However, my mortgage payment is bigger than his and my costs for utilities are almost double his.
* My house is about twenty minutes farther away from his daughter's school and daughter's mother. He and daughter's mom co-parent and split time with their daughter almost 50-50. 
* His house is half the size of mine. In his house, we would have to share a bathroom with his daughter. His daughter also has a larger room in my house and absolutely loves her room in my house.
* I offered to put him on the loan, or do whatever it takes so he's not legally left out in the cold if we were to divorce.
* We initially planned on taking any profit from the sale of his house and putting it towards his daughter's college fund.

31919,Relationships,1oquoj,"I apologize in advance for how long this is, I'm so, SO sorry, I'm just very frustrated with his family and it escalated a little.

We are almost 23 and 24, and he is just about done school and has a job lined up for when he is done. We will be moving into a house (that we will be renting) and overall, i think that despite being as young as we are, we have done well for ourselves in a short time. We are preparing to settle down.

First of all, I don't work because I can't. They pushed and pressured me to go to college when I wasn't ready to, then were pissed when I got cut off my student loan because my marks weren't high enough, due to my college not giving me the help I needed with my learning disability (unfortunately, there was fuck all we could do to get my funding back).

I have manic depression and generalized anxiety, to the point where I am so stressed out all the time that I am on the constant verge of an anxiety attack most days -when I'm not even doing anything or going anywhere. On top of this, I have rheumatoid arthritis and asthma, and so we're working on getting my Disability through, I definitely qualify, it's just a long process.

ANY time I say something about being bored, his mother tells me to find a job because I just might like it! and his niece (who is about 4 years younger) goes on about how she only WISHES she had time to be bored! and it's very frustrating. His family does not accept my depression and anxiety as a real thing, deeming it pure laziness and that in itself is anxiety inducing. I can't remove them from my facebook friends list because his mother will make a big stink out of it, but it's like I can't post anything anymore without her finding a way to urge me to get a job or his niece thinking I live in the lap of luxury. And yeah, I don't *have* to work because my fiance makes just enough to get by (the disability is just so my meds are covered), but this isn't how I wanted to be.

I didn't want to live like this, I didn't want to feel like this. And I didn't want my feelings and mental illnesses invalidated by a family I'm marrying into. Like they have absolutely no respect for my mental state. His sister doesn't really understand it either, but she tries really hard and doesn't beat me down because of it and has even defended me when they started talking about it when we were all together last new years.

His mother also feels she has the right to go on about whatever I'm wearing all the time. I wore a cute dress one day when we went to pick up my fiance, it was short, but still modest, and she bought me pants to put underneath it and forced me put them on! I mean I'm overweight (not obese by any means, oh my gosh no!), but I gained it equally all over so my body still has a nice shape and it's not like I have cellulite and fat rolls hanging out everywhere, maybe I'm just biased, but I looked cute in that dress, but I eventually threw it away because I couldn't handle the way she treated me in it. She also used to go on and on about how my cleavage was always hanging out of my clothes and that I shouldn't wear such low-cut shirts, and his sister looked at her and said She's wearing the same thing as I am! She's just got HUGE boobs, it isn't her fault! and his mother never said another word about them after that.

This woman is just SO FRUSTRATING. Nothing I do is ever good enough and she's always beating me down, going on about how ungrateful I am because I wouldn't take the help she tried to give me to help me succeed at first, and then failed when I did take it, but I never even WANTED it! It's just because my vision of success (getting married, having children, being happy despite having to live off disability payments) doesn't match up with the vision she has for her son (going to school until he's damn near 30, getting a job that really just pays too much, buying a house, and maybe having one child before his wife is too old to conceive). She goes on about how I'm just lazy and that the disability is like stealing from people who pay taxes because they actually WORK for their money! (as if taxes aren't paid in order to live in a civilized society, right?). She refuses to accept that even with therapy I will never be 100% okay.

She even went so far to start asking me about my birth control in the middle of her work place, then give me shit when I told her the doctor took me off it because it was causing damage! She then told me that I better not get myself pregnant before implying that her son would leave me if I did! Like what kind of woman raises her son to leave his pregnant wife? (We are not married yet, but we recognize being common law). Well it sucks to be her, because we're getting ready to start trying for a baby and she has absolutely no say in it (no one can decide for you when you are ready, but she acts like she can just direct our lives the way she wants it to go, I mean financially we're fine and emotionally we're about as ready as we're ever going to be, I know I have depression and anxiety, but I feel very different about this, and those are something I'm going to have to deal with possibly for the rest of my life, I might as well move forward with it and deal with things as they come instead of worrying so much, I can't let them stop my life and hold me back!) 

She has even made racist remarks about my being Native (I'm only a sliver Native American, but there was a genetic throwback and I am the only one who has picked up the native appearance in three generations...I stick out from the rest of my family like a sore thumb, I was teased for it relentlessly as a child so my mom had me visit the reserve often and they helped me learn about my culture and such so that I wouldn't learn to hate it so I do have a very strong connection to it). My fiance's brother in law is this large Asian man and he is all over my being Native and it's just really weird, none of them think twice about saying things like you don't drink much for a native! or calling me squaw.

Above all this, she has had the nerve to call me rude because I got frustrated and walked away from the situation to take a few minutes to calm down before returning to it once. She even told me I had no business in my fiances financial or living situation the summer we moved in together, trying to stop it from happening!

I can't even UGH. This family. It's not that I don't like them, I do like them and they're NOT bad people, they just say some shitty things sometimes and after a while it all builds up and it hurts and no matter what my fiance says to them, no matter how many times he has put his foot down over their behaviour, it doesn't change.

134533,Breakups,3df7qt,"My wife and i started dating when we were both 16, and got married at 19, which in all honesty was too young for both of us. We rushed into marriage because of me joining the military and wanting her to come with me.

When we were dating, for the first 3 years or so, we had a great sex life. granted, we were horny teenagers, but we would have sex all the time whenever we had a chance. In college we moved in together, and still had a great sex life. 

In the last few years of our marriage, our sex life has deteriorated somewhat. What was once a nearly nightly occurrence is now once or twice a week at most, with some dry spells of weeks at a time. It is not for lack of trying on my part, she just always has some excuse. We have also gotten into fights about me masturbating, which I feel as a healthy solution to me having a higher sex drive than my wife, and my wife takes it as a personal insult. 

on my first deployment, a year ago, she had moved back to our home state to be with her family whilst i was deployed. During this time I had noticed that she was acting a little strange/distant. I did some snooping (which I know is wrong) and discovered that she had been texting her ex boyfriend from 7 years ago.

When i confronted her about it, she said that they were just catching up after not hearing from each other in years. I told her that I wasnt comfortable with it, and would prefer if she ceased communications.

 A couple of weeks later, I snooped again and discovered that she again called and texted her ex. I confronted her again, asking if she was doing anything behind my back, or had anything she needed to tell me. She said that she didn't, so I asked why she had been communicating with her ex again. She backpedaled the conversation and said that she had been out drinking the night before and lost her wallet, and that he just so happened to have picked it up (small town, not entirely outside of possibilities). She had then gotten a hold of him to get it back. I told her that I felt she had violated my trust and that I was unsure if I could continue to trust her if she kept hiding things from me. 

A few weeks go by, and I again discover that she had called her ex, this time at 3 am. I got quite angry and called her. We got into a huge fight about it, and the story originally was that she was just contacting him to get a hold of one of his friends, but she then later changed her story that she contacted him hang out, and they chilled at his place, and that the friend that she wanted to get a hold of was at his house. I wasn't sure that i believed her at the time, still am unsure, but she said that she was incredibly sorry for going behind my back again, but was waiting until i return home before talking to me about it. I told her that I would not be in a relationship with someone that was going behind my back and continuing to have a relationship with their ex. She promised (again) never to talk to him. 

I returned from my deployment, everything seemed to go fine. We would fight from time to time, but it wasn't horrible. We had some great times, and some not so great.

I went on another deployment earlier this year, and it was difficult to trust that my wife wasnt doing things and talking to people behind my back, but it went fine. We talked almost daily when i was downrange, and it went by pretty quickly. 

When I returned, i got notified that i had to go to a different state for a month for a training, which is relatively normal for my job. I'm currently at that training, and my wife had again started acting distant. We would talk most nights, but she would freqently try to get off the phone with me. I have come to realize that she does this when she is hiding something from me. I snooped again and discovered that she had yet again texted her ex repeatedly on friday night at 2 in the morning. He lives in our homestate, across the country, so i know that she isnt actively cheating on me with him, but i still took it as a violation of her promise as well as my trust. 

I called her, and asked if she had anything she needed to talk about, anything that she wanted to get off her chest, and she said that she didnt. I asked if she had been doing anything behind my back, she said she wasnt. I asked her why she had talked to her ex again, and she said she couldnt tell me over the phone, that she was waiting for me to return from my training and talk to me in person. She asked me if i could wait until I got home for an answer, and I told her that i couldnt. We got into a huge fight about it, and she finally told me that she was drinking on friday, and had worked up the courage to get a hold of him to talk to his female friend to ask her some questions about some emotions that my wife has been feeling; it then comes out that my wife has been questioning her sexuality for years and is not sure if she is straight. She was trying to get a hold of her ex's friend because she had had a similar situation.

This was obviously a bit of a shock, one because I didnt see it coming, and two because she went to someone else instead of me to discuss issues in our relationship. One thing that I noticed is that she only texted her ex back and forth, no one else. I asked her about this and she said that he was with her friend was with him and she just texted the friend through her ex's phone.

We got into a huge fight, not about my wife and her questioning her sexuality. I understand that it is out of her control, but her betraying my trust for the 4th time to continue to have a relationship with her ex, whilst hiding feelings and emotions that directly impact me pushed me over the top. I told her that I didnt believe her story at all (about trying to talk to her ex's friend) and brought up the previous times that she has lied and hidden communications behind my back. 

I've been unable to sleep for the last 3 days, and I have told her that I want to get a separation and eventually a divorce. The hard part is that I obviously still have feelings for her, and she claims to still love me. I just don't know if i can ever forgive her and trust her again. 

We fortunately do not have children, but we own a house, so i'm not sure what we are going to do with that. She will probably go back to our homestate as that is where her family is, and i have to stay in this area for work. She says that she doesn't want me to continue to live in our house without her, because she cant imagine the idea of me eventually bringing someone back to our house. 

I currently plan to ask a friend if i can crash with him for a few weeks when i return,  until she has had time to figure out where she is going/who she is going to stay with.

He broke up with me about a year ago because he decided he would be wanted to pursue something with another woman and was tired of dealing with our long-standing relationship issues. It was not an amicable breakup. I occasionally see him because we live in the same city, have a bunch of mutual friends, and up until a few months ago worked in the same very large company. So there is some very minimal group interaction between us, but because of the mutual friends/coworkers I generally know what's going on in his life.

The problem is I can't stop competing with him in my mind. His successes make me unhappy and critical of my own life and his failures/problems make me feel guilt-free happiness. I feel this obsessive need to know what's going on in his life and to measure my life against his. 

I know the root issue is that he hurt me and I hope he pays for it with an unhappy life. In some respects this mindset is good because it stops me from being complacent and pushes me to keep doing better (getting a job at a better company, going back to school, making new friends, trying new things, etc.), but obviously I recognize it as a huge problem too. I know it's not healthy and intellectually I know each of our happiness/success has no bearing on the other person's.

111651,Non-Romantic,36fxmg,"My parents divorced around 10 years ago, me, my sister Anna (23F) and our two brothers stayed with our Dad whilst my little sister, Beth (18F) moved across country with our Mom.


Communication between the two halves of the family mostly ceased after the divorce due to our parents completely hating each other. A few years ago, the two sides began talking to each other again (except our parents, who refused to talk to each other).


A week ago, Beth had came down for a visit for the first time since the divorce.


A little background on my relationship with my sisters, as children they would always gang up on me, leave me out and bully me. I had never done anything to them and was always nice. However, they only behaved this way when they were together. If I spent time with Beth or Anna on their own, they were completely fine and I actually enjoyed spending time with them. 


Anna and I still lived with our father. Anna currently works and is saving up for a place of her own and I am studying at university and work part time. Our eldest brother, Mark [26] has lived abroad  for the past 3 years and our other brother John [25] lives 2 hours away and has done since he left to be close to his university, so it's just been me and my sister living with our Dad.


After the divorce, my relationship with my elder sister improved and she has been mostly pleasant to me (she can be a bit rude and unpleasant at times but we've been mostly good, no major drama).


My little sister is now one week into her 2 and a half week visit. The plan for her visit was that I would take off the first week from work/ going to lectures and a few days off in the following week and a half to spend time with Beth when no one else could and Anna would continue with her work shedule as normal (she works a few days a week with variances in hours).


The first few days with Beth we fine, I took her wherever she wanted to go, brought her a few things she couldn't afford herself and we've had a great time together and she was nothing but wonderful to me the entire time and we got on well. Then everything changed the first day off work Anna got. 


They started behaving like they did when we were children. They left me out again and would leave without telling me where they were going or asking me to join them, they began accusing me about lying about stupid stuff (For example, they said I lied about what I had for lunch. For some reasoning it was unbelievable that I would eat a sandwich), they would criticse me for everything, even things they've done themselves and would whisper and bitch about me behind my back. They've been thoroughly unpleasant, rude and vile to me for the past two days, and, just like when we were kids, I've done nothing to them to warrant that behaviour. 


At this point I've decided that I'm done with them, especially Anna, who I've done so much for since the divorce. When Beth returns home, Anna is gonna pretend like the past week never occurred and start being nice to me again (she can't stand being on her own and has a small handful of very shitty friends so I'll be the only one she really has) and I'm just gonna tell her to leave me alone and that our relationship is done. I can't stand being around her anymore and I'm definatley not going to be her support system anymore as all she's done to me in the past few days has made me cry more than I've done since I was child. 


Beth and I rarely talked before her visit (a few times a month, exactly the same amount that she talks to the rest of our siblings, including Anna) so our relationship will probably just drop back down to that. 


Now, on to the pressing issue. Thursday, Anna goes back to work all day, so I'm stuck with Beth. I have to spend the entire day with her and I just don't want to. You are probably asking why don't I just refuse. Well, I can't. If I do, my dad with be pissed off at me  and the last thing I want to do is piss of the man whose house I live in rent free. So I have to spend the day with her. Beth is probably gonna go back to being pleasant to me but I can't go back to a few days ago when I actually liked being with her.  Futhermore, there's going to be a few more days where it's just me and Beth and I'm not sure how I'm going to cope. 


I've spoken to John about this, he know how awful Anna and Beth can be to me when they're together and he's taking time off next week to come visit so that I won't be alone against Anna and Beth and so I don't have to spend time alone with Beth. But in the mean time, I am pretty much by myself. 


My questions is, how do I spend Thursday and the other days alone with Beth? Do I pretend everything is normal? Do I act indifferent to her? Do I confront her? Do I tell her to fuck off and spend time with someone she doesn't treat like a piece of shit?


The last three options I know are going to give my issues from either my siblings and/ or my Dad. 


If Anna and Beth are going to give me shit anyway, should I make any effort to be nice to them at all during Beth's visit? Should I just pretend everything is okay during the visit? So far I've been pretending everything's okay when I'm one on one with Beth (I'm not sure I can handle this much longer, their behaviour is getting worst), staying away from them when they're together and being mostly cordial to them when they seek me out.

Any advice and suggestions would be great. Sorry for any grammatical/ spelling mistakes and the amount of text.

71594,Non-Romantic,1qplbc,"Of course, I will elaborate.  I've known her for a year, and I count her as one of my closest friends in the world.  She and I have a fantastic relationship, both at work and outside of work.

About a month ago, she had a drunken encounter with the other coworker, and since then they have met up a few more times for casual encounters.  They are not in a relationship, per se, but are more like friends with benefits.

A few days ago, she became very distant at work, and was crying while confiding something to another coworker [34F] (someone else she is very close to).  After she left work, I asked the other coworker what was wrong, and she told me I should talk to her.

I did, and she confessed that she had a thing with the 21-year-old coworker, which is something I had my suspicions about over the last month.  But I found out the reason she was crying is because she was talking to the other coworker (the 34 Y/O) about how it would affect the relationship between her and I.

And it turned out that she was afraid to tell me because, she suspected, I had feelings for her based on how I acted and how I talked to her.  And I told her that, yes, I do.  I won't lie: I've wanted to tell her for the longest time that I liked her, but I guess these things come out when they do and not when we want them to.

She also made it known that I was the person who she trusted more than anyone else on Earth, which struck me.  It turned out we both kept from saying these things to each other because we didn't want to hurt each other, or complicate the friendship we do have.

I may not like it, but I'm not in high school, and I can accept unrequited limerence on my part.  I even told her that, while I can't change the way that I feel about her, I'll just have to live with whatever choices she makes.  I'm an adult.

What affects me is that she, a person who has trust issues with people (as am I), has come to trust me so much that she was afraid that she was lying to me and that her fling with the coworker would damage our relationship.  I never want her to think that I would reject her as a person.  And I would never force her to think she has to be in a romantic relationship with me.

And there is this persistent question in my head if she likes me back, based on things she has said to me and about me.  She isn't required to be into me for me to want to be around her, but sometimes I wonder.  She's never been explicit, obviously, about whether or not she is into me.

Okay, so I guess my question is: how do I handle this?  I've never been in this situation before.  How do I deal with being the reason that someone else, someone who I respect and have feelings for, broke down and cried, someone who trusts me more than anyone?  How do I handle being an emotional pillar in someone else's life?

So I was like alright sure but you're gonna have to not see other guys while you figure out what you want. because i'm not gonna be sloppy seconds and shit, i'm just not comfortable with that.

Except for one thing. She's an attention whore. I wouldn't go so far as to call her a slut but she's pretty addicted to it. She's flirted with other guys while sitting right across the room from me, and then brushed it off later when I brought it up because she wasn't really interested in them and her brain was still in single mode and she was drunk. She's put her feet up on some other dude's thighs **while cuddling with me.**

She's asked me if she can make out with other girls, because it's harmless and it would give her some freedom.

I'm already giving her the benefit of the doubt being best friends with her ex (who she's still not over, her words, not mine). I've met the guy and he is a very genuine guy, I know they're not fucking or anything like that, he's just a very important support pillar in her life and I've come to terms with that.

She keeps telling me she's different when she's in a relationship and she's just trying to give her brain time to want a relationship and get out of single mode. Does that actually ever happen? Can an attention whore magically become a committed and stable partner?

66958,Infidelity,2j1qv9,"I had a lot to drink last night and had severe memory loss, but I've pieced together what happened through my brother who was sober. 

My SO couldn't make it, but I was out with a group of close knit friends. There were two women there who are friends of a friend. I had met them both once before, let's call them Eve and Mary. The last time I went out with this group was months ago and I met Eve for the first time. She was very flirtatious with me and I found out she was trying to hook up with me but knew I had a girlfriend. I had met Mary a few weeks ago, with no notable occurrences. 

Last night I was probably more drunk than I had ever been before. My brother had told me that Eve told him during the night that she had made out with me. I have no recollection of this, but I'm not sure why she would lie and since she tried hooking up with me last time, I believe it. The group we were with had a large amount of lesbians / bisexuals and mass hook ups have occurred before. Everyone started hooking up with each other which is probably around the same time I hooked up with Eve. 

Apparently Mary was being pretty flirtatious all night with guys, including me. On the cab ride home, we sat in the back seat. I was on the middle and oddly enough, my friend Steve was to my right. He and Mary had hooked up previously. Mary and I were apparently getting touchy and feely and my hand ended up in the back of her pants with a finger in her ass. I may have groped her breast as well. 

I woke up this morning and am currently having the worst day of my life. I told my GF everything. I feel terrible about it. It's out of my character to do anything like this. I'm naturally a pretty friendly and touchy  feely (respectfully) guy, but I hold my moral character in high regard. I'd never do anything to hurt my GF, let's call her Jan, but last night was obviously an exception. 

Jan and I have been dating for nearly three years. We're a mixed race / religion couple so her family doesn't know about me, minus her siblings. She's not able to stay the night or stay out past 8/9PM, which makes things very difficult. Our relationship blossomed because she was away at college with more freedom, but now we've been struggling a little since she's finishing up school at home and back under the rule of her parents. 

I don't know what could have possessed me to do the things that I did. I love Jan more than anything. Again, I was completely obliterated from drinking and don't remember much. I realize that's no justification for what I did. I usually still have a moral compass when I'm drunk. I called Jan last night to say that people were making out and groping eachother and that I love her and I wouldn't do anything. I'm not particularly attracted to Eve or Mary. This is the worst thing I've ever done. 

Hanging out with Jan can be complicated since she has to constantly lie to her parents. She's finishing up school soon, but she doesn't have any plans to move out soon.  Every time I go out, I have to answer the question, Where's Jan? It's frustrating because she can't be around after 9PM or stay overnight anywhere. She hasn't connected much with my friends or family because she's been away at school and is usually pretty busy. This has caused our relationship to be a little rocky. I feel so alone because I have to do so much without her, and when she does come out I know she has to lie to her parents. 

I want to be a part of her family, but she doesn't want to tell them about me until we're ready to get married. 

This frustration has led me to reconsider whether or not I want to be in the relationship over the past few months. Finding someone without these complications would be much easier, but I don't want to do that. 

She's willing to forgive me, but our complications and now this event has caused us to seriously reconsider the relationship. I still love her and want to be with her. I understand the difficulties of our relationship and am willing to continue.

I am disgusted with myself and regret my actions completely. 

TL;DR: I fooled around with two women last night. I told my 23F SO everything. We're a mixed religion couple of three years who have been having some struggles. We're now reconsidering our relationship. 

EDIT: Her and her family are Muslim. They don't exactly approve of dating, which is why she can't tell her parents. It's not worth the headache. She does have non-Muslims in her family and they're accepted. It just takes some time to be a part of the family.

We have fun with each other, talk about the future, have sex regularly (6-10/wk), and don't fight often. When we do fight, we get the big emotions out of the way then talk it out and we are happy again. 

Now background on me. I've had shit luck with men in the past. Most have cheated on me. I don't really carry that into relationships, but I'm aware of behaviors that are suspicious. I would never go through some ones phone or email.

So here's my issue. Since we've been dating, he won't let me near his phone. If I'm using it, he's hovering. I have a habit of noticing peoples passkeys.. I'm not trying to snoop but i see it in the corner of my eye our something and i remember it. Sometimes I don't even realize I notice it. I'll have their phone and just do the key. I did that to his phone. Next day it changed. Month later I needed to order pizza and my phone was dead so I used his, with him next to me but I unlocked it. Next day it changed. When ever he realizes I know it, he changes it. Last night I noticed he not only changed it, but also made it so the key won't show up. I'm not peering over his shoulders every time he unlocks his phone. I'll be sitting next to him on the couch or something and he'll randomly pull his phone out to check something and I'll notice the movement and look.

So am I just over reacting? It just kind of worries me. He knows my passwords and pass keys. Its not like I'm looking through his phone. He shows no sign of cheating. I just think it's weird that he is extremely protective of his phone. I have talked to him about it a few months back and he shrugged it off saying that I was over reacting and he just doesn't like people looking at his phone.

I feel like the little raft of me in the ocean of life has been smashed into jagged pieces, which now only serve to cut me as I try to piece them back together. I’m drowning in these churning and monstrous waves of emotion. These cruel waves feel never ending. This deep and overpowering feeling of love I have for her is now meaningless. I try to let the feelings go, but they always seem to come back and smother me.


Thoughts of her drift through my mind. It all started with our first date. We spent nine blissful hours together, and we had our first tender kiss. That electrifying feeling of kissing her lips, I can’t get it out of my head. No matter when it was during our relationship, kissing her was like being whisked away into another reality. The connection and current between us in those moments when our lips touched, it was like a kaleidoscope of colors all exploding and morphing, entangled in joy.


It's only me in this big house now. Yet I still have visions of her singing and dancing to music in the living room, sitting at the dining room table painting, or curling up on the couch under a blanket to watch a TV show. I can see the smile on her face, the warmth and love in her eyes when she looked at me with those vibrant blue eyes of hers. She had an aura about her that would just envelop me and make me feel like I was the luckiest man in the world.


It wasn't always sunshine and happiness obviously. That's part of life and relationships. Nevertheless, the bad times pale when I look at the entire story of our relationship. I can vividly see the potential we had together. I never gave up through it all. I fought for her heart and mind. But, now she’s gone from my life. It’s as if she died, and the one person I want to share my vulnerability and heartache with, to reach out for solace, is gone.


Now this longing of my heart, to connect with the woman I love, will forevermore be lost at sea.

Last night, we were doing our usual weekly meetup of hanging out and sleeping together, when he told me that he's now having another sexual relationship going on with another girl. I appreciated his honesty and didn't think much of it, until he said ""I'll just let you know if it starts to become something serious"". 



So now, do I even bother with this guy anymore? I enjoy the sex, and am 100% sure that we are strictly friends with benefits, nothing more, but after him saying that, I'm feeling less enthusiastic about continuing to mess around with him. Now, to me, there seems to be some underlying expiration date to it all. What do you think I should do?

31978,Relationships,2me639,"Sorry in advance this turned out longer than expected.

Okay so I [20M] met my girlfriend (Ashley) [18F] during frosh week and things have progressed really smoothly since. We have now been dating for 3 months. I can honestly say we're the happiest we've both ever been in a relationship. Ashley also met Mack [18M] during frosh and they quickly became close friends. Mack is currently dating Lucy [21F] a foreign exchange student from Spain and they have been together for around 2 and a half months.  

At this point, I feel like it's necessary for me to say that I am not concerned that Ashley is interested in Mack, or that they are crossing any boundaries. Mack has even asked me if I was comfortable with their friendship, and shows me a great deal of respect.

However, I've noticed that when we all hang out together (since we are all part of the same friend group) Mack seems to make her laugh harder and seems to have more interesting things to say.

Whenever Mack and Lucy are out together they get multiple compliments on how cute they are, how lucky they are to have each other or how well they work as a couple. (Which is true, since they are both very extroverted and very fun people to be around).

However, I am more introverted in nature and am starting to believe that it bothers Ashley. 

Our only issue as a couple is that I have a hard time showing my affection and that I get more quiet when we are in a larger group. 

Anyways, I am starting to worry that Ashley is mentally comparing me to Mack and our relationship to his and Lucy's. I am a more serious studious type, while he is a charismatic free spirit and so I worry that since Ashley is also more extroverted/free spirit that I will come up looking worse.

For example, recently we were all at this local bar on the weekend and a drunk guy started hitting on Ashley, and I just laughed it off having complete faith in her. Afterwards she told me she would have appreciated if I intervened because it shows that I care about her and when I don't she feels neglected. Which is all true, I just feel awkward in those situations and never know what to do.  
Well later in the night another drunk guy starts hitting on Lucy, and Mack quickly intervenes and diffuses the situation and by the time it's over somehow the drunk guy is buying Mack and Lucy a drink, complimenting Mack and telling everyone how wonderful they are as a couple, with most people at the bar agreeing. After seeing that I looked over to Ashley and she gave me this half disappointed look and I couldn't help but feel like she wishes she had been in Lucy's position. 

And recently I have been noticing it more and more for little things, like a few nights ago Mack Ashley Me and a few others were going to smoke some weed (Lucy doesn't smoke) and I rolled a pretty bad joint. After seeing it someone in the group said Hey pass it to Mack he's the yung doctor when it comes to joints'' and I just felt almost emasculated in front of Ashley.

The main issue is Mack himself never does anything to challenge me he's just simply being Mack, showing his girlfriend hella love and doing his own thing. So it's not like I can ask him to quit showing me up since he's actually a pretty humble guy who actually looks out for me a fair bit (telling people interesting things about me when I'm too shy to speak, letting me know if someone is trying to hit on Ashley, helping Ashley find me when her phone dies ect...). 

My girlfriend frequently makes comments like : isn't it cool how Mack and Lucy do this, 
Or how she loves how much Mack knows about Hip-Hop (a genre I don't love)

And just yesterday (sort of the reason for this post) Ashley said something along the lines of Why don't you dress a little more like Mack which shows to me that she does in fact mentally compare me to him, I'm not tripping out. Later that day she saw a picture on Instagram of Mack and Lucy and she mentioned how they were such a perfect couple, and then commented #powercouple (which in fairness they kind of are) but that made my heart sink because I don't think she views our relationship that way.

So how do I deal with these feelings of inadequacy ?
And how to I get myself to not be compared to Mack? 

TL;DR; My girlfriends best friend is outshining me and I need to know how to cope, and how to shine brighter.

Novel time.

I (35m) met a very nice and attractive woman (28F) last fall, let's call her Rachel, and she showed immense interest in me.  We started talking quite a bit, and it became clear she was romantically interested.  She was also very supportive and compassionate.  I explained that I really appreciated her support, but I was not emotionally available.  In fact, I was a mess.  I was recently separated and going through a divorce (2 young children).  She said she understood, and backed off romantically, but was still a very strong presence in my life.  I told her everything.  She told me everything.  She... subtly continued in her romantic pursuit of me. 

Cut forward a few weeks to rationalizations that we could just 'have fun' and keep each other company without commitment, to which I thought, that sounds like a good idea. (Yes, I know.  I should also mention that she was a few month's out of a LTR herself.)  She was extremely... forward with me, and once I gave a hint of a green light, she was go.  

The ground rules were laid, and 'no expectations' was the phrase of the day.  Of course, this didn't work very well, and a couple weeks in, she told me that she couldn't handle 'no expectations'.  Not a big surprise, but sooner than I expected.  We decided that maybe we needed to take a break for several months, while I pulled myself together, and would see about legitimately dating afterward.  I liked her quite a bit, but I wanted to be sure that things were... not purely circumstance-based on either side (coughreboundcough).

The hold didn't last long.  Within a week, we were back to... dating?  Quasi-dating? ... Having fun.  At any point, I realized that I was going to either have to pull myself together or watch the beginnings of a relationship with Rachel, a fantastic catch, come to an abrupt end.  This 'fun' crap never works.  I told Rachel that while I still had some baggage to sort out, I was confident that I could exclusively date her.  We agreed to have a... non-serious but exclusive relationship.  (Yes, I know.)  

I was confident that I didn't want to date anyone else, so this was good with me.  No, I didn't act out of obligation, because there was certainly some great chemistry and LTR potential.  Timing might be a bitch that must be respected at times, but I won't let it constantly run my life.  

It was great.  We were highly communicative, supported each other through some heavy stuff, and had a great time with each other.  I was using some hard-learned lessons from my past in developing what I thought was a healthy relationship.  I had motivation to be a better person, and I was making progress.  She helped me grow.  I hoped that I was helping her, too.

About a month later, Rachel tells me that she loves me, introduces me to her family, and things were getting very (and wonderfully) intense.  She was, however, very very upset when I didn't respond with ""I love you, too.""  I told her that I wasn't ready to say that, but that I felt very strongly for her, and thought we were moving in a positive direction.  

I said I just needed time and to heal a little more.  By this point, it had been a couple months since we had met.  We seemed to get past it afterward, although she would occasionally (and sadly) bring it when she felt down.  We worked through it.  I legitimately worked on myself as to being a better partner in mind.  

Fast forward another month - I feel great about things, I feel confident that I'm not going to get my heart smashed - I finally feel kind of back on my feet again.  I'm confident, for the first time in a long time.  In myself.  In a potential future with Rachel.  I felt loved.  

I tell her ""I love you"" back.  It was to be a grand moment for us (I'm a bit of a romantic), maybe followed with a passionate kiss, smiles, crazy sex, and whatever else.  We'd be on equal footing, finally, and she could feel from me what I had felt from her.

Reality check: She says, ""no, you don't.""  :(  Well, shit.  Within hours, I overhear her explaining who I am to her friend that our group runs into: ""Oh, he's just some guy that I'm sort of seeing.  He's annoying and getting on my nerves.""  She turns around and sees me.  I'm speechless and absolutely ripped apart inside.  I flat out leave and go home.  Please adjust your seats to their full and upright positions, we've just hit some serious turbulence. 

Rachel is not without her self defense mechanisms, and I eventually chalked this response up to that, although it was still VERY painful to experience.  We again worked through it, but after that night, nothing was the same.  

The cute texts from her stopped.  The expressed concern and care about what was happening with me waned, and she didn't even look at me with 'that look' in her eyes anymore.  I was very hurt and extremely confused.  And my newly gained confidence was certainly getting put in check.  I opened myself up, and was shut the fuck down.  I was told that I was moving too fast. This coming from a woman who over a month prior had said she loved me and thought I could be ""the one"".

Rachel sometimes assures me that this was only because she's not used to being treated well by a guy and doesn't know how to respond.  That she's freaked out.  But, she would also occasionally give other excuses: we can't be serious until the divorce is final (very reasonable, but I worry that's just a convenient excuse.  It didn't stop her from pursuing me or saying 'I love you' early on, and only became this serious of an issue after I said 'I love you'  And at this point, the divorce is 'done' - we just have a waiting period until final judgment is allowed).  

Another reason is I'm too 'intense' in expressing my feelings for her - literally, in the way I might look at her and smile.  It makes her self-conscious.  I've actually worked at curtailing SHOWING AFFECTION by actively trying not to LOOK AT HER AND SMILE or SAY THINGS, LIKE ""YOU'RE GORGEOUS"".  And no, I'm not a creepy guy.

She has since apologized for saying ""I love you"" and having me meet her family.  She seems to expect that I can just forget it happened and throw this switch off.  I was already planning on introducing her to my parents, about having her meet my kids down the road.  I didn't want her to be sorry.  I wanted her to feel good that she did it.  But that's where I'm at.  And where I rank, apparently.  As a mistake.

She cried and pleaded, and wanted me to reach a point that I could open my heart to her.  She made cracks at times about how I didn't love her too...  When I finally got there, she freaked and pushed me away.  I feared that she realized she didn't really want me, which I told her.  She told me that I'm wrong; rather, I'm too pushy and annoying.  (Ironically, one of the things I'm pushy about is finding out what she exactly needs from the relationship because I don't want to bother her.)  Big fight ensues.  

I finally hit my limit.  A week ago, after being called annoying again, I tell her never to contact me again, and I put up a wall to keep her away.  I feel like an absolute fool for falling for her.  This shit doesn't happen to me - it's just too good to be true, and I should have recognized that from the start.  I made it very clear that this was not healthy for me, and I needed it to stop immediately.  ""I would prefer you not reply at all"", I think this was in the last message I had sent her.

The last few days: She tried reaching out to me a couple times, and I finally responded to an email pleading to let her explain some things to me.  That she loves me very much.  I reluctantly told her that we could meet, but that I am in a bad place and not looking to be in a worse one.  That's tomorrow.  Assuming she shows.

Another caveat here is her unreliability.  She's always late.  I've been stood up by her a number of times.  I've waited for hours only to have her call, say how she lost track of time, and then wait hours past the ""new"" meet time (two of these times I was cooking a fantastic dinner).  Even promises that she won't be late on the makeup for being late - and then she's late.  I'm talking hours, not just 15 minutes.  Between her unreliability and emotional distance (since I returned the ""i love you""), it made things excruciatingly difficult to even have a conversation with her more than once a week.  

I felt guilty for pressuring her, for prying, and being annoying.  So, instead, I tried leaving her alone completely in between the times she scheduled in for us.  That was kind of OK, except that she would often cancel and/or reschedule at the last minute - or late.  I was, again, feeling very unimportant.  Back burner stuff.

I just feel like it's a big risk to meet her again.  I've been shattered again, and feel about as bad as I did when I first separated from my ex.  The nature of my relationship with Rachel lately has been stressful and painful, with much worrying and fretting on my part.  Lots of waiting and wondering.  I have felt like a doormat at times.

If I do follow through and meet her, should I even bother to feel out if I think she's legit interested anymore? Or should I just shut down from the start and make it clear that this relationship has taken a very ugly turn from my perspective? Again, I've already explained my feelings to her about the rejection, the distance, the unreliability multiple times.  Most times, the cause turns out to be something that I did, or my lack of understanding of her issues.

If I ever show pain or frustration, she quickly points out that she doesn't know how to handle a relationship with someone that doesn't treat her like shit, and doesn't believe she deserves one, or that someone could really love her.  So, she says, she tries to push me away in response.  

I'll give this to her - that method has worked fantastically, because she pushed me the hell away, hard.  I wish her conscious mind had as much conviction to show up to an important date on time as her unconscious mind has when pulling shit like, ""no, you don't love me"" and ""why are you so pushy?"".  I think back to my patience and understanding when she told me she loved me so soon and wanted to hear it back.  When she wanted me to meet her family.  That shit's intense.  And I handled it well, so I thought.

I'm really questioning cancelling this meetup with her.  It's tomorrow night, redditors.  I don't know that seeing her is going to help me with anything.  She's prepared to give me a 'no, don't think bad of yourself, you're a great and amazing guy, i love you so much' speech.  Where it ends, I don't know.  

What do you think, should listen to what she has to say?  And yes, I still love her very much.  I would love to be with her.  I'm just trying to be realistic and objective here.  If she's late this time, though, I'm damn sure I'm never fucking talking to her again.
   
tl;dr: She pushed hard, I reciprocated after much careful deliberation. Was rejected, told I am pushy and annoying - she distances herself hard.  I cut off the relationship, extremely hurt.  Less than a week later, she pushes to meet up and explain her feelings.

58623,Relationships,2g3oev,"First let me tell you a little bit about our relationship. We have been together for 3 years and have had ups and downs but we love each other very much. We both discussed a future together and I mostly thought things were good. We live separately for financial reasons (I have a lot of student loans still and he only works part time currently), but we both wanted to move in when the time was right for both of us. Up until a couple of days ago I thought we were happy.

On Monday he told me he wasn't happy and he wasn't sure why and he had some soul searching to do. I was upset because this felt like it was coming from no where, but I tried to give him space to think. Yesterday he told me that he realized he is codependent on me. At first I disagreed because I felt like in a lot of ways we live separate lives and he doesn't live and breath through me. But now I am starting to understand more. He said his happiness is tied to mine, when I am unhappy for any reason he blames himself. He said he is realizing he was codependent in his last relationship and he thrived when he was single.

I asked what this meant for us and he said he didn't know. He doesn't know if this is something he needs to be alone to work on or if we can get through it together. I told him to think about it and we could talk this weekend if he was ready, so I am just waiting and confused about the whole thing.

122591,Dating,1pk83s,"Hey guys! At the beginning of the school year I took a liking to my lab partner and we began to hit it off almost instantly. I got her number and she would text me to initiate conversation and I would do the same. We would walk from class, had inside, jokes, constantly playfully touched in lab (pretty much our legs were always in contact. I invited her for some food after class and we went and had a great time. Than she invited me for smoothies and we went and had another great time. Honestly things could not be going any better. Textbook boy likes girl and the other way around. Than she changed out of nowhere. She would not respond to my texts and she just seemed like she didn't want to talk to me as much as before. Stopped responding to texts one in a while, never initiated converstations via text, and when we were in lab she just never seemed interested in the conversation and pretty much did a complete 360. I shrugged it off and thought she found someone else and proceeded to start meeting other people. However, it started to go back to its old ways of us talking, but not over text, only in person. what i mean is that she still never initiated conversation and seldomly responded and if she did it was a short response. In class we were the same as before but outside of it we were still in the complete 360. I stopped talking to her for about a week since we didnt have lab and I never texted her. After that week we have a test coming up and I go to extra lab hours to study. People leave as time goes on, but I notice how it was just me and her at the end and we started talking again. It turned into the deepest conversation I ever had with the girl. She talked about how pretty much she wasnt over her ex, wasn't confident in her looks, and felt that she was depressed. I recently was depressed and gave m experience and it cheered her up a bit, but I told her to go seek advice. She proceeded to tell me that only her best friend and I new about this which made me feel good because she had confidence that I could keep a secret. I got the vibe that she said these things because she wanted to go further with me but was just in a bad spot at the time. However, I asked her if she was going to this Halloween party and she said she was. She asked if I was and looked pretty excited when I told her I was. We proceeded to walk together away from lab and when it was time to go our separate ways she kept talking, but her body language made it seem as if she didn't want to leave. She kept asking me questions and tried to keep the conversation going. Finally we went our seperate ways and I shot her a text 15 minutes later saying if she ever needed anything I was there for her and she said she was thankful . So my question is should I persue a relationship with this girl or does she see me as a good friend?

185041,Non-Romantic,31i44n,"I (24F) have been with my partner (25M) for 1 year. At New Years we got engaged and were so happy. We have a wonderful relationship and everything seemed to be falling in to place like a fairytale. He gets along really well with my mum, and I get along really well with his mum.

Unfortunately my partner (we shall call him Mark) has a older brother (26M, we shall call him Rick) who has a girlfriend (26F, to be known as Penny) who, a month ago, cornered Mark and basically told him he was making a terrible mistake by getting engaged to me, and questioned whether he had thought it through. Why? Here are their reasons.

**1)** Mark should have asked Rick for “brotherly guidance” and “permission” before getting engaged because Rick is the older brother and has more experience with women. They seem to think it was “disrespectful” to get engaged without letting Rick know first.

**2)** Rick and Penny have been dating for 2 years. We have only been dating for 1 year. They are acting as if they should get the privilege of getting engaged first. (note: they are always on the verge of breaking up, constantly fight, and have no intention of getting engaged any time soon)

**3)** I currently have not got a job. I was employed full time for 8 years, starting at the age of 15. I had to stop working for a while due to medical issues. They say Mark is getting taking advantage of financially, even though I am on a pension and pay bills and rent, not to mention doing 100% of the washing, cleaning, ironing, cooking and laundry.

**4)** We moved in together before they did. They currently live apart because Penny’s family are very strict Christians (EDIT: Pentecostals) (think of the Duggar family and you’re pretty close). But we are living together before they are and therefore we are disrespecting them.

**5)** Penny said that she “gets the feeling that I do not like her”. This is 100% true. I don’t like her at all. But I have tried to keep this to myself as much as possible so as not to rock the boat or cause friction. I didn't want to upset Mark, or his brother. I tried to believe she wasn’t unlikable, or that I had misinterpreted it, but after 12 months of continuous bitchiness, I don’t think this is the case. 

Here are some reasons why I dislike Penny.

**A)** She has continuously made comments about my weight. I’m not skinny. *But neither is she!* Yet she seems to think that it’s OK to make comments about what I eat and what I wear. She even made comparisons between me and Mark and Rick’s mother who is large. Not only is this insulting to me, but it’s insulting to their mother, who I get along with very well.

**B)** She comes from a giant, very strict Pentecostal family. She basically believes that divorce is evil, and because my parents are divorced, I get the impression that she sees me as less of a person. Mark and Rick’s parents are also divorced, and she has voiced her opinion to them as well. She said that it was their mothers duty to do what her husband says and to keep the family together. Never mind why they divorced. That’s her view.

**C)** She also has 8 sisters and a brother. I am an only child. She told me that only children are “mentally under developed” because they don’t get the same “mental stimulation”.

**D)** Before even meeting me, she went on to Mark’s Facebook and looked through my photos, and in front of Mark, called me  “ugly” and made ""ew! gross!"" comments, then told him to stop dating me.

**E)** Whenever I see Mark’s family for lunch or afternoon tea I bring a plate of something. I think it’s good manners. If I am going somewhere for a meal, I think it’s polite to bring something along to share. Penny has made several comments about me “trying too hard” and “trying to outdo” her.

**F)** As I like cooking, Mark’s mum kindly bought me a special type of cake tin that I was searching for which you can change the shape of, for Christmas. She bought Penny a carry on luggage bag for when she visits Rick who is currently working interstate (they visit each other once a fortnight). Penny said to me “isn’t it just faaabulous how she knows us both just sooo well? Me, a free spirit who is going on adventures. And you, who stays at home all day and…eats.” Enough said, really.

**G)** She talked in a baby voice. All. The. Time. It’s not anything she does against me, but it annoys the bejesus out of me.

Rick likes to pull the “brothers honour” card and say that as an older brother he should do things first and be in charge. I think this is ridiculous as they are a year apart and their lives and where they want to go in life is completely different to one another.  Mark is very passive and pretty much does whatever people tell him to do because he doesn’t want to cause a stir or offend people. He’s a very kind and easy going person, which I love, but at times he is too easy going to the point where he gets pushed around and taken advantage of, and I feel like they know this and are using it to their advantage.

Mark and Rick’s mother is lovely, and I get along with her really well. She is in a tough position because it’s her two sons fighting and she has to be careful not to look like she’s ganging up on one or the other. She said she can’t commit to taking sides, which I totally agree with, but she is basically 100% on our side, off the record. Penny has said a lot of nasty things to her as well, so she is not unaware of the sort of person she is.


After cornering Mark and telling him everything that I mentioned above, Mark came home to me understandably very upset. When he came home and told me what had happened I was furious and hurt. I was so angry that they had behaved like that, and so angry because of how upset Mark was.

It has been a month and they seem to think they did everything right and are totally blameless. Mark has spoken on the phone with his brother and it has ended in arguments.

I have had zero contact with them, and if I had my way it would remain this way. I have lost all respect for the both of them and I have no desire to have them around.
Unfortunately, it is Mark’s brother, and he feels we need to sort things out with them.

So, this Easter weekend we have planned to catch up with them to talk about how it made us feel and why they have over stepped the boundaries. We are apparently seeing them tomorrow, and I feel sick to my stomach about it all.


I know that Mark keeps telling me that he is 100% on my side and supporting me, but it doesn’t always feel that way because even though they've been so hurtful and nasty, he is trying too hard to be chummy with them when they do speak. To me this is making them think they've behaved correctly, and that me being upset is all my fault and that I’m over reacting. I feel like he wants to bury his head in the sand and pretend nothing has happened, but I just cannot do that.
I am scared that when we meet them I will be a sitting duck and get attacked by them, and anything I say about how I feel will be shot down, while Mark sits there and says nothing to support me because he doesn’t want to get in to an argument. I don't want to get in to an argument either, but it seems almost unavoidable.

What can I say when we see them tomorrow? I feel like everything just whirls around in my head and I can’t straighten any of it out.
I don’t believe that I will ever feel comfortable around them, or want them over in our home.
Can anyone give me a different perspective?
Sorry for the rambling.


**TL;DR:** Fiance’s brother and his girlfriend have told him that we are making the wrong decision getting engaged, that we should have asked for their permission and guidance, and that it is somehow disrespecting their relationship. I cannot stand the girlfriend as she is horrible to me at every opportunity. We are meeting them tomorrow to tell them how we feel.

121196,Infidelity,39sdtp,"I would like to just start by saying that we've dated for 7 years and just got engaged 6 months ago. Also that I read that this is more common for women to do than physically cheating. Never really understood how this was a thing until tonight.   

My Fiancee and I have had some pretty severe issues in the past. I cheated on her three years ago.   The way it happened was I broke up with her and she asked me to give it another shot and I agreed. A week later it wasn't working out and broke up with her again. She begged for one more chance. I loved her but we were just not getting along and it seemed we were always fighting and it was a struggle to get along. I broke up with her again  but wasn't moved out yet and I slept with someone else while she was away. We ended up getting back together about 5 months later. Even though I told her I was done with our relationship I wasn't moved out yet and should have waited. I denied that this was cheating at first but it's just semantics. I knew she still was madly in love with me and did something I knew would hurt her so that it'd be easier to move on and this was a pussy move. So I take responsibility for that. In addition I lied a ton to her face.

If I hadn't got back with her and moved in and had no interest I probably would've not cared. But since we did get back together I needed to acknowledge that I broke the trust by lying to her and hurting her. I have worked very very hard over the past three years to gain her trust. It has not been  easy. 

Anyways, fast forward to current time. We still get in fights somewhat often but they are small fights. They happen every 2-3 weeks and get resolved usually in a couple hours. I thought the relationship was doing well as a whole, besides those petty fights. We got engaged, have a date set, have a plan to have kids once I graduate next year, etc. 

I found out she was talking to this dude because my phone got shut off for late payment and to save money we have just been using hers. This weird number texted her late at night a while back and I asked her who it was. It turned out to be some guy she met at her sisters wedding (this is where she was when I mentioned she went away) three years prior. She assured me it wasn't a big deal and that he got her number from her sister and that he texted her and she was just trying to be nice. 

So she said she wouldn't talk to him again. We have a shared computer and I was getting onto it one day and she had left her Facebook up. As I was sitting there there was an update from that same dude. I didn't even know they were friends. But I checked and they were friends in fact friends. Not only that but neither her sister or brother in law (who invited him to the wedding)  were friends with him on facebook. I checked her inbox and she had incriminating messages. But there were big gaps in between like she deleted it to hide stuff.  But the texts that were showing indicated that they were talking about emotional and sexual things like him replying to no message prior and saying ""ya I'd like that, only if I lived there and could get you alone in my bed"". Stuff like that but worse. 

I confronted her again and she lied saying she added him because he friend requested her because he was friends with her brother in law and sister. I told her I knew about the messages and that she was lying about him being friends with he sister and brother in law and she started crying and apologized and lied more. To show ""she didn't like him"" she told him off via Facebook message and deleted him from her friends. I didn't know it at the time but based on the fact they continued to talk im sure she messaged him after and apologized. 

Anyways fast forward to today and I was using her phone again. I pull up the messages and I see a text from just a number. No contact. It was a message that was responding to one she had sent but was deleted. Also u noticed she had blacklisted the number but forgot to set it to ""not show blacklist"". For those who don't know on Android you can blacklist numbers so when they text you it doesn't show. You can then show and hide these numbers. It's supposed to be used for people who are harassing you. 

I confronted her again and got really mad at her. I looked on facebook again and ended up finding messages that I hadnt seen before that made me believe that the only reason she didn't physically cheat on me was because he lives in Ohio and we live in Oregon.  They were basically making plans though for next time he came this way.  When I asked why she said it was because she ""felt like I don't love her and that she feels alone and that I don't give her attention"". I mentioned that I felt we've been doing really well lately and she finally agreed and said she doesn't know why she did it, besides that, and is sorry. 

I'm really hurt even though she didn't have sex with the guy. She sought intimate emotional support outside the relationship without talking to me or indicating there was any issue. Plus I'm sure if the opportunity was there she would've slept with him. This dude knew she was engaged. It's super emasculating as well. I don't know what to do. Part of me feels it's stupid to break up for someone emotionally cheating but tbh I've been cheated on before (physically) and this actually hurts more.

I apologize for grammar or spelling. On my phone. 

TL;DR

Fiancee emotionally cheated on me with some guy she met at her sisters wedding.   Making plans to do physical stuff. Discussing deep emotionally intimate things.  All of this without her coming and mentioning that there was any issues saying she's lonely and doesn't feel loved. I honestly felt like our relationship was super solid currently. Very confused.




UPDATE: Thank you all for you advice, because of it I had the strength to make a decision. I finally decided enough was enough when I found out that she told her family if she ""went missing it was me that did it"". I have never threatened her, got violent or physical with her. She went on the offensive to make me look bad and purposely sabotaged relationships I worked VERY HARD to build. Plus she basically laughs every time I tell her that what she did was emotional cheating. I thought she was a good person but that is not the case as I now can see.

Fast forward to today when we had our first big argument.

He's been very insecure a lot of things and I try very hard to make him feel like he's special but tease him sometimes about little things. 

His ego is slightly fragile and being in college hasn't helped since he's on a sports team whose members aren't very friendly and he has trouble branching out to other people.. Its a fact that I'm very aware of, but I was especially upset that I made him feel attacked when thats the last thing I want him to feel. If I ever poke fun at him, its more out of playfulness than malice but I can see how it can come off as critical.

69572,Relationships,1yvoz1,"So my boyfriend and I have been going out for about 5 months now. We've had history before, so this isn't our first time having a relationship with one another. This time around though was the first time I had actually acted in sexual activities. He's been my first kiss and well we've done pretty much everything… but sex. Before him, I was what I considered prude and was proud of that. Now, I've pretty much lost that, but I don't regret it at all! Don't get me wrong, I do love him. Well, for now and what I mean by that is that this is high school and we're graduating in July so who knows how this will end but for the most part, I love him. However, going from doing nothing at the end of last year to now talking about sex is quick. 

For me personally, the first thing that comes to mind about not being so for it is parents. About two months in the relationship we got caught in my room by my mom, he was fingering me.. Very awkward talk with my mom about making sure to behave and making sure I know what I'm doing. I've always had a close relationship with both my parents and love them, so the thought of disappointing them is extremely upsetting. Now, she is extremely skeptical and I can't simply hang out with him without having her questioning wether I'm having sex or not. 

Second thing, is pregnancy. The thought of getting pregnant at the moment is terrible! I don't think I would take the pill, my parents would never put me on it, and I am aware that there are ways of getting it without parent consent but that's just too sneaky and not what I would want to do. If I were to get pregnant, I would have no idea what to do and my parents would simply kill me. 

So now comes the big question, do I do it? I mean, as of now I've let him know that I'd rather not. But at the rate we've been going at so far it seems as if it's bound to happen. In March, my parents are going away for vacation and it just seems like a good time to do so. He wants it and I kind of do.

About a year and a half ago I was 20 dating an 18 year old finishing her senior year of high school. I was working part time while taking a year off from college. I remember everything about my relationship with her, from our first kiss, first time sleeping with her, and even when she told me that she loved me, and when I said it back.

Fast foward about 10 months to our break up and she does it a nasty way cutting off all contact with me while revealing she was cheating on me with 2 other guys.

I don't know why I did it, but for the following months after, I slept with 8/9 of her closest friends out of spite because I knew they thought I was cute. Every single interaction with a woman became a chance for a fling for me. That was until I met my current gf [20/F]

Fast foward to about 2 months ago when I recieved news about a mutual friend (actually the one who introduced us) and find out she's OD'd from perscription drugs (not sucide) and I see my ex for the first time since out break up, at the funeral. At this time I was in a 3-month relationship with this new girl and I was enjoying myself.

Fast foward to now: I'm back in college, in a 5-month relatonship with my gf (she is also in the same college) and she's wondering why I can't say that I love her back. I know why, it's because it's going to be hollow saying that doesn't mean anything. And I don't want to lie to her.

I want to finish with that I believe I have done everything right about this break-up (except the nailing all her best friends part). I worked out, met new people, got new job, and even focused back on my studies. But I can't stop thinking about my ex.

187478,Relationships,2h4i8i,"My husband and I have been married for 6 years and together for 11, both 30 years old.  Over the past few months, we've been experiencing what I would consider our first serious problem.  

My husband has an undiagnosed medical problem that is causing his vision to fail; he works from home for a good part of the day and doesn't drive anymore.  This has been a big stress and transition in and of itself in addition to our normal busy lives taking care of our 1-year-old, 2 cats, and house.  My husband felt lonely in the house all afternoon (kid is in daycare so he could work) and decided that he needed a dog.  We've both always disliked dogs so this was a huge shock to me.  

He ended up convincing me to adopt a 3-year-old beagle mix and everyone loves her...except me.  It's been about 2 or 3 months and I still can't stand the dog.  She is excitable to the point of jumping and barking at anyone entering our home (so toddler friends that come over are terrified and I can't even have a conversation with guests for 10-20 minutes because of the barking); she sheds everywhere, she eats any food left on the table or counters (can't leave muffins or cake to cool, butter has to be kept in a heavy dish, bread in a sealed bin, dinner plates cleared immediately), and stinks up everything, paw prints everywhere.

To try to adjust, my husband started taking her to obedience class, we bought a roomba for the hair, and I'm using various room deodorizers and my husband bathes the dog once a month.  But it's not enough.  I don't like the dog.  I don't like any dogs.  But now that she's here in our lives and making my husband so happy I don't know how to proceed.  I can't even say that she's not being taken care of, because husband does a pretty great job with all the care stuff.  But I just feel like it's too much.  I see less of my husband because he walks her for an hour after our kid goes to bed; I have to do more of the cat care because husband has pretty much forgotten about them, and I'm embarrassed when anyone comes to the house because no one can control this animal (which will hopefully get better soon with the classes).  

It gets me so stressed out that I am angry and resentful at my husband a lot and ended up sleeping in a separate room for the first time ever last night (dog sleeps in our room in a dog bed).  I can't calm down when I start thinking of the next 10-15 years of having a dog in my home, not being able to visit family or have a vacation without bringing this crazed, over-friendly dog (we live 3-4 hours away from our parents), and smelling dog on all of my belongings.  I feel like my husband has taken advantage of me and snuck this dog into our lives without considering my feelings or thought about how much work it is to maintain.

171666,Non-Romantic,2q5x3y,"hey guys, sorry in advance for the upcoming wall of text, the situation is pretty complex, but I'll try to keep it to a minimum. I writing this for the purpose of reflecting on it myself once more, see if theres anything else reasonably I can / should be doing and of course every feedback is appreciated.

The whole thing started in late August this year, my sister(23) and I have been getting a long pretty well the past 5 years (this was not always the case, of course we fought and such during our childhood but never anything meaningful in my opinion). She is still living at my parents, I live rather close together with my girlfriend. Since I moved out, my sister has been regularly using my bike and maintained it (changed a flat tire...). This summer, I got myself a new bike and wanted to go for a ride with my girlfriend, who does not own a bike, so I texted my sister to please leave the key to the chain so I can use it (she would be gone for the afternoon together with my other sister, who was visiting from out of country where she lives). When I go get my bike, they havent left yet so I ask for the key, my sister suddenly starts screaming at me, that I cant just take the bike away and so on. Being totally stunned by this outburst, I also get a little loud, saying its my bike and I its my right to use it whenever I want.

In the evening of the same day, it was planned that everyone in the family would gather at my place for food, as my sister was visiting. So in order to have a nice evening for everybody i text my sister something along the lines of ""everythings fine from my side, it just should not be a problem for me to use my bike once a year while she is not using it"". And with that I expected everything to be resolved. I was wrong. When my family later came over, my sister came as well but not saying Hello to either me nor my girlfriend, just eating the food we prepared for everyone and spreading a bad mood all evening. This really offended me, especially because I think its very rude towards my girlfriend. So I wrote into our ""family whatsappgroup"", that she was very rude and should just stay away the next time. Yes, I could have written that to her directly, but she brought it into the ""public"" and everyone in that group was there the evening before anyway.

So that was the last of that for a couple of days. Didn't hear anything back from her, sometime my parents approached me telling me that she was very upset about me voicing my opinion ""publicly"" and if I couldnt make up with her for the sake of peace (my mothers brother and sister haven't been talking to each other for a decade so she was a concerned about that). So eventhough I felt like I had every right to be angry and like I was owed an apology, I again text my sister saying that its OK, that I dont want to take the bike away and so on. No reply... After that I went on vacation but did not feel like someone who is behaving like this toward me has any right to use my belongings so I locked my bike so she could not use it while im gone (of course I left the key in a place where it could be reached, in case anyone would really need it / apologize to me in any way).

After the vacation, its late October already and I never heard a word from my sister, my mother urged me again to make up with her and apologize, she supposedly is so hurt because I wrote it into this whatsapp group... So I once more write her that I did not intend to hurt her in any way and apologize for that. I get a very angry response, saying its about the way I treat her in general and that I have to come myself and apoligize in person! (Maybe it is important to know that we have been communicating via text a lot during the last couple of years when we got along just fine, we never talk on the phone or anything). So still expecting an apology from her side, this was not the answer I was expecting and I told her that she should reevaluate her position and that she is just hurting our mother and that is why I apologized in the first place. So the situation did not get any better.

Christmas approached, we always reunite for that with the whole family, relatives are coming and so on, its kind of a big deal. I never expected for her to carry this out so long. My older sister, who repeatedly tried to talk to my younger sister to talk to me and resolve this, urged us to talk it out and finally got my sister to agree to talk to me last week. Or so I thought. But when I come to her to talk, she does not even want to open the door for me, then does not want to talk to me (for some reason her boyfriend was there, so he opened the door and got her to talk to me). But it quickly turned out that this was not about talking, all it was was that she was allowing me to apologize to her in first person... Of course I am in no mood to apologize as I already did that for the only thing that in my opinion warrants an apology in the tiniest bit and of course I was the one approaching her again and again to resolve the matter. But still, she insists she is the one that has been treaten badly here, she is the victim in this and she did nothing wrong and has nothing she could think of she should apologize for (I specifically asked that). So I have nothing to say to that. I asked her to give me an example of how I treat her badly in general. She could not come up with anything at first, then brought up stuff from our childhood, me mocking her with words as recently as 5 years. Never anything really mean or insulting etc., just saying stuff again and again that I knew would make her mad. You know, like kids do... Now to me this just feels like a stupid thing she makes up so she has another reason to tell why she is the poor little one here...

Of course this feud ruins the mood for everyone and I dont know how Christmas eve will be. I am actually thinking of spending it with my girlfriends family, rather than endure such a bad mood. But I know that would hurt my mother very bad, who is already heartbroken because all of this and the only reason I tried again and again to talk to my sister. This morning, I one last time told my sister that she can always talk to me, in case she has a change of heart. Which of course did not happen.

So from my point of view, I felt like I was the one who had every right to be offended in the first place but still reached out to her again and again and again, whilst she did nothing. The only thing she did that can be understood as ""moving in my direction"" was agreeing to talk to me, which turned out to just be her agreeing to give me a chance to apologize to her... I apologized to her, but after all of this I cannot apoligze again for something that she started in the first place and her not feeling sorry at all for anything and for dragging this whole thing out for 4 months. I am really angry towards her for all of that by now! But I also do not want christmas to be ruined, I do not want my mother to be hurt anymore that she has been already. I just dont know what/if I should do anything else. I tried talking to my sister, I offered her my hand again and again. I cannot say ""Oh, you know what, you are right, I am so sorry, everything is fine again"", I cannot get that over me!

Have I been handling all of this badly? Am I really the bad guy here and she is in every right to act like that? Any reasoned opinion is welcome.

Thanks for working through all of this. And merry christmas!

109740,Non-Romantic,2irkrh,"So I have an unresolved conflict that has been hanging over my brother and I for the past few years and I'd really like to find a way for us to get past it. I'm really hoping you guys can help shed some perspective on it. I'm going to try to give an objective telling of what happened before I go into my side and what I understand of my brother's side. Sorry if this is kind of disjointed, full of phone errors, and, obviously, skewed a bit towards myself

The Events:

My brother (Jack, 26 at the time), his girlfriend (Lisa, 21f) and I (22m) were all hanging out and drinking at their apartment in Summer of 2010. Their roommate/Lisa's sister (Allison, 24f) came home also innebriated, hung out, and played board games with us. This was only the second time that I'd met her. She and I flirted quite a bit and ended up making out/spooning on the couch together after Jack and Lisa went to bed.


The next day my Jack texted me, asking how it was but also saying that it probably wasn't a good idea to try and date her, as she had apparently just broken up with her long term boyfriend, though he said they were constantly in a kind of limbo. I said OK, and went on with my day. A couple days later, Allison started messaging me on Facebook. A while into the conversation, she clarified her relationship as being over. A couple days later, we set up a date in a park.


We dated for a short month and a half, with Allison and I hanging out with Jack and Lisa fairly regularly. He'd become more and more distant, less talkative around me, and would make comments about Allison that I felt had passive aggressive undertones. When it was just him and I, he would tell me about all of his beefs with Allison. During this time, I talked to some friends and family, and all the advice I got was to break up with Allison to save my relationship with my brother, which I ended up doing as Jack and I started getting more argumentative with each other.


Allison and I been hanging out at a bar and she was trying to guilt trip me into going home with her, rather than continue hanging out with friends who I'd not seen in a long time (the friend meetup had been planned for weeks, as well). I elected to continue hanging out with the friends. Allison took this, I'm guessing, as my way of breaking up with her, evidenced by the string of angry freak out text messages. It wasn't meant to be, and before she left we'd even made plans to hang out the next day. However, this was enough of an excuse for me to actually end things with her.


Since then, Jack has poked fun at me (thinking that the act of dating Allison was dumb of me), both to my face as well as to the rest of the family. He has since married Lisa, so we still see Allison every once in a while. Every time we do, Allison and I are fine, but Jack will make comments to me like ""Are you going to be able to restrain yourself this time, grogtron?"" Or, my favorite, ""Yeah, she's dating some new idiot. Poor guy, huh grogtron?""


Jack's perspective:


Allison was a trouble roommate to Jack and Lisa. The term ""crazy"" was used often, and he hinted once that she might be schizophrenic. I think Jack legitimately does not like her. He moved in with Lisa only after a couple months of dating, after he'd moved out of town to help take care of our sick dad then moving back without a place to live. Allison was high maintenance, did not like messes, and was a sleep eater (as in she would sleep walk at night and eat all their leftovers/bread/stuff). She was a source of stress for Jack and he was worried that any drama that happened between Allison and I would carry over to his home life. He also told me that he was trying to do the big brother thing and protect me from Allison hurting me. He uses her freaking out on me when it ended as an indicator that I ""got out just in time.""


My perspective:


It had been a really rough year for both Jack and I, as our dad died of cancer in the Fall of 2009. At the time that this all happened, I felt really isolated and alone. I was living with my best friend at the time, but he had no idea how to talk to me after my dad died, so he mostly stayed in his room playing WOW. My brother was in the honeymoon phase with Lisa, so we weren't hanging out as much as we used to, and when we did, he was texting with her constantly. I was relying on phone calls with an ex-girlfriend that I'd broken up with about a year before for emotional support. Allison had been really supportive about Dad for the brief time we were together, and it made me feel better to have someone to spend time with. I was also excited about the opportunity to be able to hang out with my brother more, them being roommates and all. I knew she and I weren't going to be a long term thing so I wasn't mad that we didn't last forever.Outside of the drama, I liked her, though, and don't feel guilty or regretful about seeing her. I suppose I'm mad that I feel like my brother turned it into an unspoken ultimatum. It's especially frustrating that he tries to make fun of me for it. It feels like I gave something up specifically for him and now he's rubbing it in my face.


It may also be important to mention that there's been friction between Lisa and I, both before and after these events. She's usually fine, but she used to be an asshole when she drank. This is much better now, but she would be too handsy--Hugs, touching my face/head, being way too far into my personal space bubble--with me for my comfort, occasionally made offhand joke comments about her, Jack, and I in a threesome, once hit Jack in the face with a TV remote out of anger, and one time scratched the shit out of my arm during casual conversation and called me a pussy when it started to bleed. Her and Jack almost broke up the night of that last one. Since then, she's been a lot better and we get along well, but I still try to avoid drinking with her.


What's happening now:

We don't really talk about Allison much, but when we do, it devolves to an angry argument fairly quickly. As I said, he's married to Lisa now, so Allison is still around every once in a while. I've talked to him about not making fun of me for it (which he misinterpreted as an admission of guilt), so he stopped doing it directly to me but has apparently been continuing with other siblings (I found out when our drunk older sister tried making fun of me for it last Christmas while I was giving her a ride home, basically parroting Jack).


He and I are both very stubborn, prideful, and, honestly, probably a little too full of ourselves. Neither of us are great at heart-to-hearts. I know that we were both in the wrong on this and that there's no easy answer. The events are all done and finished and all that's left over is lingering resentment. I love my brother and I want to clear the air, especially as they're going to have a kid very soon. How can we move forward from here?


Here's the TL;DR of events:

In the Summer of 2010, my brother was living with his girlfriend and her sister, whom he did (does) not like. I began dating said sister for a couple months before breaking up. Tension between my brother and I ensued and currently remains unresolved.

140245,Relationships,2tm4lv,"I've been with my SO (Mark) for 3 years, and I moved in with him and his mom (60F) shortly after we started dating. A few months after I moved in, we decided to rent a larger place (also more costly) that had a basement suite so that me and Mark could have the basement to ourselves and his mom could have the upper floor. 

Mark has gone through a few jobs since we started dating. One he was laid off from due to a lack of work, the other 4 he quit because either the work was too hard or he didn't like his coworkers. Whatever, he always would manage to find even temporary jobs in between to help pay the bills even if it was hard work. 

He quit his last job 2 months ago and decided he doesn't want to do labour work anymore. He doesnt have any other experience and has no high school diploma, so he is limited to basically entry level stuff. Thats fine, but he has made barely any effort to look for work other than online. He hasn't tried applying around the mall or at any of the tons of restaurants near our place that he said he wouldn't mind working at. 

I'm getting frustrated because I don't make much,
but I'm paying for rent, bills, and food for 2 people and I'm worn out. I can't even afford to buy facial soap or new shoes that I need because mine are falling apart. My phone is now cut off and sitting at a bill of about $600, but I've been paying his phone bill because he at least needs a phone to get callbacks for jobs. 

My only other option is to move back in with my family (about a 2 hour drive away) where my mom says she wouldn't charge me for rent until I got back on my feet financially. I don't really want to do that, Mark would definitely be upset, but I am really unhappy like this. 

I know that partners are supposed to support each other through hard times, and normally I would without any question, but shortly before all this, Mark severely betrayed my trust (I can explain why if anyone is interested but it's really a whole other can of worms... I'll just say that if it happens again I plan on leaving) and I'm having major doubts about our relationship because of it, which is making me question whether it is even worth it for me to support him through this.

He didn't say who he was at first and told me it was someone I hadn't talked to in awhile. I wasn't sure at first but then I recognized his voice. He sounded strange, like maybe he was drunk, but I didn't to be rude and hang up. He kept asking me about what I was doing and where I was in my apartment. I kept trying to talk about my boyfriend but he wouldn't really participate. 

I was getting weirded out so I tried to say my phone was about to die but he just said he would wait while I plugged it in. I had to plug it in by my bed and when he learned I was in bed he mentioned that laying in bed was very sensual. I tried to get off the phone again and he kept asking me to stay on the phone. He went silent but then I thought I heard moaning so I hung up. He tried to call me again but I didn't answer. I texted my boyfriend as soon as I got off the phone and explained what happened. I then went and showered and broke down crying. I felt used and disgusting. 

My boyfriend came home later and I broke down again. He promised that I would never have to see him again and that he would talk to him about it. Fast forward to a month later and his dad is coming up for a wedding that he is going to with my boyfriend. My boyfriend says he is leaving the night before to pick up his dad from the airport. I told him that was fine but just not to bring him back to our apartment.

He just shrugs at me and acts like it's not a big deal. It turns out he asked his dad about it and he claimed he never called me, so my boyfriend basically decided to forget about it and act like it wasn't a big deal. I was heartbroken. I felt like he was accusing me of lying. He told me that he knows I didn't my make it up, but that I was probably mistaken when I thought it was his father. He said I didn't have any proof.

126420,Relationships,2iayxq,"Hi, all. It's a complicated issue, not really sure where to start.

I have been with my boyfriend for a little over a year. He is great, and our relationship is mostly good. We both want long term commitment and to bond on a really deep level. 

Years ago, all through high school and part of college, I had a severe self-injury problem. I have dealt with it in therapy before I started dating my boyfriend. It is no longer an issue in my life at *all*, but I still do have lots of visible scars from it (on my thighs, mostly). My boyfriend has asked about them before but I've told them that it's a difficult topic to discuss. I have never outright said that they are due to self injury, but it's quite obvious. Just... the topic has never been outright discussed between us.

So, moving forward. A few days ago, he told me that if I still had a problem with self injury, that I should get help for it and he felt it was his duty as my boyfriend to tell me. I told him thank you, but that I had solved that problem years ago. He began to ask questions about it further, and I told him that I felt uncomfortable talking about it too in-depth.

He feels as though my reluctance to discuss it in-depth is me not wanting to be open with him in our relationship. He has now voiced concerns that he said that he felt that our relationship was at a point where we could share anything and everything with each other, and now with my reluctance to discuss prior self harm, he is upset with the fact that our relationship is no longer at the point he imagined. I disagree, and think that I am perfectly fine sharing anything/everything with him, but this topic is just a difficult one for me to discuss, because I don't even like thinking about it in my own head alone.

Further, his mom made a comment I do not appreciate. His mom has always seemed to like me, but she does like to get too involved in our personal life occasionally. His mom asked how I was. He responded fine, but then told her all the problems from his perspective I mentioned here. She responded with ""well, if she really loved you, she would talk to you about it."" I'm also a little annoyed with how he complained about all of this to his mom, but I can move past that.

Does anyone have any advice? I really love him and want to show him that I DO feel like I can share anything/everything with him, I just feel sad thinking about this one topic and it's not personal to him.

65020,Relationships,3dmyn8,"fresh break up only a couple days in, Ill start with a little history of us together.

Year one- I met her through a friend in elementary school we became friends and stayed in contact for a couple years liking each-other on and off but never acted on it do to things going on with others at the time. But things changed when my mother went to the hospital for appendicitis, she visited me all the time to talk and console me on my mothers health and we started falling for each-other romantically. We couldn't stop always messaging, visiting, kissing, hand holding, until we were finally official. We had a great first year amazing dates, sex, and everything in between. She told me everything, and I told her everything I could, I've never really had anyone close 3 person family parents always fought so I bottled a lot of my problems and some small friction but we continued through, and persisted in telling her I would open more up as we were together longer. We end up pretty much living together because my parents are pretty lax, and it we were both happy being together every night. 

Year two- Begins just as great as year one, were both working attending are separate schools have separate lives. Finally I divulge some information about earlier in my life that no one knows in order to bond with her, I've never really liked talking about my feelings but I wanted to try for her, and it seemed to bring us closer together. But things started becoming to comfortable for us some time during the end of the year, stopped going out to see friends regularly and just spent time all the time, she was truly one of my best friends and I was okay with that.

Year 3 - I continue to bottle things up, she asks whats wrong I say nothing. It was how I was brought up, I try to deal with things myself but Id try to tell her if it was her fault or someone else I just couldn't express myself properly in that way , expressing love came easy, expressing my depression was harder. My parents constantly fight, I put on some weight, we started having less and less sex. But there would still be many great times between us, where everything seemed perfect, I truly thought those outweighed the negative things in my life. She made me happy and she was always there for me when I needed her. Some point in the year my self-esteem would feel destroyed and I guess I changed and wasn't the same person that I was when we started dating, and I was closing myself off within the relationship. Around this time a mutual friend starts coming over more and more often till hes practically living here too, and we lose that alone time we once had, but I figured if anything was wrong shed just tell me and Id tell him to leave if he was around to much. I end up finding out she was texting another guy inappropriately, we fight and try to move on. My trust was broken and Id start checking her phone, trying to keep tabs on her. I was afraid of losing the only important thing to me. And this persisted up untill 2 months ago. Where we had a big breaking point knew I was checking her phone and she couldn't take the lack of trust anymore, I explained the reason I would check is not to exactly catch her up to something but validate she wasn't when everything else was crap in my life (which was mostly true). But I told her I could stop and change, because I couldn't be without her, shes truly always been there for me emotionally when I needed it and I couldn't reciprocate it. So i began doing what I had to do to show her I loved and trusted her and we could change our routine. See her friends more, spend alone time together again go on dates and of course I stopped looking at her phone. I was worried about losing her so I decided right then in there to move on and stop, it wasn't worth losing everything we had to me.

Final conflict- Since the last one, things aren't great (due to a bunch of other stressful things in our life) but everything seemed good between us, kissing, having a bit more sex again (not like we ever stopped all together though), having our alone time and going out together, as well as incorporating time in our schedules to see her friends more often too. But this only lasts about a month before I get an unexpected break up.

She tells me we need to talk, my heart sinks.. this never means anything good. I ask whats wrong,  she cant seem to get the words out of her mouth. But she says it, she cant continue anymore, she feels like something has been missing from us, she says she still loves me and considers me her best friend which made it only more shocking to take, not much happens this day because I'm having trouble taking it in we say goodbye and goes home. The next night she comes over to collect some stuff and we start talking. I try to get her to change her mind, I tell her to give me more time things are changing, they really were for me I wanted to be better I wanted to express myself for her and for me. But alas she says its to late and shes been feeling this way for a while, always emotionally exhausted from me bottling things up and her wondering whats wrong, and that if we stay together that she will only end up resenting me, because things weren't changing for her, even though she knows I was trying hard and told me to keep aiming for my goals and move on, that someone would make me happier than her and to focus on myself. I asked her if this is it forever, and she said she dsnt know that she knows it would help me move on, but she cant rule it out cause she does still care for me.  We've kissed once or twice since then, and she even has reached out and held my hand. So I just have no idea what to do anymore. And to make matters worse we have a summer job together so there is no avoiding each-other or getting any real distance. Id quit if I didn't need the money with school coming up, but am in a tough finical position.

Anyways I could really use some advice on the whole situation, should I wait, try and move on?

166999,Relationships,2833a5,"My husband has a terrible temper and flys into fits of rage over the most insignificant things, like my leaving a cupboard door open or my walking too loudly. He also has a drinking problem and drinks most nights of the week. When he gets mad he screams and swears and brakes and smashes things and throws things at me (thankfully usually missing). I don't do anything to provoke these outbursts and go out of my way to avoid doing any of the long list of things that bug him but I somehow always still seem to set him off.

He has on numerous occasions gotten physical with me when he is mad and drunk- mostly pushing, grabbing, slapping, etc. But the one time I threatened to leave him (and he was actually sober) he pushed me onto the kitchen floor, sat on top of me, put his hands around my neck and squeezed. He asked if I still wanted to leave and I nodded so he squeezed harder and asked again so I shook my head, he let go of me and I never brought it up again.

My husband is also very jealous and controlling. He is free to go to the pub with his friends 2 or 3 nights a week without question but if I want to go out to dinner with my friends even once in a month he says yes but then makes such a big deal about it, questioning what time I will be back and who will be there and what I am wearing, that I feel anxious the whole time I am out, worried I won't be home in time. But even when I am he is usually still mad at me when I get home.

My husband never apologises after a rage or physical altercation. There is no honeymoon period. After he has gone crazy at me and hurt me he will be extra mad for a few days and give me the silent treatment. He blames me for having made him mad, so he feels he has the right to be mad at me about it.

Obviously he also has a good side and we can have some great times together, which is why when it is bad I start to plan to leave and then when it is good I loose my resolve and feel it would be easier just to stay.

The main thing stopping me from leaving is fear. I am absolutely terrified of my husband and scared of what he would do if I even threatened to leave again. The second thing stopping me is logistics. I have 4 young children and no where to go. I think if I left it would have to be thoroughly planned and executed in secret, which would be nearly impossible with 4 children and with how controlling he is.

I have no proof of anything. I have never called the police. It would be my word against his. I fear that even if I managed to get away that we would end up in court over the children and we would have to share custody and he would use the contact with me to either manipulate me into going back to him or perpetrating further violence.

I have no idea what to do.

TL;DR: My husband has a anger problem, a drinking problem and is very controlling. I want to leave but I am scared and don't know what to do.

1992,Relationships,1ral48,"Hello Reddit,
I am posting here because I really don't know what else to do.
My girlfriend and I have been dating for a little more than 11 months now, and it has been amazing. We are perfect for each other and have been extremely happy up until recently.

Our relationship has been going downhill for a few weeks now in different ways. Back in October we got together and she felt like she couldn't handle a relationship anymore because of school/volleyball/work, etc. She was stressed beyond belief and didn't know how to handle being in a relationship in the midst of all of this. After a long time of crying and talking it was apparent that the stress was the only thing bringing this problem to us and that we obviously didn't want to lose each other. 

Fast forward a few weeks and we are into November. Things just aren't the same between us in a way. She has been growing increasingly distant and seems like she is losing interest in the relationship. Basically just a ton of little things that put together resemble a whole bigger picture. So all in all things just aren't the same anymore and it is hard to put it into words. I have brought this up to her trying to figure out what is wrong and she blames it on school, blah blah blah. 

Fast forward to last night when we are together after a party and we drive to a parking lot to talk. We talk about our relationship and what is going on. She says she still loves me (this is genuine) and that she doesn't want to lose me, or see me with someone else, but at the same time doesn't want to be in the relationship. I point out to her that the problem rests in her because she hasn't been putting effort in anymore and has been growing increasingly distant. I explain to her that if she still wants to be with me she would work on her problems and start making a conscience effort to make things right between us and we would have to work together to relight the spark. At the same time she doesn't think things will change with her for whatever reason. I ask her why and she doesn't have an answer. 

So one side of her still completely loves me and doesn't want to lose me and all of that, but another side doesn't want to be in a relationship and feels that she can't handle it anymore/doesn't want to try and make things work out. 

We are meeting tomorrow to talk things out and make a final decision. But I need some outside advice on what the right choice is. Thank you for the responses.

62759,Relationships,1t5f1g,"Hi all, 

I'm facing this issue in my current relationship, and while we've only been together a few months, it's happened to me before and I assume will only continue to happen as I seem to have an inordinately high sex drive for a female . . .

Anyway, the bf and I have been together for a few months now, as mentioned, and we get along great, have a lot in common, the sex is fantastic.  Our sex drives are just completely juxtaposed.  I know I fall into the stereotypical guys are all about sex ideology and that's obviously not correct, but it's getting to the point where it's just crushing my ego and it feels like I have zero say in the relationship or the sex life.   

I probably want to have sex at least twice a day, if I were to be totally contented.  Him on the other hand . . . maybe twice a week.  And we always fall to his schedule.  Not to say that he's pushy about it, but you can't really force someone to be in the mood, and it's a lot easier to tell me no.  

I have moderately good self esteem, but to be turned down daily really gets me down.  I've talked and talked to him about it, and there's not much that can be done I feel like . . . I'm consistently going to be wanting more and he's consistently going to want less and it's going to be me that gets the short end of the stick.  I've told him it makes me feel powerless and like a child but his response is always what can you do.

He's not very vocal in his admiration for me, he's not one to drop compliments and I can understand that, not everyone expresses vocally, but lack of sexual desire seems like he doesn't want to express it physically either.  Since he doesn't express it vocally, it makes the rejection that much harder to handle.  (In previous relationships where this was an issue, my SO would go out of their way to make it abundantly clear I rocked their socks, but they just weren't feeling it that evening)

Since we've started dating I've been obsessively visiting the gym, masturbating more often, and in general just trying to distract myself from it, but nothing manages to slow my libido down and nothing takes the edge away when he rejects me.

I don't hate him for it, and I understand that not everyone has the same sex drive, but I don't know what to do to protect myself from feeling like shit.  I've tried to stop initiating but even trying to limit myself I still end up emotionally torn to pieces.

165056,Relationships,1lpqwi,"My husband and I have been married for almost three years.  We were married for a year and then got pregnant. We had our son just before the  two year mark. 

We are dual military so I am away from home (we got stationed right near his home town, I am from the South and we're on the West Coast) and because I am away from home I like to send my parents pictures and updates on their grandson. My husband doesn't like this and he even went as far to say 'you never take pictures of you and me it's literally just our son'.

After that he went on to reveal that he feels very under appreciated and that he is married to his son's mother and not his wife. (our son will be 1 in October by the way.)

This is where I'm confused and lost. My husband has been playing Magic the Gathering for a little over a year now. At first it was an innocent thing: buy some packs, make a deck, play with friends, go to Friday Night Magic. He eventually decided he was better than FNM so he started going to tournaments that were at minimum two hours away. I don't mind this. It's his hobby and he obviously loves doing it. 

It's what he does at home that bugs me. He wakes up, looks at r/spikes (a magic subreddit for 'pro' players) and looks at various other MTG websites. He goes to work, plays the game all day long with his friends, picks up our son, goes home. He gets back on the computer and reads articles and looks for 'spoilers' (for cards that are coming out). (Also I work 10am to 8pm so I drop my son off and he picks him up) 

There have been times I get home and my son hasn't been changed out of his diaper from day care (he gets out of day care at 4:45) and my husband is just sitting on r/mtg or r/spikes or reading his articles. 

He also plays a lot of DOTA 2 with his friends. If he isn't looking at magic stuff that is the other thing he is doing. I have to wait for him to be done just to talk to him. Then when we are talking we only get to talk for a few minutes because by the time he's done with his activities it's 10pm and it's bed time for him. 

But he feels under appreciated. Whenever I try to say 'well you could play a little less magic and we could hang out more' he gets angry and says that he feels that magic isn't the issue here.

He also says he feels that he isn't ready to be a dad. He's been saying this since my son was 3 months old. Keep in mind he will be 1 in October. I've suggested counseling- he saying it won't help anything. I've suggested we get his mom (who is only 30 minutes away) to watch him for a night or a weekend so we can go date each other and he says 'oh that won't work she won't watch him' (but she actually offers every time we talk to her). 

I feel like he is making tons of excuses and just pointing all of his issues at me and blaming me. How can I fix my marriage? I can't stop being a mom and I can't make someone who isn't happy just be happy. I don't want a divorce.

126026,Dating,2a1slz,"I'm 21 years old and bit inexperienced, so I would like to hear some advice on my situation and future actions.


In a New Years party I met a girl. We hit it off quite nicely. In the same party I met her best friend, let's call her Kate. While dating the girl I met Kate a few more times and learned that she had a boyfriend, which she started to date mid-december and they became a couple just before Valentines. I liked Kate for multiple reasons, but that was strange of me, because I'm an only one-girl-at-a-time type of guy, even though we were only dating. I didn't let it show that I liked her. The four of us celebrated Valentines together and I talked with the guy a bit - he was ok, but, so to say, a bit peculiar, without going into much detail. After Valentines we stopped dating because there were no feelings between us.


3 weeks ago I congratulated Kate and the girl on graduating. Kate and I texted a bit back and forth. She told me that her boyfriend dumped her for no reason at all, but after talking to him he appologized and she took him back. I don't know the full details, but I will try to learn them later on, because this seems strange to me. After that, as she said, the relationship wasn't like it used to be. While texting I told her I liked her back then, and that if was strange of me, because of my old fashioned approach to dating. She said that for now she's unavailable, but she would like us to keep in contact. My university exams started and I didn't have much time to talk to her.


One week ago, after my exams had ended, we texted a bit. I asked about the relationship, and she said it was so-so. The day before yesterday I surprised her - I went to her summer job. We talked a bit and I invited her to a concert which took place the next day, she agreed. The concert day she picked me up, we went to her house, drank beer and talked. The conversation went fluently, naturally and without any pressure or any awkwardness at all. We both tried to learn waltz together and after that she played me the piano ( I love pianist). While going to the concert I laughed the hardest at my life and she laughed till tears. At the concert she introduced me to her younger sister, with who I found a common language really fast, and Kate's boyfriends sister joined us in our conversation. Later on I danced with Kate and her sister, and they both said that I was the best dancer that they have danced with. Before dancing I talked with Kate - she said that her best friend (the girl I dated) didn't mind her seeing me. She said, that she knows my intentions, but has a boyfriend, but we didn't manage to continue the conversation, because her sister disturbed us. After dancing I asked if she wanted to continue the conversation - she said now, which I find good.
The time I spent with her was better than some of the sex I've had.


I really like Kate. We have this natural connection. I haven't said anything bad about her boyfriend to her or anyone and I'm not planning on destroying their relationship directly. I didn't try to touch her inappropriately or kiss her - I don't want her to cheat. For the time being I want to get to know her better, have a great time and make a good impression of myself, but I don't want to become her best friend or something like that.


I secretly hope that the boyfriends sister will tell him about me being at the concert with Kate. That could make him jealous, which in turn could end the already broken relationship faster.


So I ask you, readers with more experience than me - how should I try to approach this better? I was planning on seeing her once or twice a week for max of 3 hours, having a great time and no texting from my end, only to make plans. Just getting to know her better and let things take their flow.


Yes, yes, there are plenty of fish in the water, and I may be a bit blinded, because it's the first time I feel so free and comfortable with a girl.

TL;DR - How to get a taken girl, who's relationship isn't in a good state, but trying to avoid being the bad guy in any way.",Me [21 M] going after a taken girl [19 F] who is the best friend of a girl I dated,0.0,False,8.0,33.0,1404742464.0,/r/relationships/comments/2a1slz/me_21_m_going_after_a_taken_girl_19_f_who_is_the/,Romantic
174838,Relationships,33hem0,"Hi, sorry for what will inevitably be a huge wall, I'll try to break it up periodically. My friend started talking to me the other day asking for help about his situation (that I was previously unaware of) and I don't really know what to advice him to do. There's sort of a lot of things going on and I think I'm going to try to quote approximately what he said to me so here goes.


Ever since he started dating his girlfriend he’s been out of contact with most of his friends because she gets very jealous. He feels like he’s not allowed to have friends but a good amount of his friends are girls which is probably why she gets jealous. (We haven’t talked in basically 6 months, I assumed he was just busy since I knew he got a girlfriend, he said the only reason he was talking to me about this now was because she was at school and that he felt guilty). He says he thinks he loves her but that sometimes he wonders why they’re in a relationship but doesn’t feel like he can leave her because it would hurt her. This is basically how he explained it “She has severe generalized anxiety and ocd. She hates when someone coughs or clears their throat around her, to the point where sometimes she'll yell at the person, that person mainly being me and then her excessive jealousy causes issues. Anytime someone even remotely attractive shows up even on TV or a movie. She’ll stare at me with that ‘you better not be looking at her’ glare”

 
Apparently I’m the only person that he’s talked about this with.  She’s seeing a therapist for her anxiety and ocd but he doesn’t think that she understands how much it’s affected him. He doesn’t tell her this because he doesn’t want to worry her more than she already does. Evidently she worries herself a lot and her anxiety controls a lot of her life and emotions. He also mentioned that he’s been thinking about other people sometimes when he “should only be thinking about her” and that makes him feel guilty. I asked him about leaving her but he said that he’d have nowhere to go and that “I can't do that to her. She’s been through so much heartbreak as it is. Cheated on by just about all of her exes. I'm afraid of what she would do if I left her” 


On the issue of not having anywhere to go he said he’d probably become homeless because his job isn’t enough to live by himself. His mom is in a bad living situation “living with a man she once loved, who is now treating her like total crap and taking advantage of her” and the only other place he could go would be his mom’s ex-husband who lives in a different city (his siblings live there). Their relationship is okay but then he’s have to find a job which he said would be very difficult because “I can't sell myself for the life of me” and “I’m terrible at interviews”. He seemed very against going to live there because he wants to be independent and doesn’t think he should have to rely on others. He wants to prove that he can do things for himself, be independent despite his asperger’s and adhd. “I've spent much of my life relying on my family: my mother, my uncle, to pretty much live my life for me. I can't do that anymore. I've been stuck in this state of childhood, and I need to grow up.” 


He thinks he may be falling out of love with her but that he wants her to be happy and she wants to be with him. He feels like he’s leading her on because he can’t see himself marrying her or sharing the rest of his life with her. Oh also to make things better they’re 2 months into an 11 month lease of an apartment they share. In addition to that he feels shallow for not being able to look past her weight which is something she’s very insecure about. He tried mentioning it nicely and she took it the wrong way. I asked whether he’d talked to her about any of the other things and he said that he has to a point but he doesn’t want to hurt her. 


“We've honestly gotten in quite a few fights and each one wears on me. I don't know how many more fights I could handle, but again, I am just so afraid of what she would do that... if it came down to it, I would not be able to bring myself to leave her. Towards the beginning of our relationships, anytime she and I fought, it would end with her holding a switchblade, open, in her hand as if she was going to use it on herself. The idea of her doing that runs through my head, and scares the living daylight out of me. If I was to leave her, and she did something to herself it would be a heavy burden that I would probably never rid myself of. She hasn't done anything with the switchblade in the past couple months... mainly cause I hid it from her.” I asked if anyone knew about that, he said no.

So I think that's about the gist of it. If anyone read all that and would like to give any advice that would be super appreciated!

10993,Relationships,33xwrv,"My boyfriend and I met in early January and became serious fairly quickly. I told him how I was hesitant because I was just concerned it would fade out as fast as it all happened, but he assured me that that was a silly thing to be worried about and that we would always talk about everything. Around mid-march I noticed him becoming increasingly distant. I just brushed it off thinking it was because he had exams coming up and was stressed out and whatnot, so I tried to back off a little bit which was hard because I felt totally unwanted and disregarded in every way. It started with him just being less present when we were together. It always sort of felt like he didn't really want me to be there. There was no intimacy (from hand holding to sex). Soon he would take hours and hours to respond to any text messages, and would blow off any plans we had to hang out. 


I asked twice if there was anything wrong, he said no and that he was just busy and stressed. When I finally called him out on it after blowing me off for the 3rd time, it came out that he felt like he needed some space. That when it feels like a task then I just don't do it, and lately it's felt that way. I asked if he wanted to break up and he said he didn't know, just that he needed space, and that we would talk soon. Mind you this was all over text because he didn't feel like seeing anyone that day, even to talk about this.


So we haven't seen each other since March 31st, barely had any communication since then, and at this point I'm still not sure what to think of the situation.


tl;dr, boyfriend wanted space, it's almost been a month, I still want to talk to him to find out what's going on but he has not made contact with me and the message I sent saturday afternoon has gone un-answered. I'm caught between emotions of understanding and frustration. I don't want to rush him but at the same time I feel like I deserve to be in the loop. I don't know how long to leave him alone.

179152,Relationships,3acq75,"I met a lovely man in January.  Let's call him Stan.  He reaches out to me after learning about my involvement in community work regarding sexual reproductive health and HIV counseling in an effort to bounce off ideas for community building in the HIV+ community; he discloses his HIV+ status to me, and before I know it, we become friends.  It quickly escalates into something intimate a month later, and I also learn about his history of bareback hook-ups and meth use, and that he's only been sober for a month and a half (at that point, at least; the longest he was able to maintain sobriety was 7 months).  Throughout, he has been attending groups three times a week, and meeting his sponsor and therapist on a weekly basis.  I was scared, and a little rattled (not about his HIV status, though), but I saw him as so much more than that.  I still see him as someone more than his afflictions.  

---

A little more about him: he's moderately high functioning, highly educated, employed (for now, at least), articulate, and adherent to his HIV medications and has maintained an undetectable viral load for the past couple of years, which decreases the chances of transmission significantly (I'm also taking Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis).  I’m not worried about HIV.  In fact, if it weren’t for his interest in community health and HIV activism (probably afforded by his being HIV+), I probably wouldn’t have been as drawn to him, as that is something I deeply care about as well.

---

We get along very well, and we genuinely enjoy spending time with each other, whether we're staying at home cooking all day and watching movies, or out enjoying jazz performances together, things just feel natural with him.  He's a sweet man, and has, out of all the men I've dated until this point, respected my sexual boundaries the most.  Despite his substance abuse, he has never made me feel unsafe or threatened in any way, nor has he ever stolen anything; he is one of the most generous guys I know.  He has dreams he wants to accomplish, and he plays me Etudes on his piano while I fall asleep.

---

Getting back on track.  We've been ""dating"" (more than friends, but not official--does that make sense?) on and off since January (so we've been seeing each other for about ~4.5 months cumulatively).  In February he tells me there's kind of someone else he's seeing, and me, being the lovely sap I am, tell him he should go with the other guy (they had a longer history together, and feelings like that don't just go away).  It was hard, and for a while we were a part.  Later on, it turns out that the guy he was with was also in recovery, and that he had relapsed about a month and a half during their time together.  At this point, Stan calls it off (being around that kind of trigger wouldn't be good for him), and me and him start to hang out again, and slowly start to pick up where we left off.  However, he felt so beaten up about the other guy, that it reached the point where he--unsurprisingly--relapsed as well, and since then, he's relapsed about 4 more times.  

---

Every time it's happened I've been there to support him.  We communicate very well, and put everything out on the table.  I've told him that I'm more than happy to be a support, if he wants me there, but that he has to be the one to do the work in getting better.  It has to be his choice, and it needs to be acted upon by his effort.  The first thing I ask him when he calls me the morning after a binge is, “What’s your plan?”, and I hold him to it.  

---

However, he’s relapsing right now as I type this, and has been for the past 24 hours.  I haven’t heard from him in over a day, and I’m scared, frustrated, angry, and most of all incredibly sad and helpless.  This is slowly killing him, and I can't bear it.

---

More context:  Meth use amongst men who have sex with men are very often within the context of unprotected sex e.g. they search Grindr and other hook-up apps/sites for guys that have the drug, and since an effect of the drug is heightened sexual arousal, well, you know what would happen.  Unsurprisingly, it’s how he contracted HIV, too.

---

The last time he relapsed I took it very hard.  I told him that I wanted him to learn to be able to stand on his own feet—because there wasn’t always going to be someone to help him, and that I needed some distance from him because I was just too emotionally invested and scared for him and worried (I have nightmares of his death), like I am now.  I don’t take his use personally (i.e. I don’t feel like he’s using meth to hurt me), and I don’t take the context of use (hooking up) personally, either.  For a while, the distance between us was very helpful, but we soon gravitated toward each other again and became really close.  We want to be with each other, but I told him that I wanted him to prioritize his recovery first.  Not long after, I kind of gave in and told him to seek the advice of his therapist, sponsor, mother, and people in his therapy groups about what they would think about him having a relationship on top of working towards recovery.  Things were good for a week, and the silly, naïve, and hopeful part of me started to feel somewhat optimistic that he would be able to make it past a week this time, but here I am, feeling utterly helpless at home as he’s going through another relapse.  This is the first time that he hasn’t called me the morning after, and I’m scared.  This is essentially day two of his binge…he’s going downhill fast, and I’m not sure how long he’ll be able to keep his job.

---

I know he needs friends.  I want to be his friend.  But I can’t help but not feel like I’m being a selfish asshole if I distance myself from him.  I feel like I’m caught in a bind:  Will me “breaking it off” cause him to relapse?—I can’t bear that thought.

Anyway, I'll give a little background first. I first met my girlfriend when I started at my university as she lived in the same dorm building. She had a boyfriend at the time and we became best friends (just friends). She was having problems in her relationship so I would try to get her to talk to me about them. This was a challenge at first but sooner or later she would come around and it would really seem to help her and that felt good.

Plenty of time went by and she and her boyfriend broke up and we started dating a while after. This was a clean break up and she and I were nothing before it besides friends. Shortly after we started dating, I fell hard for this girl. I mean I am deeply in love with her. Our first anniversary came without a single hiccup in the relationship. Everything was perfect!

It's now been two years and things aren't so perfect. Things aren't awful but they aren't good. I need some advice in the communication field. She really started to open up to me when we were just best friends but now she is as verbally locked down as a safe. I admit that I am nowhere near a perfect boyfriend and I oftentimes don't believe that I deserve her at all but sometimes she will just stop speaking to me. No matter what I do, I cannot get her to speak. She simply gets in bed, buries her face in a pillow and almost goes to sleep. I feel like she is trying to get me to figure out whatever I did to upset her but I cannot figure it out. I spend countless hours trying to think of what I did and try asking her only to be greeted with, at most, a moan or grunt. I know I should probably give her space but I am really bad at letting things go when I don't know what I have done and I continue asking what it is that I did. Recently she yelled at me that I don't give her space and pushed me out of the way and ran out of the room. My reaction, in my head, was ""if you wanted your space, you should have conveyed that thought to me with words."" 

Am I unreasonable for wanting a verbal conversation with her about our problems? Our fights often consist of me talking to myself while she about takes a nap. I would leave her alone but if I drop it, which I have in the past, it is never brought up again. Any time that I bring up that I would like to talk about something that has been bothering me she goes into lockdown mode.

I seriously love this girl. This is pretty much the only reason we fight and I always end up feeling guilty. I just want to know what it is I can say without upsetting her to get my point across about how I am affected by this silent treatment. What should I do?

Now for my issue: I've been in about 3 or 4 relationships, all which have ended quite badly due to the fact that they've been various degrees of abusive, the worst being my last ex boyfriend whom I broke up with a year ago. I ended up getting therapy and looking inside myself to figure out why I always seemed to date men who ended up being emotionally or physically abusive and have been really working on my self-esteem and self-reflection and I feel like I've gone a long way....it's really important to me to learn how to be in a functional, loving relationship so that when I have children, they won't have to go through what I went through as a child with my parents.

I’m not too much of an emotional girl. I’ve never been one to fall for someone quickly, in fact when I start having a relationship with someone, it always feels like they have stronger feelings than I do. I care about them a lot and like being around them, but never any butterflies or super strong feelings...I always just felt like I was different and although I wanted to feel like that for someone, I just accepted that it just wasn't me.

SO. There's this one boy who was in a class of mine for about 6 months and I developed a crush on him (which is pretty rare for me) and finally one day we kissed and started hanging out every day. It's been almost 3 months and I am totally head over heals for this guy. He's completely unlike any other guy I've gotten involved in....respectful, motivated, sweet, wanted to wait a month to have sex so that it would be special…he’s everything I thought a perfect guy would be, although I thought that didn’t exist. Not to say he doesn’t have his problems (has a hard time communicating when he’s upset with something…um, actually that’s the only one I’ve found so far) but he’s just everything I could have ever wanted. I’ve been searching for any kind of red flags from him and there's nada. We're both pretty introverted, him even more so than me, but we've spent pretty much every hour of the day and night with each other and have verbally expressed how interesting and exciting it is to us that we both finally found someone we love spending time, with even more than just by ourselves.

Last weekend was really, really wonderful, and while we were laying in bed guess I entered into a period of complete insanity and told him I thought I was falling in love with him. 

He got really, really weird. Just kept asking me if I really was, and asked if I was sure...and said that in his only serious relationship, the girl said she loved him and immediately crushed him. He acted really weird and distant for a few days...until we finally had a talk, and I said that I was sorry...that I probably don't even know what love is, and that it was too soon. He commented that his parents say it to each other because they want to be with each other forever, and then asked me how he would know that I really meant it if I ever said it again, because he felt like a belittled the meaning.

I asked him if he wanted to break up with me and he got quiet for a while…finally he said he needed a full week to think about whether to continue our relationship, and to talk to his mom and sisters, for advice I guess. I'm CRUSHED. It's pathetic....I feel like we've already broken up, I'm sleeping by myself for the first time in months, and I'm extraordinarily confused. On one hand, I feel like him and I  just clicked, like I've never felt with anyone before. I'm dying for him to just knock on the door and tell me he wants me to come over and we'll pretend like it never happened, so we can do all the things and have all the experiences we were talking about having in the future. But on the other hand...I'm pissed. I feel like I'm almost being demonized for expressing my feelings, and whether it was wrong to use such a heavy word I really don't think it's fair that he apparently can't see my point of view, coming from divorced parents who never once showed any kind of love when they were together. And I feel like I’m being strung along and he's just waiting to break up with me, because I feel like if someone needs a week to think about whether they have enough feelings for someone to continue to be with them, then they probably don’t like them enough and I’m just waiting now to hear the final “I’m sorry but no”. This sucks assssss. 

I also don’t really have anyone to go to for advice. My family is a no-no, and we’re both in the military so I don’t know many people here. Oh yeah, we’re going to be working together…for the next 5 years. So it’s not like I can do the no-contact thing, either. 

Am I wrong in wondering if it’s an overreaction? We were so happy and he expressed that he had feelings for me in so many ways, and now: this. Can anyone shed some light on the subject? I’m so pissed at how much of a pathetic wreck I am right now :(

That’s enough of my rant. If you read all the way down to here, I’m thoroughly impressed and astonished by you. Thanks.

90232,Non-Romantic,2kn18w,"My girlfriend is the oldest of five girls and was born to her mother when her mother and father were 19. She has a very poor relationship with her father and a so-so one with her mother. Her three youngest sisters and her get along great, but her other sister, the only one with the same father as my girlfriend, has had issues with my girlfriend since we got together. She has actively tried to ruin our relationship and give my girlfriend's parents false information about me to get them to hate me as well. It worked with her father.

Tonight, we went to dinner at her mom's for the first time in over six months. Her mother was insistent that my girlfriend get into contact with her sister. My girlfriend has been trying to talk to her sister, but her sister has no interest as, this summer, when her sister got ""engaged"" to a man she has known for 2 months and been dating for one, my girlfriend texted her asking exactly how long they had been together. We found out about her engagement via Facebook. Her mother, after my girlfriend's explanation, showed my girlfriend ultrasound pictures with sister's name on them. She is due in April.

My girlfriend tried to contact her sister through call and text, she ignored the texts and literally made sounds like she had no signal on the phone. She intentionally went to her friend's house so she wouldn't see us. Also, she and the ""fiance"" broke up and she is moving 3 hours away to live with their dad next week.

My girlfriend wants to be involved, but was asked not to let on that she knew. She wants to see her before she leaves as well. We have no idea what she should do.

103928,Relationships,2sexxr,"My cousin has been dating the same woman for about 7 years now.  She has continually gotten more and more controlling and abusive and its gotten to the point where I'm left wanting to intervene and I'm *all* out of ideas and advice to give.  Any kind of different perspective or advice would be greatly appreciated.


**Her Background**: Megan is a cunt.  Please note that I dont use that word unless its absolutely fitting, and she's the text-book definition (just read on and you'll see).  Now, i feel *a little* bad for calling her out on being a cunt because I've recently found out that her life-long friend and high school sweetheart committed suicide shortly after graduating high school.  I believe this is the defining moment in her life, resulting in some pretty fucked abandonment and insecurity issues... which turned over and over in her head, resulted in her being a controlling cunt.  Honestly, mad sympathy to her for having to be put through that.  That side of the equation makes sense to me now.


**His background:** Jack is a very easy going guy.  He wouldn't hurt a fly and is just all-around compassionate... to a fault.  I've seen him dish out a little of the drama back at her, but I believe its some sort of self-defense mechanism and typically reactive to her being a cunt.  I get the impression that sometimes he does this shit so she'll get **really** angry and not talk to him (as if that's a punishment).


**Their background**: Not sure exactly where to start on this one so i'll just enumerate them in rough chronological order;


*mind you, I've forgotten more fucked up shit this girl has done that is listed here*


* Installed a tracking device on his phone
* Shows up at his friends houses repeatedly (using said tracking device) and caused many a scene (I picture her dragging him out by his ear).
* Attempted booty dance shit-faced with just about anything with a dick at my sisters wedding... fucked because the list of victims include me, my brother and my father. (this one was just *weird*).
* Demands *immediate* response times to contact. Flips her LID when he doesn't.  I've watched this girl re-dial his phone for 30-45 minutes simply because he wasn't answering.
* Calls his work any time he is staying late.  And not in the sweet, ""i'm worried"" way... its the ""you BETTER not be with a girl"" kinda thing
* Called a *bar* when he was getting a drink with a friend from out of town and he stopped texting her b/c it's a 5 hour flight and all he was doing was texting her while they drank.  Got the bartender to give him the bar phone!


Mind you, i've had conversations with Jack throughout their relationship about how *nuts* this situation is, and how happy he would be if he moved on.  He's acknowledged many times that he knows i'm right but shrugs it off because its easier for him to put up with this shit than hurt her and break her heart.  Then Jack tells me he's going to be going back to school and moving 2500 miles away.  GREAT! I look at him in the eye and ask him, ""you're going to break up with her, right?"".  To which he legitimately convinced me it was likely going to happen.

*...This is my complete and utter lack of surprise...*

The list continues;

* 100% of his daily schedule is memorized by her, from 2,500 miles away this crazy girl knows his every move, every new acquaintance... everything.
* Calls for TWO HOURS straight one night when he's at a (guy) friends house and his phone is charging while he sleeps.
* Manages to convince Jack to give her his Facebook, instagram, email and iCloud (fuck a 3rd party tracker, now she can and does lock his computer remotely so he'll answer his phone).
* Messages some of his (pre-assigned) female group members for a semester long project in college, accusing them of trying to steal him and proceeding to call them sluts.
* Has ruined many... many friendships of his via **direct** intervention.

There is more, this list goes on and on and on. Sorry if that is too much, I wanted to provide a sufficient spread of fuckery to illustrate how severe and terrifying this woman can be.  Now, mind you, he's not 100% innocent.  I know he's cheated on her, which has exacerbated things and was not ok for him to do.  I know he is horrible with a phone and he's just an all around forgetful person, which i suppose is less blameworthy as its simply an incompatibility.

I dont know what this woman says or does to him to prevent him from getting out, but at this point i'm convinced he wont break up with her, he's told me ""its not that simple, Megan would not let go easily, i'm scared what she would do and i'm just too nice"".  This was the point at which I knew this was some major league shit.  I figured he was refusing to let go of a woman he once loved, but no, he's terrified of the consequences... 

Like i said earlier, i'm at a loss at this point and i'm just looking for more perspective on this as i'm in way over my head on this one.  I can relate up to a point as I've had several abusive relationships, but nothing quite like that.  How can I help him? Is there anything more I should do to try and hammer the point home? Shit i've even thought of telling him I can't associate with him because its too painful to watch him subject himself to this shit.  I want my cousin back, I want him to know what real, secure, adult love is like.

111420,Non-Romantic,2yfusz,"This weekend, ""Sarah"", one of my best friends, celebrated her birthday at a club and our friend, ""Amy,"" decided to invite her new boyfriend, ""John."" I've only met John once before, so I don't know him, but Amy's already introduced him to some of her relatives even though she's only been dating him for a month. John is Amy's co-worker, so they've been keeping their relationship on the DL. Thus, this was the first time John's been out with our friend group. Safe to say, Amy really likes him, especially since this is her first real boyfriend after the end of her last long-term relationship. My boyfriend of a year was out of town this weekend, so I was flying solo with my lady friends.

When we got to the club, John started getting schwasted and began to get extremely handsy with everyone including Amy. I was completely sober and hanging with others, so I didn't interact at all with John at this point. About two hours later, I decide to sit down for a while next to John and Amy. At this point, John is hammered beyond repair and begins trying to grab my hip/ass, all with Amy rift next to us. Feeling beyond freaked out, I started pushing him away and tried to get up to get away. Suddenly, he reaches UNDER my shirt and grabs my waist, trying to pull me back towards him/get me to grind with him. Several of my friends see this and are semi-horrified. I shoved him off and immediately ran out of the club. One friend who witnessed the whole thing looked at Amy to see her reaction and said Amy shrugged it off. I asked Amy about this later and she said she didn't remember anything like that, so she probably didn't see fully what happened. Sarah was in the bathroom during all of this, so she heard about this later from others.
 
John groped other people (both male and female) during the event, but I was the only person he tried to go that far with. Several friends who saw and others who found out texted me all day asking if I was ok after the club. I contacted Amy the next day to ask how she was feeling and to let her know what happened with John. Amy became extremely distraught and kept apologizing although I kept insisting John wasn't really her responsibility and is an adult. John later wrote me a long apology note, basically saying that he was really sorry and went overboard trying to have fun with the group.

When my boyfriend came back in town the next day, I gave him a general outline of what happened, since I knew he'd find out from either a mutual friend or his roommate who was at the club. My boyfriend is the sweetest guy ever, but when he gets angry he has the tendency to internalize this rage. Consequently, based on his reaction, I can tell you I've never seen him this angry before. He had to lie down for a couple minutes because he was breathing so heavily, asked me what the guy looked like, and told me if Amy stays with this guy, I need to stop being friends with her (but in more profanity-laden terms). He then furiously texted his roommate for like twenty minutes and held me tightly for the rest of the night, telling me not to worry because he'll ""take care of everything."" It was basically a moment out of The Godfather.

I'm slightly worried what would happen if my boyfriend and John are in the same room, since I'd rather not see my boyfriend on the nightly news. Simultaneously, I'm worried how Amy's going to handle this situation and whether she's going to keep going out with John. Since they've started dating, John has been overly romantic (sort of in a Casanova kind of way, saying things like ""every time I see Amy is the best time of the week, because she's so beautiful""), so to see him act this way when she finally introduced him to her friends must be extremely upsetting. Especially since I was the one he groped. Amy and I had a falling out a few years back because the guy she was seeing before John drunkenly facebooked me flirty, highly inappropriate messages. I'm worried she somehow blames me for her last break-up and I don't want her to see me as the source of my problems. Likewise, I don't want anyone (John) to get hurt because of this and am starting to blame myself for telling Amy and my boyfriend about what happened. What should I do?

76091,Non-Romantic,2wmk8q,"My boyfriend [29M] and I [23F] live with his best friend Ben [26M]and Ben's girlfriend Jess [23F]. They are usually pretty good roommates, however Jess can be really irritating. If she's not having fun, she gets angry if anybody else has fun. This occurs almost every time we get together.

For example, we all went camping together this summer and were sitting around the campfire. Jess came over with a Frisbee and asked if we wanted to play. Nobody did, and she started getting angry and telling us to Get off our asses, why did we come camping if you're just going to sit around, yadda yadda. Ben got up to play just to placate her, but as they were walking over to an open area, she stopped to kick over my boyfriend and I's cooler.

Anyway. Tonight the four of us plus another friend were all sitting around at home having some drinks and pizza. I take an anti-depressant for OCD that I can drink very mildly on (I have confirmed this with my doctor). However, I also take the occasional benzo for panic attacks (VERY infrequently) and I had to take one today, so I was not drinking.

We were just sitting around making fun of a terrible SyFy movie, and then a movie came on that I was really into. Everybody else was watching too. Jess, who had been in her room, came out and said Let's play a game! Who wants to play sociables?. She looked at my boyfriend and I, and we said Eh, doesn't matter. She looked over at everybody else and they said they didn't care. We were all sitting around staring at the TV, everybody obviously wanted to watch the movie.

Every two minutes she would ask So are we playing? and we would pretty much grunt collectively. She was standing right in the middle of us looking around with a pack of cards. Eventually Ben said Okay, I'll play. She sat down right in front of the TV and started rattling off rules while everybody was STILL watching TV.

She then said I'm going to put some music on, is that okay and my boyfriend and I both said Nah, just keep the movie on. Everybody else chimed in and said to keep the movie on. She replied If I do that, is anybody going to actually play? I bet you're all just going to watch TV....

NO KIDDING, that's what we were all doing before you sulked your way into playing this game!

Anyway, I cannot drink heavily so when she turned off the movie I went to the kitchen for a snack then went to my room. My boyfriend came over to see me and asked what was wrong, and I said I can't play and my movie got shut off, I'm bored. He just shrugged and went back to the game.

This is also the only TV in the house. Our room is a new basement suite and we don't have cable down there yet.

So I came to my room, and now Jess is out there asking a million questions about why I ditched them.

I would probably enjoy the game if I could a) actually play tonight and b) wasn't harranged into it, but Jess drives me nuts when she does this.

Should I suck it up? Am I being petty by avoiding the party?

115927,Breakups,20phcy,"So, some backstory. A couple days ago my girlfriend called me in the morning and woke me up. She was worried because I wasn't responding to her texts. I told her I was sleeping and she seemed okay with that and asked if I ""changed"" anything. I said no and had no idea what she meant and we said goodbye and such. I checked my phone and saw that she sent 10 messages about how good she felt for doing something, then asked why I changed my FB password (I never changed it). Then I checked my email and saw that she attempted to change my password about six times.

See, for some reason, she thought that every time I didn't talk to her for an extended period of time that I was with someone else and cheating on her. I would have never done anything like that and have never given her any reason to think I would. 

After I found that out, I confronted her about it and she said something along the lines of ""well I'm sure I'll make the next guy happy"" and blocked me on FB. It was then that I decided that I had enough. This was not the first time she ""broke up"" with me and I was tired of dealing with all this. The night before the call she had even told me that ""this relationship sucks"" because I couldn't relate us to some couple on her favourite show. So quite frankly, I decided that this was the last straw and cut off all ties with her and ended it for good...or so I thought.

She contacted me late at night saying how she still feels for me and that she was sorry. Again, this is not the first time she's apologized for her behaviour. Yet, she also seemed to acknowledged that we broke up instead of pleading for us to get back together. This gave me conflicting emotions because then I started to remember all of the good memories we had and I broke down. I didn't tell her anything but I still felt horrible.

The main reason we broke up is because I don't know if I can see a future with this girl. Her personalities change in an instant, and she's very demanding and strict. I can't do anything unless it's okay with her. I didn't have the same ""guidelines"" for her. She could also get very angry with me for the smallest things, like if I couldn't talk to her at a specific time or if I said a sarcastic joke and she took it seriously. Yet, the memories of her when she was sweet and kind and adorable rushed into my head and I can't think straight. We used to talk about our future together all the time like what kind of house we'd get, the kind of dog we'd have, the number of kids, etc. so it seems so sudden that that future isn't going to happen.

I don't know what to do. Many of my friends said that I did the right thing and that the relationship was toxic, but it hurts me now that those three years with her seem to be wasted time. She was the first girl who actually understood the introvert that is me and called me perfect and it seems like I'll never experience that with another woman again. I feel like she's changed the very person that I am and I don't know if I can go back to the kind of person I was before her.

136499,Relationships,2w5src,"Alright reddit. I guess i should start with a very long backstory.

So i met this guy, we will call him Robert, when i was 17. I had never dated, grew up extremely Christian, had only kissed one other guy prior to Robert. Needless to say i was super innocent, and when we met we were both interested in a long term serious relationship. This was all great initially, i lost my virginity to him, tried drinking with him, smoked pot because he wanted me to try it, and was very sexually submissive. Over the first year i changed immensely. Personality didnt change much but my appearance and my morals/views changed a lot. A feel now that a lot of this wasnt really my own opinions, but more my people pleasing nature appealing to Robert's ideas. I was really happy with him for a very long time, we had our moments but overall things seemed good.

 I moved around 2 hours away for college in August but we have done pretty well being LD for the most part. In the past few months he has basically cut my best(and only) friend out of my life as well as becoming a lot more comfortable with his own flaws, but not really in a positive way. He has just kind of stopped trying, letting a lot of the little things go and giving into others. Ive posted probably five or six times to this subreddit from a variety of accounts in fear that he would see them and get mad at me for asking for advice on how to deal with him(particularly anger management and talking down to me/not hearing my opinions, not really trying in the relationship). Each time that ive gotten brave enough to talk to him he ends up feeling really hurt but saying he will try harder, and i forgive and forget.

 Ive been getting more and more of a feeling in my gut that things just arent right over the last few weeks. We had pretty much always planned on getting married in a few years(he told me he loved me after 8 days of knowing me) and having kids and all that, we wear promise rings and have plans to move in together this fall.

A few days ago i met another guy, we will call him Taylor. Taylor was dropping off a job application at my work and we got to talking, seeings as we will probably be coworkers soon we exchanged phone numbers and facebook. The past few days we have been getting to know each other and im starting to develop feelings for him. Talking with him has really opened my eyes to how controlling Robert is and that im really not happy in the relationship anymore. Ive even reconnected with my best friend(thanks to Taylor's encouragement) but havent told Robert because he would be mad. RObert has never come near to physically abusing me, but im starting to see that there are a fair amount of signs of emotional abuse, and as much as i still love him i realize i need to get out.


My biggest dilemma is that we have two big out of state(prepaid and non refundable) trips planned for march with his work and my family.  One i had to work really hard to be able to go, and the other I owe my parents $1000 for Robert's plane ticket(which he agreed we could split). I just need to know if i should end things before or after these trips, as finances would make after easier as well as allow me time to get a lot of my stuff back and kind of ease out of the relationship-but i know that its not fair to string him along if the feelings are gone.

After some time I noticed she would like everything he posted so I clicked on her and he was liking her stuff too. No big deal right? Right?

I asked who she was and he gave me a vague answer that explained nothing and said I was 'carrying on' about girls. I stopped shut up and that was that. 


It continued.. Then I added him on snap chat (I never use it because guys get pretty dirty on there) and when I added him, she's number one in his snap chat and the top three are all girls.

I grew a weird feeling. I've known him for years and never heard of this girl she doesn't have mutual friends except for one and I asked him if he knew her and explain why I thought and felt weird and my friend asked the girl if she was single. The girl said she was seeing someone but wouldn't say who.

It's odd? Right? Or am I just being stupid like he says?

If this girl was seeing another guy wouldn't he have a problem that she was sending pics and videos to my SO? 

I ended up giving in to my feelings and said something to him and he got angry and said I was calling he's bluff and I don't really have a friend that knows her, he also said I'm accusing him. But he's still snapping away and hasn't gotten rid of her but says she's nothing?

Quick background - we met and it was whirlwind love affair. Truly in love. Everything going great until 4 months later I cheated. I got drunk got my dick sucked. Regretted it instantly. 3 days later she found out and we broke up. 2.5 months later and lots of couples therapy, we are working our way out of it. 


During the 2.5 months since, there have been more ups and downs than the Himalayas. I think we've ""broken up"" more than a dozen times. Each time for a different reason, but all relating to me not being a good partner. 


Recently we had been good. 2 whole weeks without a break up. One decently big fight relating to $, which is another issue in our relationship. She has none, and I pay for everything, which has created some resentment on both sides. She says that if the table were turned, she would not have any problem paying for everything. I feel like that is easy to say for her because of the situation. She has been able to use the relationship status as a way to get things out of me. Recently she said she would have to move away in order for her to pay for her school and work full time. That would most likely mean the end of our relationship. So I offered to pay for things. 


Anyways, like I said, we had been good, but there is this persistent issue. Every once in a while, she feels like I am hiding something. Most of the time, her intuition has been right. Whether it was a flirtation with another girl, or just a deleted text, I copped to something. I’m happy to go through this process with her. I want her to feel to comfortable and trust me. I love her, and I want this relationship to work because I think she is great. The problem is she doesn’t trust me. 


At this moment, she is accusing me of hiding something, but I’m not. Truly. There is nothing that I can confess to at the moment. Nada. Zilch. Zero. I asked her to meet with me after work, but her response was, “Are you going to tell me what you are hiding from me”.


Her suspicion stems from a text she saw between my buddy and I. He jokingly said we should do a GF swap. I said, Yea, then I said I should probably delete this text. Then I did. I forgot that she is signed into my Ichat now, so she sees all texts that happen between iPhones. I let her see all my shit now. I have nothing to hide because I feel I have been on the straight and narrow, but it hasn’t been good enough. 

Does anyone have any constructive advice? Personal wisdom? Please don’t just take a shit on me cuz I fucked up a while ago. Trust me, I have felt like shit, and she has not made my life easy these past ten weeks.

169011,Relationships,1ia8ex,"So I've run into an issue with my SO of eight months. Generally, things have gone just fine. We get along great, we have a healthy sex life, etc. We have the occasional argument like any couple, but nothing that serious. 

I was sleeping over at her place the other night and I tried a couple of things to get some kissing/touching/etc going, but I was basically ignored. I got a little annoyed with her, but figured she didn't quite realize what I was trying to do, so I wasn't too worried about it and I didn't bother getting into it with her. I just passed my irritation off as nothing, and moved on. 

Later, once I'd gone back to my place, I apologized for being irritable. She asked why I had been irritable in the first place and I explained what I had been trying to do. She apologized for not noticing ... but then admitted that she had purposely been avoiding any sexual contact. 

Naturally, I asked for her to explain why ... and she refused to go into any further detail. She told me that I should just accept that there is some reason she won't do this anymore, and stop pressing the issue. I made it clear that I was pretty upset that she didn't feel comfortable talking to me about this problem she was having that was making her avoid me, that I felt like she didn't trust me, and that she wasn't upholding our agreement to communicate better with each other. (Some clarification here: When we first started dating, we realized that both of us are not always great at communicating when we have a problem, so we made an agreement to try and be more open with each other about our issues.) However, she shut down and refused to talk about it, only saying that she was upset that I was not respecting her privacy, and that she had nothing else to say/no thoughts on the problems I was bringing up. 

Am I crazy for taking issue with this? Is wanting a reason for her decision really not respecting her privacy? I feel like she is shutting me out for no good reason, and keeping something that we may be able to work out from me. Plus, I have no idea how long she plans to keep up this self-enforced rule -- or, again, WHY she's decided she doesn't want anything to do with me, sexually. I'm also worried about her ... I just want to be able to help her. 

TL;DR My SO of eight months has decided not to do anything sexual with me anymore and refuses to explain why because it's an ""infringement of her privacy"".

For now, I've left her alone since our fight to give her time to calm down and think things over, but ... what should I do now? I would really appreciate an outsider's opinion on this since most people I could ask would be extremely biased.

188004,Relationships,2hq2zu,"My wife and I have been together for six years, but we've only been married about a year. No kids, just us and a feline and canine companion.

When we first started dating, she had trouble keeping a job (she couldn't keep her mouth closed and would make enemies). She also made several poor decisions before we met and was still making a few.

When I started college, she was able to hold down a job and everything seemed to be going well. When I was working on my graduate degree, she was also attending school, but ended up dropping out as her grades were suffering. In all honesty, she has some learning disabilities, so college isn't for her. We talked about it and agreed that she needed to take a break for a few years, then potentially try a community college.

I obtained my masters in May and am currently working full time as a teacher and am taking a few graduate classes that I was missing for full certification. She works part time (15-25hr per week) at a grocery store 30mi away. She transferred to this store when we moved out here (for my current job).

She was working two departments to get as many hours as she can, but told me that she is no longer going to be working in one of the departments as she cannot handle it. Apparently she doesn't get along with some of the employees in that department, and it has been stressing her out.

I make 4-5 times per month more than her. I wouldn't consider this a problem if she contributed a little more, or if we had kids she was staying home to take care of. Her monthly salary is just barely enough to cover her car payment, student loan bill, cell phone, and gasoline. My salary has to pay rent, insurance, utilities, groceries, etc. I change the cat box (but we both rotate on scooping it), I clean the bathroom and kitchen, I take out the trash, pay all of the bills, manage finances, keep up with groceries, and do all of the cooking.

Ideally, I'd like to buy a house in 3-5 years, but at this rate, I have very little money left over after everything is paid. My biggest issue lately is when I buy something for myself, she complains. I bought a $40 dremel tool recently and she asked me ""did you really need that?"". I basically told her that until she starts contributing more financially, she really shouldn't have much of a say in how I spend my money.

My friends have been telling me that I should consider my salary to be ""our money"" as we are married and everything is shared.

Her finding a full time job in town (instead of 30mi away) would solve a lot of problems. The only issue is that she basically has no jobs skills (which I accepted) and is stuck with retail jobs, many of which are hard to find full time.

Any thoughts?

However, in the last few weeks the sexual side of our marriage has been lacking, he's been wanting sex less often, but depression doesn't seem to be a cause.

He just seems a little obsessed with bills and how to save money, we don't underspend or overspend, when we're in bed I try to talk intimately to him, but it gets overshadowed by talk about bills and retirement investments, or planning for Christmas but surely there's a time and a place to talk about such things, not in bed when I'm wearing my sexiest lingerie trying to seduce him? Isn't there a time and a place to discuss such things?

He has no issues at work, no stress from work so I can't understand why he does this. I did try asking him in a calm open and honest manner but he said it's impossible not to worry about bills the way the world is today.

I want sexual intimacy but refuse to take a lover as that's crossing a line too far,it's cheating at the end of the day, but I think it's this mini-obsession with bills that has killed his passion for me, I'll be honest I've never said I'm not in the mood to him.

I suspect but can't be certain that because we didn't live together before marriage is why he's worried, he's probably not used to living together as a couple.

I've been with this guy for a little over three months, exclusive since about a month in. He's funny, smart, considerate, and relaxed, all great qualities. We've enjoyed a fantastic sex life, but I'm having some issues when it comes to sleeping over at his place (he has his own bedroom, shared apartment). I live with my parents to save money and they're very conservative so him staying over is out of the question. 

My issue is that I'm really insecure when it comes to my sleeping habits, not just around SOs but with friends and family as well - I dread any situations where I have to sleep near anyone else and strongly prefer to sleep alone in my own bed.

I have mild sleep apnea so I snore, but it's not severe enough to need a cpap machine. I have to wear a night guard to keep from grinding my teeth, which forces my mouth open, making me snore more, drool all over my pillow, and have bad breath in the morning. My hair is always a mess, unless I wrap it like I should, but then I'm sleeping in a scarf and that's not a good look either. I occasionally get gassy in my sleep &amp; have to wear acne cream overnight from time to time. Lastly (TMI, sorry), I have IBS and I'm too terrified of going number two at this house (or anywhere but my own house), and it's often the worst in the morning (meaning long times spent in the bathroom). 

Explaining that is so gross to me and probably to him too. It's so embarrassing. I could probably go on forever - basically my issue is that so early in the relationship, I don't want to expose my SO to this messiness. It's just really unattractive and I could see it as being a major turn-off.

I've managed so far to avoid sleeping over by making excuses about needing to do homework, parents being strict (even though that really shouldn't be a problem at my age, but that's a whole other issue), work early in the morning, etc. At this point though he's starting to wonder why I won't ever sleep over and said he'd love to have me stay the night with him. 

On one hand, I don't want to keep putting it off and have him think there's something wrong with our relationship, but at the same time I don't want to get to the point where I've invested so much time and emotion and then find out he's too grossed out/annoyed to sleep over with me. Obviously the latter situation doesn't bode well for any sort of future, which we haven't talked about but is in the back of my mind. 

This insecurity is driving me crazy and it's the last serious barrier to true intimacy in our relationship. Am I not giving him enough credit? He's amazing and I'm truly enjoying my time with him, but I feel like this is going to be a huge dealbreaker and I want to know what I'm dealing with here. I'm going to need to get over it for this relationship to move forward.

I of course understand, even though I prefer to be alone or with a small group to celebrate the new year. 

I feel very uneasy about him going to this party, though. He told me that he was invited by a coworker, and then proceeded to regale me with an explanation of how he had stopped being invited to parties because of his tendency to get a bit crazy back when he was single and had just moved here - barely a year ago. Prior to that, he had had a lot of hookups and often partied and got drunk. I was then informed that coworker told him she could get him drunk in the hour he would be there before midnight, and offered to let him sleep on her floor.

As an aside, my past is very much the opposite of his. I don't party at all, have had sex with only one other person, and do not drink.

Anyway ... I don't know why this bothers me so much. We are very much in love, and he has promised countless times that he would never cheat on me. The man I met and know now is wonderful: loyal, trustworthy, and responsible. When he went back to his home state to visit friends and family, he went out drinking, and that didn't faze me at all. He even told me that he wouldn't drink too much (at this future party), since he wanted to be able to drive home and then come up to see me later that morning, new year's day.

I mean, now I feel like a terrible person, like I don't trust him enough. I don't want him to go, but that is *incredibly* selfish of me, to tell him not to go, and to tell him to be alone again even though he would be miserable.

128257,Relationships,26n6pl,"My boyfriend and I had been together for 5.5 years. It was a good relationship for the most part. We had a lot of good times and our fair share of bad times as well. I was with him through the toughest times for him. He suffers from depression and an anxiety disorder and I was there for everything. The last year was especially hard for us, I was tired of him coming up with excuses on why he can't get a job and other things, and he was tired of me treating him like crap. After an exceptional fight he broke up with me.

 This crushed me and broke my heart. Shortly after however, I started to date online. I was finally starting to feel like myself again and be happy, when he comes to me and confesses that he never stopped loving me and I was the love of his life and he wanted me back.

 The problem is I started to have feelings for a new guy. I don't know if it was true feelings or just the idea of him. I told my bf all of this and was as honest as I could be to him. I kept asking for more time to figure out how I feel, but he really wouldn't take no for an answer. I told him I would give him a fair chance and I really didn't. I tired to cut it off with the other guy but he kept contacting me and I kept responding. 

I've been trying to figure out what I want and how I feel. Its been a hard few weeks for me and for my bf as well. Well to make things worse I wanted to see the other guy once more to see how I actually felt about him. I eventually told my bf about it and now he's absolutely heart broken and feels betrayed by me. I feel like a piece of shit and I don't think he'll ever trust me again. I'm going away in 2 weeks and I know the entire time I am gone he will assume that I'm being unfaithful.

I've been talking to this guy for relatively +5 months. We've been an unofficial thing but everyone knew we were exclusive. Eventually said SO introduces me to his small group of friends. One of said friends is a girl he had been really close to for about a year. She named her baby after him, has admitted feelings for him before but they never acted on it and stayed friends. With this knowledge in mind it's rational to be jealous and feel like she's a threat, no? I've tried to be understanding of their friendship but I get so consumed with jealousy when he talks to me about how she hates me because I'm taking away from their friend time. I try to give him space but I do like spending time with his as any good girlfriend would. I have had multiple conversations about how uncomfortable it makes me that they hang out alone so often and if they could hang out with friends around at least. He said that I needed to accept their friendship and but more trusting which I've tried to the best of my ability... 

Fast forward up until recently. I went to the gym to work out after work, and I could've sworn I saw the two together working out. This was after a whole day of him not answering my texts and him previously telling me he was working all day. I approach them to find out its not them but I text his friend who says she's at his apartment and he's napping confirming why he hasn't responded. I go to hang out with them and all is good and fun until she leaves. I jokingly admit what happened and how upset it made me but nothing insane. He finally admits that if it's that big of an issue he didn't want me around. He said she is a very good friend he is not leaving any time soon and that if I cant handle that then I needed to leave.

12995,Infidelity,2c74ce,"TL;DR My boyfriend is going to craigslist casual encounters in cities that are hundreds of miles away from the one he is in and answering T4M ads. When asked why he says because he is bored.

I've been with my boyfriend for 3 years. We are both divorced and have children with our previous spouses as well as a child together who is 1. He is former active duty military, a combat vet, and currently enlisted in the reserves. Our relationship has had a lot of up and downs.

So my boyfriend cheated in the past while I was pregnant so I have full access to his phone, the phone bill and usage info, and his email. I recently discovered that he had been answering craigslist ads in the casual encounters section in cities that are hundreds of miles away from us. It's always T4M ads. I am very confused as to why he is doing this? I tried to ask him about it and he simply said he was bored and got very embarrassed. He didn't physically cheat and obviously there was no way he could get to said city he was answering the ad in and it just seems absolutely ridiculous.

Now, I will say he does have a thing for femdom, pegging, and tgirls. I know this and I have no issue with it. Our sex life is almost exclusively Femdom with me fulfilling his fetish. It works out well because I have a thing for sissifying.

My question is does anyone have any idea why he is doing this? I fulfill his sexual needs almost daily, I have no issues with porn, though he prefers erotica, so he isn't lacking in any of that. I just don't get. I am pissed too. It's disrespectful to me that he did this AND he wasted that poor persons time who thought someone was going to show up and take them out. Ugh.

We have a son who is Autistic and needs care for he is unable to communicate like normal kids his age (6) and he is a handful so I was given the role to stay home and watch over him and care for him since family can't deal with him because of the difficulty.
Today, out of the blue. I was told by my gf that I have 5 hours to pack my things and get out.
I clean, cook, care for our son and do as much as I can for her and let her go out whenever she wants when she wants to enjoy time off. I am not the perfect guy. But I do my best with what I can do since I can't hold a job due to someone to deal with our son.

I don't own anything. TV, car, furniture, etc etc it's all hers. All I can take is my clothes and that's it. I cried my eyes out and felt like someone just broke my heart and completely destroyed right now. I've told her everyday I love her, how much I love her, and she has done the same to me. Then today it all changed.
I wish I could have the one thing I love the most, that is my son. But I can't win taking him. I have nothing and no job. He is my world and love him no matter how he is. It hurts so much to think I would be apart from him the most.

Right now I desperately need a job and fear for the worst right now not being able to find a job due to lack of work experience in past few years.
I don't know where else to go but here and cry while I type this out but it's the only people I can tell. My dad would be so hurt when he finds out. Love hurts. I live in London Ontario. It's going to be extremely hard to find something with my circumstances but I am willing to go anywhere for a job. I mean anywhere, move and go.

In the past she cheated on me for 2 years without me knowing. She even did trips to the US with this guy. I trusted her and always gave her freedom and have fun with her friends. I am not a control freak and make her stay at home. She is off at times in the way she thinks.

The reason she is kicking me out is because I am not able to provide. I do not cheat on her, ever in the past or now. I barely go out and I have only got out once in the past 4 months to hang out with my friend. We made the choice that I would stay at home and care for our son. He does not speak, has a major delay. Has angry burst and hits. He does not go full time to school due to his issues and I get calls to pick him up early at times because he is behaving badly. It's tough when family doesnt help babysit and we can't find anyone who would want to deal with him to help so I can go to work...

After she cheated on me in the past. I left. She wanted me back and it was tough but I forgave her and we moved on. Everything seemed good. Until recently.  I need to tell my dad what is going on and ask to stay with him.  Such a struggle right now.

**Update 2** So today was the day we met. I had everything I needed to say prepared. We met, sat down and I said everything I had to. I said that I was deeply and truly sorry, that we can fix this, That I am working on fixing myself and that I understand how bad I hurt her. I told her it would never happen again. After I had finished saying what I had to, she said we wouldn't get back together, nothing I could say would change that. I said kiss me one last time and if you feel nothing then I have to accept that this is over. We kissed and she still said no. I left for my place feeling hurt and angry. Devastated. Later, my friend texts me, says we should get food. So i meet him at CVS with his brothers and cousin. I get a text, and its her. I asked her why she was texting me and she said that she wanted to talk. I get to Subway and she asks to meet, I ask my friend if I should go, he says yes, and we meet and go for a walk. She apologized for being mean earlier. We kept walking and talking, at one point we stopped and held each other. I reiterated what i said earlier, that I love her, I was sorry this happened, that it is my fault, that I am trying to fix myself and work on the relationship. She told me that she loves me, she wants to be with me, and doesn't want to move on. She also said that she doesn't know if she could ever trust me again, and doesn't want to promise that we will get back together again. My friends are saying I should wait, my cousin says fight and build the trust back slowly each day. My cousin says that I should text her once every day. I also texted my ex and said we should meet every friday at noon. But i am confused. Am i still able to get her back? what do you guys think?

I started seeing a girl in May who had just moved cities and wasn't sure if she was going to continue seeing her boyfriend in a long distance fashion because they were having problems and she said she was considering leaving him for me.

He knew we were hanging out a bunch but didn't know or wouldn't accept things were more than friendly.

I had long been planning a 2 month trip to Asia (I live in the US) and this was a major factor in her deciding to get back with her boyfriend. Before I left she said she was having trouble choosing between us, and if I promised to factor her into my plans after my trip we could be together. Right there I told her I'm out. I told her I didn't really want to be a choice anymore, she should just get back with her boyfriend. So that's exactly what happened. I already have guilt over my participation in her cheating on him, but now it's only worse now that they got engaged. They got engaged a month after I left and I feel awful he is going to marry her never knowing that she cheated on him. I would tell him, but that would result in her life blowing up basically and she would self self-destruct. I basically have no contact with her anymore and nothing will ever happen with us again. Should I just keep my mouth shut and let their relationship be or should I tell him, which would come with the guilt of being the asshole who destroyed their relationship and her life?

 I went to visit her campus and her friend seemed nice but the other one didn't seem to like me very much, wouldn't talk much to me, etc. It could be because my girlfriend told them of the things I was saying to her, like accusing her of sleeping around with no real evidence. I feel like a huge asshole and have apologized tremendously. I have threatened breaking up with her before because it seems like she has been disinterested in the relationship through her text messages.

I've had a rotten relationship with my mom most of my life. She's been suffering from depression and borderline personality disorder and a slew of other issues since I was young. She's not gotten any better in years, actually she's gotten quite worse and I've come to resent her for it. We can't say nice things to each other, and I used to be quite afraid to speak with her when she would pick me up from school because I never knew if she was going to be ok or awful (I used to tell my friends it was like getting into the car with a snake in a box and I never knew if the box was unlocked).

Our relationship has been getting steadily worse. I thought it would get better when I left for school, which is half way across the country and I don't have to see her that often. But now instead of this awful stuff being spread out across the year it comes out in huge floods whenever I'm home.

I was diagnosed with depression a year or so ago and it's been really helping, like really really. But it's helped me realize some things I don't think I wanted to realize. My mother's relationship with me can slip into being emotionally abusive.

She has told me in front of large family gatherings that I need get a nose job. She has insulted me for the things I like and the people I like or for not going out and drinking or for going out to party too much. She has been flippant about my studies and about things I've achieved.She can't say a word without an insult. Worse, she blames a lot of her mental problems on me. When I was home in December we started fighting and it ended with me hiding in the closet in my foyer and her telling me that one day she would kill herself and it would be on my head.

She believes she's the best mom ever. All she ever does is shower me with compliments and mushy-gushy fondness. And when I deny these emotional advances because they make me feel uncomfortable, she attacks me and victimizes herself.

She doesn't believe she has done anything wrong and I don't believe she has done an of this maliciously, at least not cognitively. She doesn't understand why we have such a shit relationship, she thinks I don't want a strong relationship with her because of all of these shallow reasons, she doesn't understand it's because she quite honestly turns my stomach. 

Don't get me wrong, I love my mother. I just do not like her. At all. At all at all at all.

On the other hand, I have a great relationship with my dad. He'e my best friend and a really calming force in our household, something of a controversial point for my mother as she doesn't understand why I've built such a strong relationship with him and not her. My parents are still together and my dad is quick to call my mother out on her shit against either me or my sister [F18].

But I don't know what he thinks of our relationship. i know he would like it to be better, but I don't see that happening and I'm starting to think he does either.

My relationship with my mother can be classified as emotionally abusive, and I've come to terms with that. But, when I come home this summer (only staying for a week) I know I need to tell him what's what. And I don't know how to even start. And I don't know if he'll even believe me because I think that he sees the word abuse and thinks it's either sexual or physical, like how my grandad used to beat my mom and her sister. I don't know how to bring this up, but I think it's important for him to understand.

EDIT: I also worry that her threat to kill herself will be carried out should I make any move to inform anyone in my household that I feel abused in this sense. I suppose this in itself is part of the abuse but I can't get around it.

As a couple, we've made it through tough times before when we were both overworked/underpaid. In September 2014, we both moved away to Uni with good hopes of maintaining our relationship (She was a little worried). The first semester went well, didn't visit each other 'too much', mostly fortnightly or so and times together were special. 


Christmas and her December birthday went great, then she moved back down to Warwick for Uni (I don't go back to Sheffield until Sunday). During the rest of my break I went down to see her for a few days, and then on the last day before I left she told me she doesn't think we can do it, and suggested we leave each other for a few days to think. Her reasoning being along the lines that our time together over Christmas was great, and going back to uni she felt so lonely and doesn't want to feel like after every time we get to see each other. I worry for her and hate knowing that she is alone and upset, however I don't know what she has to think about. 

I've asked to have a proper Skype session tomorrow so we can talk about this (We've only been texting/brief phonecalls since the other day) but I really don't know what to say. 

I don't want to push her to stay with me if she doesn't want to, but I don't want her to break up with me for (what I think) is more an amalgamation of money/stress/work/nosleep troubles than a more simple relationship issue.

[Sorry in advance if this is long, skip down to the end for a quick summary, if you're interested read more]

This is my first post, I usually just browse, but I've been pretty confused lately and could use some of your perspectives. I'll start somewhere near the beginning:

I dated a guy, Matt, for 6 years, starting in college. We met studying abroad in the same program in Spain and quickly fell in love. We spent every night together. We traveled Europe together. We shared our fears with each other and it made us feel fearless.

  When we returned to Boston for our last year in college we were still inseparable. There were a few hiccups, mainly involving the unfortunate coincidence that I had previously (albeit briefly) dated his roommate, which caused his friend group to never fully accept or warm up to me.

  Anyway, things were great between us. We would smoke and play video games, order delivery and binge watch Netflix. It was not a productive relationship. We both skipped lots of classes and less than frequently went out with friends, but neither of us seemed to care because we were both so in love. When graduation rolled around we both realized that we had no idea what we wanted to do. Matt came to the decision that he wanted to move back home to his family in LA and, after some discussion and fear of the relationship ending, I decided to move with him.


  Fast forward a few years and some less important details, after living with him in LA and mostly hanging out with his friends (who for the most part I found unexciting), I met my best friend Courtney. It was refreshing to finally have my own friends again and I got swept up in the excitement of having a social life which he rarely joined since he worked long hours.


  Even though we lived together, we only got to hang out occasionally and when we did, he would complain about hating his job and I would complain about our roommates. Basically, we were both miserable when we were home and after four months of not having sex I suggested we take a break.


  Matt went crazy. He started reading my texts, checking my emails, crying, writing love letters, and it turned me off completely. In a way, I think such a strong emotional reaction from him forced me to fake being the stronger one and in turn I acted like a cold hard bitch. I moved out on my own and we broke up.


  Oh and did I mention we had a dog together? Although he begged me to keep her I refused, partly because I wanted to keep her and partly because I didn't want Matt to feel heartbroken and reminded of me every time he saw her. I felt like a monster. Like an evil witch who tore this guy's baby from his hands.


  Fast forward again to more recently. Over the course of about 3 years, I had casually dated other guys. Matt was always in my heart, but I was learning a lot about myself and having fun and I didn't think about getting back together with him.


  Matt and I saw each other about once a year and talked maybe a few times more than that. When I started to date one guy more seriously, I couldn't stop thinking about Matt. When we broke up, I felt relieved, but still did not initiate anything with Matt and definitely did not try to get back together.


  About a year ago, I met a guy, Kevin, through mutual friends. We hit it off instantly. He is smart, creative, handsome, and pretty much everything I could think to dream up in a man. We can stay up talking all night long and still have things to talk about over brunch the next day. We are compatible intellectually and this is so important to me. We are partners in adventure. We have fucking fantastic sex. He constantly challenges me and pushes me to be the best that I can. The only downside to Kevin is that he can be incredibly selfish and irritable if things aren't exactly his way. He's an only child, what can you expect. 


  Here is my dilemma: I am in love with Kevin, but I still think about Matt. A lot. And I miss him. A lot. I still love him. I don't think it's sexual, but definitely as a best friend. There are definitely things I get from Kevin that I never got from Matt. Kevin is amazing and the kind of man I can see myself being married to and I know that my life with him would be the best that it could possibly be.


  With Kevin I can be the greatest that I can possibly be.


  But there will always Matt. We spoke about 2 months ago and he sounded miserable. He was sad and lonely and when I told him I was seeing someone, he told me that he still loved me and still wanted me back. It was heart wrenching.


  I couldn't go back to Matt right now, even if that's what I thought was what I wanted to do. He has to find happiness on his own and out of fairness and goodness to him, I couldn't decide to get back together with him unless I was completely positive that that is what I wanted. Which I cannot confidently say that it is.


  But things with Kevin are moving fast. We are supposed to move in together and he has hinted to multiple friends that he is going to propose.


  I am so scared of making the wrong decision it is killing me. Part of me is tempted to avoid making a decision altogether right now and take a year for myself to write and travel around the world. Is that even feasible? Would I be running away from my problems? Is this a quarter-life crisis? Please help.


  As I'm sure I'm not the only one who has ever gone through this dilemma, I would really appreciate your perspectives, advice and thoughts. I am happy to provide more details if needed, but this post was getting long.


Thanks,

36151,Infidelity,342f9u,"        Hello all, this is my first post ever so I apologize if the text doesn't flow smoothly.
        I've been dating my current girlfriend for 11 months. About 4 months into the relationship she cheated on me during a girls night out. She seemed very apologetic, and I really liked this girl throughout high school so I wanted to make it work. Months go by and I still don't trust her, (probably due to my own self esteem). One night I drunk text one of our mutual female acquaintances that she went out with, the night that she cheated. I asked, why didn't you stop her, and if she had something against our relationship. She replied first to my SO while ignoring my texts. When the mutual friend finally did reply she stated, I don't like you, respect you, or want you with her. My girlfriend and I talked about what she said and she told me that You don't need to like her, shes my friend not yours. I don't know if I should end the relationship, but I can't ever trust her with that friend. Her friend always invites guys to girls nights out. Knowing that she willingly has a friend that disrespects me like that often makes me question if the relationship is worth it.

Some background (important) of us two. I dated him for 5 and a half years. Nothing was progressing in the relationship and it led to me wanting new things. A natural way of it I guess? He was very agreeable to it and so we split up and chose to just be good friends. It's been a year since. Just one year. In that year I have seen many people and only one who I had actually dated which only led to major heartbreak. All the while, my best friend was supportive and helped me through it as much as he could. 


We started hanging out more and not long after, we continued to sleep together and basically act how we were before. We weren't all lovey dovey or anything but we spent a lot of time together and kissed occasionally. Honestly, it's hard for me to imagine how else we would have acted... that's what we were used to.


Fast forward to today, we STILL are doing the same thing. He started hanging out with a somewhat mutual friend and ultimately asked her on a date. I found that the hard way. I got this feeling and had it for a week.... so, I snooped. Terrible, I know. I confronted him and he said he'd be completely honest about it. I just wanted honesty... I don't care what he does but honesty makes things better in the long run.


Last night, we were hanging out and I asked him what he was doing tonight. He said he had a lot of homework, etc. He made up this elaborate story of homework and how he needed to do it. He even said how he was supposed to hang out with his friend (the girl) but might have to wait. I had a weird gut feeling but it was so small I decided to trust him. After all, I knew this guy for years right? I was wrong. I woke up this morning and had a bad feeling all over again. I grabbed his phone and was thinking I wouldn't like this and he wouldn't either. Well, my suspicions were correct. He fucking lied, again. I felt numb. I felt hurt. Just yesterday we had amazing sex and had tons of fun playing games and hanging out. He can't even tell me the truth. I got up and asked him if someone lied, would he confront them. 


I'm pretty sure he knew what I was talking about... I told him and started crying. I said that I felt our relationship wasn't important anymore... that he said he'd just tell me the truth. 


I've had a lot of people tell me that I need to change the dynamics of our relationship. I agree... wholeheartedly but it's hard to do when it's what you've done for over 6 years now. I care about him so much, like unconditional love... but I feel like this relationship is toxic.


We've talked before and have established our importance to each other many times. Sometimes we still say we love each other... I mean, it's true! But I can't even tell if I'm over him emotionally or not.

Help me, Reddit. Tell me all the shit I don't want to hear because I'm tired of crying alone.

72656,Non-Romantic,1t4t71,"I've had issues with my parents, my mother in particular, being overbearing my entire life. As the youngest and only daughter, they have been very protective over me but their overbeaing-ness has only escalated over the years as I've had struggles with depression, anxiety and a chronic physical illness (which still allows me to live normally, although I do get very ill every once in a while). 

We have gone to therapy together a couple of times where they were told they were too overbearing and to relax their anxiety about me, but they often do not want to listen. They claim because I've been ill and had to drop out of uni for a semester once that I cannot handle situations. Also, because when I've broken up with boys and I've felt extremely upset (I've been left for another girl and cheated on which neither were easy) they assert that I cannot handle outside stressors. 

A year ago, I got pregnant by a guy I was dating and suffered a miscarriage. He left me for another girl and I was devastated. One night not long after it happened, I was visiting them in the US and I sobbed uncontrollably over it (but made it clear I was in no way going to harm myself) and needed to reach out to somone, so I called my parents. They then decided I was no longer allowed to stay home alone (I'm 28 and have been living away from them for most of my adult life) and cannot have friends over they do not pre-approve for my own protection. After visiting my therapist, they realized they had overreacted to what was a normal outpour of grief. 

Typically, I live in Europe whilst they are in the US and have been living abroad for almost three years. I have many friends and have settled down quite nicely with a guy and a dog (and although I've had the dog for 5.5 years and he's in great health, I still get lectured about how having a dog was a stupid idea).

Since I'm no longer home for my parents to control, they have turned to my facebook to speculate over posts and complain about. They would lecture me about posting things like WTF or at one point I made a post with the word damn in it and was told this was embarrassing and disrespectful to myself and inappropriate. This lead to me filtering my status a long time ago.

 A work colleague of mine (who is a guy around my age) put up a facebook status on my account about poop as a joke, which I had to delete immediately. It wasn't soon enough because I got a phone call from my brother (who could see my statuses) and parents (who had heard from my brother) about how this was inappropriate and that the family sees this and they cannot be embarrassed like that. I was also told I would never get a job if I posted things like that on Facebook (I have a job).

So I blocked them from my statuses. Things seemed to be going okay. I allowed pictures to be up since I live in a foreign country and I thought they would want to see what I'm up to. I've been careful not to post anything they would deem inappropriate or scandalous. 

Fastforward to today where I am visiting them. I was talking about getting together with some of the friends I have here and was wondering allowed why one person hadn't called me back and I hoped he wasn't avoiding me (I don't usually have interpersonal issues, but everyone gets anxiety every now and then). My mom told me he probably was avoiding me and when I asked why she said because my facebook is full of crude things and she's the only one who has the courage to say it. She claims she's sure my friends agree but are too nice to say anything. 

Since she's been blocked from most of my statuses, I asked her what the last thing was that I posted that was crude. She referenced the poop post, although she never saw it. She had to think about the last thing I posted which was crude, then told me that there was a picture of my boyfriend, housemate and dog on my bed watching television which she found inappropriate. There was also a picture of my boyfriend and one of his friends (who is also one of my friends) sitting on my bed which is also crude and inappropriate.

When I tried to stick up for myself and ask that she respect my decisions, I was told I don't understand how I'm disrespecting myself and embarrassing those around me (literally NO ONE else has ever said anything about my facebook posts and I'm very careful about who I filter things to). I told her I feel she treats me like a child, to which she, of course responded I do not! When I got angry and refused to hang out with her for the rest of the evening, she told me I didn't come here to fight. You're starting the fight and now you're ruining the little time we have together.

I ended up upstairs Skyping my boyfriend back in Europe and talking to a friend, both of which can see EVERYTHING I post on facebook and both were hard pressed to find any issues. My friend was shocked that my mom would call anything on my facebook crude.

I've deleted my mom from my Facebook. But this represents a larger issue I have. I have a lot of anxiety about whether or not I can do certain things in life because my parents always tell me they need to swoop in to fix things (they've told me they need to). We even got into a fight about my writing career because my mom wanted to edit my work (and edit out any reference to anything sexual to which I told her no). But it makes me feel as though I'm constantly being undermined, even though they maintain they always treat me like an adult. 

I don't want to block them on Facebook because I feel like it is a great way to share pictures, but this has become ridiculous. First, I had to block my statuses, then I had to block my wall because she thought my friends were posting offensive things (i.e. someone posting a picture in an album and then going through and looking at all the pictures in the album and saying that she found some of them inappropriate and why do I have friends that use foul language?) and now it's going to have to be a complete black out. 

Advice?

tldr: My parents have a long history of trying to control me and I live abroad now partially to escape this. After blocking my mom from the majority of my facebook posts, she continues to look for anything and everything to criticize and say is embarrassing to myself/her family (including a totally clothed and non-sexual photo of my boyfriend, housemate and dog on my made-up bed).

So my (now ex) fiance and I broke up 2 days ago after 3 years together. It was a mutual decision in the end. We were both unhappy with the situation. We were living at his parents. We broke our lease at our old apartment early... 

I had been thinking about leaving for a couple weeks. I had gotten so sick of the lack of communication and staring at the back of his head while he played video games with his friends on the headset. 

I expressed these feelings in my new journal he got me for my birthday and while I was at work he read it and wrote in it then let's pay the bills between us and settle this like adults. I won't sit and dwell and ache I was upset he read my journal and more so that he seemed so willing to give up our relationship. I started drinking beers...

He comes home and starts trying to hurt MD at first but finally he calms down and we both agreed we aren't happy with each other. We decide we are holding each other back. Our relationship is toxic. 

So my question is ... Since this was mutual and we both agree on breaking up, why does it hurt so much? When will the heartbreak stop? Why do I still care so much? It hurts every time I think of him. I feel like my chest may explode... When does this go away?

157712,Relationships,2bf1jm,"I want to start this out by saying that on almost every count other than what I'm about to describe, my boyfriend is amazing. He's kind, understanding, sweet, supportive patient, fun, responsible, loving, affectionate. My friends and family love him. I have my own faults too, like jealousy and insecurity (I'm in therapy for it), and he is incredibly patient with me. Every time I do something I'm not proud of, he reassures me that we can work it out together as a team. 

We're moving in together in 3 weeks. Over the weekend I was on a girls' trip and he texted me a lie about what he had done Friday night (hanging out in a group that included this girl I am jealous of). He wasn't actually doing anything bad that night, but I was being unreasonably jealous and I think he lied so that I wouldn't freak out. About 1 minute after he texted me the lie, he called me and confessed and profusely apologized. I was really mad at first, but we made up. I was glad he at least confessed right away.

When I got home from my trip, we talked about what happened, but something wasn't sitting right. After grilling him, I figured out some more pieces of the story he had omitted. I found out that she goes to his small boutique gym and that he has seen her there several times. That is definitely information he knows I would want to know. This process continues of me catching him in more and more lies. 

The next night we talk again and I catch him/he admits to a few more small lies. Just to be honest--none of the things he was lying about were actually that shady at this point. They were mostly related to things I was being unreasonable about that he was scared to tell me in case I got upset. 
After all this, I asked if I could look on his phone. I've never once snooped on him before, something I'm proud of. 

I searched his ex girlfriend's name in his email and see that they are emailing regularly. In February (after we had already agreed we were moving in together) she had sent him a link to a jokey porn. I couldn't see what he wrote back but I'm assuming he just deleted it. They emailed about every month. When I said something, he said ""There's a reason there is an email every month."" When I asked why he said it's because he owes her $9,000. Apparently his student loans had fallen through during a summer semester, and she paid for those classes and gave him a loan for expenses. They have a drawn up contract and he pays her by PayPal every month and she writes back to the emails sometimes. Most of the emails were pretty innocuous except for that one porn one. Aside from lying about the fact that he is in contact with her regularly, I'm also upset that he lied to me about his financial situation when we are about to move intogether. 

To be fair, I really don't think he has feelings for her or anyone else. He doesn't talk about her or see her, and I just don't get the sense that he misses her. He broke up with her about a year before we started dating, and I think they hooked up until about 6 months before we started dating. They went out for 3 years, but he says he never told her he loved her sober during that entire time, only when he was drunk. He said she gave him a deadline to tell her he loved her sober, and he missed it. He just doesn't seem into her like that. 

When I found this out I freaked out obviously. He blocked her on Facebook, Twitter and his phone, and only left the email open. He is coming into some inheritance in the next week or so, maybe even sooner. He said he would pay her in one lump sum and then block her on email too. He said I could go on his phone any time I want and make sure she is still blocked. 

He is really distraught, has apologized for everything and has promised to do whatever he can to make it better. He is really ashamed of himself for lying so much. He said he wants to marry me one day and will do anything not to lose me. 

I feel really confused right now. I know reading this you probably think I'm dumb for even considering staying with him, but I love him. He has always been so kind and gentle and patient with my feelings. We usually work on things together. I have my faults too. I can see why he would be afraid to tell me things. I'm working on them in therapy and considering medication. I love this man and can't imagine life without him. But I don't want to be stupid. What should I do?

My girlfriend and I have been dating for almost four months now and things recently have been pretty awful.  Our first three months together were literally perfect.  We saw each other almost everyday and went on dates very frequently.  It wasn't until she got a job that things started to go downhill.  She is 17 and going to be a senior in high school, and I am going to be a freshman in college.  She has said that I am unlike any other guy she's met.  She always wanted to be with me and never got tired of being around me.  She was very loving and was always affectionate towards me which reminded me how much she loved me and how much I liked her.

She told me very early on that she felt for me unlike the other two guys she has dated.  She told me that she loved me around two months into our relationship but I didn't love her yet.  I know I really liked her, and she understood that it would take time for me to develop the same feelings for her.

Continuing on, she got a job.  This is where the problems began.  Because I my class is from 10:00 am to 11:50 am, she asked to only work two or three days a week and to have the morning shift, which was 8:00 am to 4:00 pm.  She did this so we could have the evenings together a two or three days a week.  Though, after a week a working there, the managers switch her shift to the night shift which is from 4:00 pm to 11:00 pm, with cleaning after that takes about two hours.  On top of that, she is now working five to six days a week.  I never see her anymore.  She is acting different towards me.  She won't make the effort to see me, she isn't as loving as she used to be, and we are constantly fighting.  She has a very weak immune system and the medicine she takes to help it makes her very sleepy.  She sleeps from 2 am to 1 pm everyday she works.  She can't make the effort to see me because she is too tired.  She is unhappy all of the time, stressed out, and wants to be alone all of the time.  I told her I feared she was just slowly burning herself out and she was going to just break down eventually.  I told her she wasn't making enough time for the people who make her happy - her family, friends, and myself.  She just shrugs it off like I'm spewing shit from my mouth.

She has the power to change her hours and to take less days a week.  But she won't do it.  It bewilders me why would not want to be happy.  When fall comes, she will be even more busy with school, tutoring, online classes, and work.  She's afraid things work out between us.  I feel like deep down she has already made the decision to break up with me but won't do it.  So, after our lunch yesterday and another argument, I decided the best thing to do was to just take a break.  I love her very much and would give the world to her, but I am not getting the same in return from her.  She has told me that now isn't the right time for her to have a boyfriend, but she loves me like no one else and it would rip her apart to lose me.

Her definition of a break was that we were still seeing each other, but it wasn't official.  She promised me she would not see any other guys, and that she still wanted us to say we love each other.  Fast forward to today, and she has taken me out of her Instagram profile and deleted our pictures together.   When I saw that, my heart literally fell to the floor.  Why would she be deleting our pictures together and taking me out of her bio if we were still seeing each other?   I texted her about it this morning and she said:

 Being in a relationship right now isn't a good idea right now for me.  If I can't make myself happy right now how am I supposed to make someone else happy as well?  But that being said, I know I love you because I have thought about you nonstop and I don't want to stop seeing you or anything.  You literally are my other half.  I don't know how to make you understand. 

  I am just at a loss for words right now.  I feel like she is taking the cowards way out, by slowly distancing herself from me and taking low blows at me so I am the one to break up with her.  I don't know what to do.  She means the world to me.  I'm sorry if this is all jumbled, but my heart feels like a 50 pound dumbbell right now.

I've been living with my girlfriend for a bit less than three years. She's insanely busy with her work (I'm talking about at least 12-14 hours a day, plus half of her weekends). It started two years ago and I thought I was going to be the supportive boyfriend. The first year was a bit hard, but I was holding on the fact she told me it was temporary. Frankly, I was not 100% perfect as a supportive boyfriend, but I tried to do my best.

Last year I realized that we had less and less things in common and the first thoughts of leaving her arrived. It was very cyclic. Sometimes she was the love of my life, sometimes I could not see myself with her anymore. Since I care a lot about my girlfriend, I tried everything to salvage this relationship. Romantic getaways, small gifts, trying to find more activities together (recently I convinced her into hiking), doing the housework when she's busy, etc... Then of course the sexual activites faded. I'm a person with a high sex drive and I kinda accepted that our bedroom will be alive during weekends only, and not all the time. 

One year later, here we are. She was supposed to be busy until end of August, now end of September and she starts giving me hints the situation might continue until mid October, because her job does not hire enough people. Of course, she is burned out and depressed. We fight a lot. I feel that on the top of the regular fights a couple have, we got so much more things piling up do to her insane working habits. Here is an example.

I start dating a healthy and full of life young woman, now she's the shadow of herself. She developped allergies, back issues, sleep disorders, has lot some weight... I tried to address this problem as gently as possible, but she keeps delaying her visit to the doctor. To give you an idea on how serious the situation is, here is a story. There was a time she was working late from home and she told me she felt really bad and had trouble breathing. I told her in this case we should go to the ER. She then said she needed a bit of time to prepare, since it wasn't that bad. I was thinking she was talking about changing clothes or something similar. Ten minutes later I check on her and she was actually sending a last email to her work. She almost choked on her computer and we had to rush to the nearest hospital in pajamas at two in the morning. The weekend after the event, I tried to talk to her about this and we ended up figthing, because apparently I can't tell her how to live her life. 

Another short example. I went for a three-weeks trip with some friends. When I came back she told me she really missed me so she worked hard to have her Sunday off. She even came to the airport to pick me up at 6 in the morning. I suddenly hoped that she finally decided to take it a bit more easy. Maybe she could even see her family a bit more. On the way home, the tells me she won't be there half of the day to attend the birthday of her manager's son. One part of myself was absolutely furious about this while the other part was ashamed of myself: how could I be mad while she was obviously making efforts? But I guess this was too little, too late.

Recently, I also realized that my whole life with her is tuned to her schedule. Since she got so little time, I can't decide when we'll do things. If she feels like sleeping on Saturday, we have to do it. But if I want to stay home and get lazy, I can't because I won't have any other opportunity to do something with her before a while. I guess that what got me tired too... I feel like I always have to be at 100% while seeing her, since I'm not having that much time with her. But on the other hand, she does not have to be like this, since the got the whole working hard excuse. 

Anyway, I think you get the picture now. My girlfriend, a woman I do love and who loves me, is pushing herself too hard. She will be a successful person, probably richer than me. Maybe she'll even be super happy later in her life while I hate myself for not being with her. But I don't want to be with her anymore. I want to live with someone who enjoys life as I do. I'm not ready to be with an old person. I quietly prepared the whole thing but I think I dropped some hints, without knowing it. She keeps telling me how her life would be so sad without me and she's very happy I'm here for her. I feel guilty about leaving her when she's working too hard, because I know she will have to find a new place, get adjusted, etc... But I also know that's not fair to her to remain like this. She won't have any issue to find someone else. My birthday is early November and I want it to be done Mid-October, because I don't want her to spend money on an expensive gift. 

**tl;dr: my girlfriend insane working hours created a rift between us and I can't stay anymore. However, I don't know how to break up with her while she's so busy. If someone lived a similar situation, I would really appreciate the help. Thanks**

I understand that it's normal to have female friends and that he wants to go to parties and hang out with his peers. But I get extremely sad and jealous. I was able to be normal when we were physically together, but now that we're in a long distance relationship (he is on the other side of the world), everything is overblown. I know I'm being paranoid and insecure, but how do I reassure myself and not get jealous? Just the other day, he met up with a couple of former high school classmates (we are college students) and one of them included his ex. I don't want to tell him how much it bothered me, but it did. 

So how do I become less jealous?

A girl in my class mentioned she cuts hair, I needed a cut and I was/am interested so I asked her where she works and went in the next day. We had a typical conversation during and after, but I didn't want to ask her out where she worked. Before leaving she gave me a card and wrote her name on the back with a heart after it which I took as a positive sign since I already knew her name since she is in my class and it is printed on the front of the card.

So later that day I text her thanking her for the cut, and she replies back with saying she is glad I liked it. I then text back asking if she would like to get dinner, and she never replies. This seemed really strange to me as I don't think she would do that. 

So after thinking about possible reasons for it, I thought that maybe the card wasn't hers and is her boss's card, meaning the cell number I texted wasn't her. I decided to do a Facebook search of the name on the card and I am pretty sure that I am right: the cell number is for her boss or another employee, and they just happen to have the same first name.

So now my question is what should my next step be? I can think of 3 options. 1: text the number again asking if it is her. 2: wait until I see her after spring break in class. Or 3: go back to where she works and find out in person.

I am leaning towards option 3, but I am not sure if that is the best option.

**Tl;dr**: Probably mistook the number for hers when it was her boss's. Asked her out and got no reply. Course of action?

**Edit:** I realized there was a way for me to find out her last name since we are classmates. Turns out I was right, the cell number isn't hers. For now my plan is to stop by her work and clear things up; maybe apologize to the person I did text if they are there, as well. I have a couple unrelated questions anyway.

131658,Infidelity,1idets,"Sorry this is kind of long, but I really need to get the facts out.  First I'll give you all a brief introduction to these two guys.

Guy 1: We'll refer to him as A from now on.  A was the one who I was in a relationship with when I fell in love with Guy 2.  I met him my freshmen year of college and we've been in a relationship since then.  We live together but he's spending the summer with his terminally-ill sister.  I tried to go with him but he told me that he would be spending most of his time at the hospital and that his parents only wanted family or close friends of hers to be with her.  I decided to spend some time with my family back home while I looked for internships. My relationship  with A was very solid although nothing spectacular.  We were comfortable with each other and we loved each other very much but there wasn't a real passion.  It was more like a partnership.  

Guy 2: We'll refer to him as B from now on.  This guy was my first real boyfriend.  I lost my virginity to him in highschool. We dated for a little more than two years.  I really loved him a lot and he loved me too.  Even factoring in all of the crazy shit he did in high school he was by far the sweetest boyfriend I've ever had.  Here's a story that I think demonstrates how sweet this guy is: for my Sweet 16 he bought me a car. That wasn't the sweet part.  No one in our town was especially rich but his family was clearly worse off than most others.  While most kids our age were getting allowances to have fun with he was forced to pay for things on his own.  When I asked him how he got the money he revealed that he had been saving up all of his cash from work and sold 75% of his Baseball cards.  It wasn't a luxurious car by any means but it was my car that my boyfriend bought for me and I thought he was amazing.  Obviously, this happened while things were still good in our relationship.  By Junior year he had become obsessed with getting good grades, making varsity lacrosse, etc.  I thought he was becoming really shallow and it got to the point where he was taking drugs to motivate himself.  I tried to get him to stop but he wouldn't.  He started hanging out with really shady people and I broke it off with him.  He begged me not to leave him but I really didn't have much to say.  I explained to him that he had to get his shit together before any girl would want to be with him.  After a couple months he told me that he hadn't used drugs since that day and he showed me a chart of daily drug tests that his parents made him take to prove it.  I was really proud of him but I still didn't want to be with him. When I told him that he stopped talking to me for the rest of high school

So after high school B ended up going to Wharton (which was a big deal in our small town).  Last month he came back with his Bachelors and everyone made a huge fuss for him.  One of our friends from High School threw a giant welcome back party and practically invited the whole town.  I ended up going just to see how he was doing.  When I arrived to the party he was making some sort of speech about how much he's missed everyone and how amazing his undergrad experience was.  It was pretty uninteresting but everyone else seemed really excited.  I met up with some of my old girlfriends (at this point I had been back in town for about 2 days) and they were all talking about how cute he was.  One of the guys told us that he was single which caused a lot of these girls to start approaching him.  At this point I decided to leave.  Obviously I had no intention of trying to ""get with him"" like the other girls but as I was making my way out, B ended up stopping me.  At first I felt the situation was pretty awkward but he didn't seem to care. He asked me how I've been doing and we did the small talk thing for a little while until I realized I was touching his arm.  The entire situation felt really awkward so I told him that it was nice to see him and quickly left.

A couple days later he started messaging me on Facebook.  The messages were innocent enough.  It was generally just more small talk with him throwing in a couple of jokes.  I realized that B had his life on track and knew exactly what his plan was for the next 5 years (unlike A).  He told me about his summer plans in NYC and how he was leaving town the next day.  I was really impressed with how well he's matured and when I told him that on Facebook he started steering the conversations towards more intimate topics.  After about a week of our back and forth on Facebook, I ran into him at our town's only coffee shop (sort of inevitable).  I saw him get this really wild grin when he noticed me and we ended up talking for 3 hours.  At this point, I was extremely attracted to him.  He was handsome, smart, and kind.  I began to hope that he retained how sweet he was (basically what made me fall in love with him in high school).  I started touching his arm again (this time intentionally) and he asked for my phone number so he could call me while he was NYC.  I convinced myself that we were just old friends and I wrote down my number for him.

While he was in New York, we started talking less and I realized I kind of missed him.  I remember picking up the phone the first time he called me and basically begging **any** higher power that it was him.  When I heard his voice I nearly dropped the phone.  He told me that he was going to be back in town this weekend to pick up some stuff that he had forgotten and he asked if I wanted to hang out while I was back.  Again, I convinced myself that there was nothing more than a friendship (although my desperation should have clued me in).  He already knew my parent's address (I was staying with them) and when he came that Saturday my mom was completely shocked.  She knew about A and how he was currently spending time with his sister but I could tell she wanted me to start a relationship with him. I was surprised to see him too since we hadn't made formal plans just an indefinite invitation to ""hang out"".  He told me he wanted to take me somewhere special and I was starting to realize that I was leading him on.  Regardless, I left with him still trying to convince myself that nothing wrong was happening.  

He took me to a burger joint.  It was the place where we had our first date.  I remember him trying to act cool in front of me and I teased him about it.  I joked about him still being a dork even after all these years.  Anyways, we ended up having lunch together and he offered to take me to New York and show me around the city.  I said yes without even thinking.  After lunch we just drove around town and talked/laughed until the day was over.  He told me that there was some sort of party in New York for friend's company the next Friday and he asked if I wanted to go with him.  Again, I said yes without even thinking.  You all can probably tell that most of this happened without me thinking at all.  Eventually he parked his car right in front of my house and he commented on how different things were now and I kissed him.  I kissed him without thinking.  Then, I got hit by a fucking truckload of common sense.  I pulled away, secretly freaked out about the silly smile he had on his face, and ran into my house.  I guess he didn't know what happened and he tried calling me 4 times that night.

So throughout this, I had been talking to A and telling him about meeting B again and how much he's changed.  A was never really the jealous type and he had no reason to believe I would do anything to hurt him.  He was soooo wrong.  I felt ridiculously guilty after the kiss and I immediately called A to tell him.  He was really sweet and caring about it and he told me that he forgave me because he knew that the kiss didn't mean anything and I had been completely honest with him.  Then I told him that I was starting to fall back in love with B.  I told him that I wanted to take a break because of my feelings for B.  That's when A got mad.  He got REALLY mad.  I wasn't sure if he was mad at me or at B but he hung up on me and I felt even worse.  

The next day, B showed up at my parent's house again but this time I was the only one home.  I knew that I really wanted a relationship with him and I didn't know whether he should know about A or not.  Anyways, B and I are sitting on my couch and he pulls out a slip of paper out of his wallet.  It's the piece of paper that I wrote my phone number on back in high school.  Neither of us mentioned the kiss at this point but I planted another one on him right there.  I saw how happy he was again and I started to feel really guilty.  So I told him.  I told him about A and how I had technically cheated on him.  I told him how I had broken up with A for him. I hoped he wouldn't mind.  I hoped he would be happy that I was interested in him (just as he was clearly interested in me). Nope. B didn't look mad he just looked upset.  He asked me why I hadn't told him about A.  I didn't really know what to say so he left.

And that's where we are now.  A is still pissed but in all honesty I don't care that much.  I know that sounds bad but it's the truth.  I do however care a lot about B.  I texted, tweeted, and messaged him on Facebook multiple times but he's largely ignored me.  What should I do?  I know that I really messed up with these two guys but I seriously did not intend on hurting anyone.  Once I realized that I had developed serious feelings for B I cut things off straight away with A.  Is that good enough?  What can I do to show B that I care about him?  What can I do to make A feel better about this situation?

I just returned from a week long vacation I their primary residence to catch a ride with them back home. I have only been home 3 hours and my father has already made three homophobic remarks. The first was during a discussion about the Zimmerman trial where he labeled the judge as a ""dyke"" when discussing her apart bias. Then, he was relaying to my mother a meeting of one if his relatives kids at a funeral, referring to one of them as sounding ""feminine, but not the gay kind"".

I let these comments slide, as I tried very hard this week to build a determination to no longer be bothered by these things, not be manipulated or guilted by my parents, etc. when we reached a rest stop just now, however, I couldn't hold my tongue any longer after this: I walk out of the bathroom and greet him as we wait for my mom and he motions to the ""unisex"" labelled bathroom saying, ""why shouldn't I be able to have my own bathroom if I want? Why should I have to use the stall next to everyone else? I tried to open it, but the door was locked."" When I responded to him saying that I wasn't sure why they even have those considering the combined stalls are large enough to accommodate the handicapped, he responded with, ""it's the gay way.""  Now, I could have controlled myself more but I said ""what the fuck does that have to do with anything?""  Well, he did not like that. He gave me that look and said something along the lines of ""come on, what do you think it's for?"" I got so flustered that he would jump to such an asinine conclusion about it being something to accommodate the gay community. I told him he mentioned gays three separate times since I've been home and talks about them more often than even the gay community. Then, he told me I'm pissing him off. I left and vented to my mother who just told me to ignore him if he counties the topic. 

He tries to tell me all the time that he has nothing against gays and the he's not bigoted, yet he makes homophobic and racist remarks all the time. He once told me when I was younger that we should gay men and gay women on their own separate islands and let them die out. 

I moved here for college on the premise that I would be paying nothing so I could save. It was quickly changed to $400 then $600 which does include my car an cell phone, etc. When I was ready to start school, he got a DUI and I had to cancel my registration because they couldn't help me with tuition. I will not be in the position to move for at least a few months. Also, my mom will be heading backbone on Sunday, but my dad will be staying for the entire week.

My fraternal (don't look alike) twin sister (“Alex”) and I are very close. When one of us has a best friend, that best friend is also the other person’s best friend. Then we are like a lil’ trio of friendship. Since ninth grade, “Emily” was the best friend in our trio. We had other very close friends, but Emily was undoubtedly one of our closest friends. I met Emily freshmen year through a school activity we both did. Alex had a class with Emily in middle school, so we became buddies with her. Emily gets our sense of humor and we can be weird and giggly with her.


Alex joined the school activity in 10th grade. That same year, I was hospitalized in a psych ward at 15 y/o (I wasn’t taking my anti-depressants and was planning to kill myself but then I was like lets not do that so I got myself in) and I called her every night. After that the three of us got even closer.


Things started to change sometime senior year. All three of us quit the activity, but remained best friends. Emily got her first boyfriend, but we liked him a lot. Emily had always been sassy, but sometime during senior I started feeling like I was walking on eggshells with whatever I said. If I had a new, weird interest, I would hold my breath when I shared it with her, waiting for her to either say “That’s stupid” or “That’s cool!”. 


We hung out the summer after we graduated, and texted and called all through our first year at college, where we all made new friends. Alex and I go to the same school three hours north of where we live, Emily going to a school one hour north of where we live. We visited Emily once, and she visited Alex and I twice. Emily and her high school boyfriend broke up, and she started dating one of her new college friends, “John”. Alex and I really like John. Alex made a really small group of friends at college that John was apart of. I knew that if she and John ended, that friend group would crumble.


After our first year of college, Emily revealed to us that her grades weren’t good and she was getting treatment for depression. We tried being supportive but she didn’t really want to talk about it.


The last time we spoke to Emily in person was in June, when we invited her, John, and a bunch of other friends to our beach house. Alex was leaving for a study abroad thing that would last all summer in two weeks. I gave Emily and John the master bedroom. The second night was when the drinking started. Emily is very small, but likes to drink like she isn’t. This lead her to becoming very intoxicated that night. When every one went to bed, I was all cuddled up sleeping on the couch on the first floor. John kept going up and down the stairs, grabbing paper towels and not saying anything. After the third time he came down, I asked what was going on and he said Emily was throwing up everywhere and I told him I would help. I came upstairs and it was so sour smelling. Emily threw up undigested pasta and booze all over the bed and in and around the toilet, getting a bunch in this carpet pad around the toilet. She was on the floor without any pants on, thumping her head against the wall, moaning and saying sorry, but also giggling when I was trying to wrap her up in a blanket. John and I cleaned everything up. I tried washing the sheets but I had to throw them out. She apologized, but if anyone over the week tried poking light harded fun at her over the whole thing, she would get pissy and defensive.  This same thing happened when we visited her at her college, she got so drunk and Alex and I stayed up much of the night so she could throw up in garbage bags. Alex and I drink but we don't do it to the point where we throw up and have to be treated like toddlers.


Also during the trip, Emily was rude and mean to John, who is so sweet. He would try to show her affection, but she would make a face and push him away. She was also rude to him. Everyone on the trip was uncomfortable with her behavior. She also got rude when the group didn’t want to do what she wanted to do.


Additional thangs:
*I have been confused with my sexuality since I was around twelve. I know, in the end, labels don’t matter, but for my personal brainspace, I, for now, call myself bisexual. I didn’t really settle on this until the last few months. Emily once made the comment our senior year that bisexuality wasn’t “real”, that you were either gay or straight, and kind of put on a mocking voice when she said bisexuality. I never said anything to her, because no one knew, besides my parents, that I was confused with my sexuality. What she said made me antagonize about it even more, even though I know that sexuality is fluid and what she said isn’t true at all.
*Emily makes mean comments she writes off as jokes about other races, specifically Hispanic people. In Emily’s “jokes”, if you are brown and speak Spanish, you are Mexican, and if you are Mexican, you are lazy. What really stands out in my mind that can show this is a comment Emily made when Alex and I visited her at college last year. We went to Mcdonalds with her and her friends off campus at around 8pm. There was a Hispanic family sitting in the both behind us, speaking in Spanish and eating together. Emily said something like “Look at that, a typical Mexican family”. I was angry and embarrassed by what she said, on so many levels (I’m white but not an asshole. Emily is also white). I must have given her a dirty look, because she said, kind of accusingly, “Why are you giving me that look?”. I panicked and apologized, knowing that if I send anything about the comment she would get pissy. I know she picks this up from her dad, but that really isn’t an excuse. 


So after that beach trip my sister left and I was all alone that summer. I didn’t really talk to Emily, as Alex and I discussed how we have been angered by her behavior for a while. I hung out with some college friends who I knew from high school and friends I made from college, chilled around the house, and worked. 
In October, we got a message from Emily saying she missed us and apologizing for anything she did and she wanted to see us. She didn’t go back to her college after the summer (presumably because of her bad grades), was working fulltime, living at home, and both her and John’s Facebook relationship statuses were set to single. We kind of got the feeling she wanted to visit us at school, but we told her we could meet over Thanksgiving break. Well, yesterday we made plans with her to get Chipotle. She is going to pick us up around 5. I want to tell her why we haven’t been talking to her without being a jerk and making her cry. 
If you told me a year ago that she wasn’t our best friend anymore, I would have laughed. Now…. I wouldn’t care if she were in my life or not. I feel bad that she doesn’t really have any friends with her around our hometown, and she really helped me through my depression, but I just don’t know. She is going to start going to community college this upcoming semester and will still be at home.

We had sex the last night and it was horrible in my book, I felt like it can't even be saved and it made me realize that I didn't even want to try and save it. I realized in that moment that I just don't like him.

So I called him and broke it off, explaining that it wasn't him, there just was something missing on my part. 

He basically begged me to give him another chance, blamed the sex, kept asking what I did wrong. And I'm still getting texts from him even though I asked him to leave me alone. 

Finally I deleted him from social media and he sent me some text messages flipping out at me and telling me that I didn't give him a chance and was a liar. 

I don't know what to do from here. I thought I did the right thing by not wasting any more of his time. I guess I just stop replying now and let it fizzle out? Been about 3 weeks now since I dumped him.

So I'm a 18m, i just finished my sophomore year attending college, and I have a job as a student worker, and at a local grocery store. To be perfectly honest, I'm a cold analytical, logic based person, who is total honest and brutally realistic. I know I'm permanently in the friend zone with this chick.


I was homeschooled, and I haven't had a girlfriend, or even kissed a girl. I'm really lonely, I have a shitty home life (time for that in a different post) and only a few friends. 

There's this girl (21f) who works right next to my dept. at college, and I occasionally work in that dept if my boss has nothing for me. She is awesome, smart, funny, hot, and she gets me. no this isn't my first crush.

I decided to make my move, got all dolled up, walk in to talk to her, she runs up to me and says guess what? 

Me: what?

Her:I got together with my crush today! I'm so Happy! 

Me:oh.... That's great.

I was sad, but I don't feel things deeply (for example: (when I was 13) we had to get rid of my first dog, I cried for 5 minutes, and then I was fine). so I decided, I still wanted her as a friend. And I decided to use this to better myself. Get back into track, wear better clothes, start working out, take better care of myself. basically, taking a page from the good ol' reddit hit the Facebook, gym up, and delete the lawyer. I don't go on facebook much, and I don't need a lawyer, so gym up it is. 


Mistake: Then my genius of a brain decided to ask her to run with me, she said yes, and wanted to take her boyfriend with us, too. I think I'm going to abandon running with her, and do it solo. But I like running with a partner, and none of my other friends want to. Ugh. No my uni doesn't have a track club, before someone suggests it. No I can't start one. My job precludes me from being a president of any clubs. 

I've been trying to focus towards meeting new ppeople (read that here) rather than just girls. But I can't. I don't have hobbies. The hobbies I do have are single person/professional development. I master a subject, then drop it. 

The other day, I saw her and her boyfriend kissing, and that hurt. that is what I can't forget. I can control everything else, but walking towards my car and seeing them is still in my mind. Am I being weird?

122484,Relationships,28nj7m,"A little background -

My boyfriend and I have been best friends since 2011 and he's always had depression. 
It's never bothered me; I always listen to him and let him vent-- sometimes it's even channeled towards me, 
but I always know it's just the buildup inside of him and not what he really thinks.





We started dating about a year ago and it's been wonderful. We love eachother very 
much and would never leave eachother even if we broke up, but he has regular cycles 
of depression kind of like a girl PMSing. I know exactly when it's about to happen and it 
happens at the same time every month; I even know the exact time he'll be super loving 
and sweet every month. I told him I think he has a hormonal imbalance and he agreed to alert 
his doctor within a week.
 





The part that really bothers me is that at the same time every month in his depressive 
stage, he mentions breakup among other usual things (such as his weight, financial 
problems, career path, ect). I know he only says it because he's very emotionally low and 
thinks I deserve better, but I want nothing more than to be with him and help him through 
these times. The most recent episode he had, he actually did break up with me, but a 
few hours later he recalled it saying it wasn't fair to me. I think he realized it wasn't what 
he really wanted. He says all the time how I'm the best girlfriend he's ever had by far.
 





In my opinion, the monthly low-- trying to get rid of me, is just him directing his depression 
towards something good in his life. I've had extreme depression twice and I remember my 
first thought was to get rid of the best thing in my life at the time. I don't know why. It's
 just what depressed people do. It's irrational and only depresses someone further. 
 





I want to know what I can do to help him. The next time he is supposed to get depressed is 
about the 11th of next month and I want to be ready to help direct his depression in a different 
way. I don't know how though. He's going to a psychiatrist and I'm hoping that will help but I 
know it mostly takes his own willpower to get himself through it. What should I do reddit? 
Sometimes I think I should step back during his depressed days, but that might cause him 
to get more depressed. 
 





I hope his doctors find out if he has a hormonal imbalance. If that gets balanced than he should 
feel a lot better. I only suggest that because that's what happened to me and I got rebalanced 
over the course of a few months and then I was off the medicine. I love him so much and I 
just want him to be happy. I'll always be there for him even if the break up does go through 
next time but I really want him to get feeling better.
 





That was kind of long but thanks for any help you guys give me.
 





Oh and I'm not breaking up with him. I just wanted to say that because I know a lot of people 
in /r/relationships make that the very first option in their comments. Why would I leave him for 
one reason when I have a million reasons to stay? Anyway, I just wanted to throw that in there. 
I love him very much. :)

To make matters worse he works off shifts and often gets home between 10pm-4am. I get up at 5:15 for work. 

I'm a light sleeper, even more so since having my son. There are nights where my husband wakes me up 7+ times. It's worse on the nights he works and gets home in the middle of the night. 

I am exhausted. I can't take the snoring anymore (on top of everything else, but I feel like those issues I got ""used to"" and they don't always bother me). I fall asleep on my train ride too and from work, almost every day, I can't help it. Sleeping on the train sketches me out and I know it's not really safe. I'm tired at work.

19244,Relationships,2uddws,"I'll try to be as brief as possible with this. My girlfriend is a classmate from high school a long time ago. About a year and a half ago, we reconnected at a mutual friend's wedding and immediately hit it off. What started as a friendship turned into more, though neither of us were looking for it. After going on-and-off for a while, we finally sat down and agreed we couldn't ignore our feelings for each other anymore.

She has a professional job that keeps her very busy between January and April. She and I agreed that we'll hang out together when we can during that time, and get serious when April's over. I made one thing clear, however... if we do this, then it's gotta be the real deal. We come as a pair. I invite her to my things, she invites me to hers. She said she'll have to get used to that after not being in a relationship for years (she had a messy divorce when she was in her 20's), but she'll try.

Things have been great so far. When we're alone, she's more attentive and cuddly than she's ever been. She opens up to me in a way she hasn't be able to in the recent past (with me or anyone). She texts me every day.

There's just two things that are bothering me: one, she has a lot of friends and gets invited to a lot of things, none of which she invites me along to. Tonight, she's wearing a beautiful cocktail dress for some gala function. Last weekend, she went to hang out with her best friend L and L's husband. I don't expect to be immediately involved in every aspect of her life yet, but she invites me to literally zero of her social functions. Back when we were FWB, she at least invited me to *some* of them. Now, none.

The second was a Facebook post she made today (this is the then this happened part). It was a picture of flowers sitting on her car passenger seat commenting, Flowers given to me by the cashier at lunch today.

So I'm not sure how I should feel. I'm a little jealous about the flowers and wish she'd invite me out to her social functions. I understand that this has been an adjustment for her, so I'm trying to give her space and time to adjust. But the public display of flowers she got from another dude, however innocent, has me feeling jealous. And I'm afraid to make waves while the relationship is just starting to get off the ground.

Do I approach her with how I'm feeling? Give her more time? Something else? I'll try to answer any questions asked to give more detail.

It had been the first time we saw each other in over a week, and her innocent fun stories turned not so innocent right before she had to leave.


I asked my girlfriend to see her phone before she left, and I asked her about a guy's name I didn't recognize in her inbox.  The only thing my girlfriend can tell me is that he was the guy who gave her one of his old pipes.  I felt something was very odd when that was all she had to tell me, so I opened the conversation and proceeded to read.


All of my girlfriend's outgoing texts were missing, supposedly due to an issue with her phone.  Over the course of a week, the incoming texts from this Guy slowly built up to asking if my girlfriend would like to be picked up.  I then asked my girlfriend if she hung out with this guy and she tells me that he went to the beach with her.


Afterwards, my girlfriend proceeded to grab her stuff and head to the door.  She almost left when I said ""you're not even going to give me a kiss?""  My girlfriend normally hugs and clings to me until she is late before even making it the door.  I was in shock that she neglected to tell me about this Guy when she told me about getting a new pipe and going to the beach.  I was also shocked at how much her behavior changed after I asked her about this Guy.


I have access to my girlfriend's facebook accounts so I did some research on him.  I discovered that they were not facebook friends on either of her accounts until exactly two weeks ago when this Guy sent her a message to text him with his phone number.  There was a little bit of chatting during a month back in 2012, but other than that, they were complete strangers from what I found.


I talked with my girlfriend later that night and asked her a little more about this Guy to see who he was other than someone who gives away free pipes.  My girlfriend goes on to tell me that they were really good friends and used to hang out a lot.  They've been in communication here and there, and it was really nice to see him again.


My heart sank hearing my girlfriend lie right to my face.  They were not communicating on facebook, nor were they communicating by phone because he didn't have my girlfriend's number until two weeks ago.  They weren't good friend's because my girlfriend posted on his wall last week that she thinks he's a great guy even though she doesn't know him thaaaat well.


My girlfriend and I have been arguing about this quite a bit lately.  I held firm on the position that she was hiding this Guy from me because I would not have found out anything about this Guy if I didn't see her texts and ask her about it.  These are her arguments:

* I didn't tell you because we didn't have enough alone time

* I didn't tell you because you were going to find out anyway

* You should have asked me when I told you about the pipe

* I assumed you didn't know so I told you so you'd know (in other words: I told you about him already)

* I just plain didn't think about it, can't you just accept that answer?

* I didn't hide it but that doesn't mean I didn't end up looking like I meant to


Her arguments are invalid because:

* We spent at least two hours driving around, running errands, and shopping

* She could have easily told me about him when she told me about getting a pipe and going to the beach

* Ignorance does not fly with me when it comes to cheating

* Hitting someone's car is still hitting someone's car even if the driver didn't mean to.


I worry so much because if she can't even tell me the truth about this, what else could she be hiding from me.  There is a lot of lost trust.

Anyway, lately we've been fighting over something, and the issue itself isn't what I want to talk about, my communication skills are. I'm awful with confrontation, and when I get emotional it gets even harder for me to try to figure out what I want to say. So much so that I don't even know how to tell how I'm feeling sometimes. This is made even worse by the fact that he raises his voice and swears a lot when he gets really angry. 

When I'm upset, I want to talk it to death to deal with it. He more of the ""fix it"" type. He wants to figure out what he can do to fix it, and then be done with it. That's really difficult for me because if I bring up something with the intention of talking about it, I don't feel like it can ever be just a talk. I really appreciate that he's so willing to work on any problems we have, but he'll say things like ""we're done talking about this"" and I feel kind of shut down. It doesn't feel resolved to me, but I'm not going to directly go again something he said so clearly. It would feel really disrespectful to him.

About two weeks ago I started going out with this young lady monitor, and everything's been swell so far. Everything, except for this one guy she works with (another monitor). He's had a crush on her for a long time, longer that I've known her, and she knows it. He keeps asking her out, telling her she shouldn't be with an other guy, and yesterday tried to kiss her.

Now, I'm a regular, mostly nice guy.

I don't like conflict. That's why we're keeping our relationship a secret from the other people working there. But here's the problem: my girlfriend's been assaulted last year by her ex-boyfriend, and now she's panicking because she thinks this guy will get mad and try something stupid. But when he's not trying anything, he's a nice enough guy to be friendly with him. 

How should I approach this? How do I tell him to fuck off, but without destroying what little rapport they have left? They're working together, taking care of deaf, blind or mentally challenged people, so if they start hating each other, it's not gonna end well. I'm in no way intimidating, and I don't know if he would take me seriously if I just went and talked to him straight.

(Also, he asked her if she was going out with me, and she said no, for the sake of the secret. He'll be even more mad that we lied to his face like that.)

**THE REAL TL;DR:** Met a girl on a party. She thought I wanted to black her out and do whatever I want. I apologized, she accepted. Met her month and half later on another party. She was really talkative, she even complimented me. I wrote to her on FB, but her responses are damn short and emotionless. What shall I do?



Once I was at a party. I met there Sandra basically for first time (we didn't know eachother pretty much). We got drunk etc, and she may have gotten feeling that I wanna make her blackout just to do whatever-i-want with her. Don't want to get into the details since I don't think it matters that much. Anyways, I didn't plan it to be that way, so after this party I apologized her, she accepted the apologies.



Month and half later from this party (2 days ago) we accidentaly met at next party. At the very first moment she acted kind of strange, like she didn't want to meet me in first place, but shortly afterwards this passed. So we talked a lot. Like really a lot. At 2;00AM we even went on a walk - somebody needed to bypass our friend, I offered that I would do this, and asked for someone to help me, because this guy was blacking out. She did approach on me and offered that we would both go. It was like 20 minutes of pure conversation. She even has called me really intelligent, and she apologized for how she treated me after the first party. I didn't want to fuck up and kiss her or just move on. Why? She really hates men that she've firstkissed at the party.



Okay, so here I am now, with confused feelings. I would really like to date her. When I started writing to her, she was like absent.  One sentence short answers without any emotions. That's really strange considering she is rather talkative.

Her father passed away and her mother kicked her out and she was in a rough patch. We helped her out by putting her in a house rent free (long story) and paying for her phone. The deal was she had to find a job with decent pay and hours to move out of the house and into her own place. She never tried to go to businesses in person to give her résumé and insisted to do it all online. 


My parents and friends didn't like her mentality and I felt she needed time adjusting to life without her father. I've been trying to do the right thing and move on. Got rid of her stuff, spent time with friends, and focused on things that make me a better person physically and mentally. However I still keep thinking about her all the time even after two years. I met a lot of people who were either out of my age range or taken and online dating has been a disaster for me.

16572,Dating,2rdpj6,"I hate having to come here, but the people in my life that I would usually talk to are too close to her for my own comfort, so I'd rather ask you guys. 

I've known this girl since sophomore year of high school. She dated my best friend at the time and it lasted all of two weeks, that's how I met her. Anyway, somehow, about a year later, we got really close but I was after two different girls at the time so I never pursued her. When the other two failed, I started falling for her and she seemed to reciprocate. Both being young and dumb, I do not think either of us really know what to do, and the feelings turned into a fight and we didn't speak for a while. 

I really didn't talk to her much senior year of high school or freshman year of college (we go to the same place) outside of maybe a few interactions. We've both had our own romantic interests since our big meltdown, but towards the end of this past fall semester, her and I began talking a lot and hanging out quite often. Out of no where she became very touchy, very flirty, and was very obviously cuddling with me whenever I'd come over. She was also very flirty when we were texting/calling each other and acted on a different level than she ever did before. This took me off guard and it took me a few days to really decide how I felt about it.

Well, I fell, and I fell hard. The last time I was saw her was two days before Christmas. She got sick, had cousins come into town, and is at some religious convention out of state at the moment, so I have not seen her in person since then. 

Her texting has been erratic, sometimes she's great, other times she is kind of short. However, she has mentioned before how all of her friends think I'm going to date one of her sorority sisters, followed up by telling me she has no feelings for the guy they think she likes. Both were unprovoked and came out of the blue, so she was obviously thinking about it. Fast-foward to New Years Eve, she is with her cousins because they were leaving for the conference, and I went to that girl's apartment to celebrate with a bunch of her sorority sisters. She found this out and began blowing up my phone just to chat and asked me several times who was the lucky girl I kissed at midnight because she was simply curious. I didn't kiss any of them, but I just kind of jokingly played with her and said all of them, which obviously did not happen.

Anyway, she left for the trip and I woke up on New Years to 160 text messages. Many were just one word per message, but she was obviously very bothered by the fact that I was with them and had me on the mind. We texted a bit that day but once she got there it slowed down to a halt. 

On  Friday, she sent me a bunch of snapchats asking if I missed her, stuff like that. That was the only time we talked that day. On Saturday, I was slammed busy the entire day and we didn't talk at all. Then yesterday, Sunday, I sent her a snapchat and a text, neither of which she responded to. 

I've known her long enough and know her nearly better than anyone, so I do not think she is just playing me, but it is stressing me out because she has evoked the feelings and now that I'm emotionally invested I do not want to walk away with nothing when I know she has something. Her actions over the past month prove that whether she tries to deny it or not, she has something there for me. I'm just scared that I'm about to find myself facing a pain in the ass denial of feelings chat with her rather than a simple I like you when she gets back. I'm not scared of losing the friendship, I'm just scared of walking away with absolutely nothing and it is stressing me out badly. 

I like her a lot, and I want to be with her. Her recent actions are just simply giving me pause. I can't think of a reason she would ignore everything. Anyway, any advice or opinions? Sorry for this being so long. Thank you for reading.

101007,Relationships,2cvvil,"My wife can't stop 'chatting' online. She used to do it all the time before she met me. Stopped or kept it hidden during the first year or so of our dating. Then we moved to a big city and within a few months she met some guy online had sex with him, and was even considering leaving me for him. 

She chose to stay with me. We moved on got married a few years later. Not sure if she was 'chatting' the whole time or not. Recently she told me she did 'chat' once after we first got married, because she was bored. But stopped after a day. 

We have had a child since this, he is 3. We moved from a big city to be closer to family. Recently she was caught (or admitted, depends on who is telling the story) 'chatting' again. We had it out, I let her know that in my view this is not something a happy wife does. If she is unhappy then we/she needs to resolve that or split up.

I let her know how much it hurts me. She says it's not real. Then she goes and starts actually making friends with these 'fake' people. She has intimate(not just sexual) conversations with strangers. She says she has no interest in meeting other people, but that she does not think she can stop or does not want to stop. 

I have said we need to split up and that I do not want to support her while she does these things. She says it's no big deal and it's better than her fucking other people in real life.  

I did some research and some soul searching and I told her I am ok with it as long as it does not affect our relationship. Which when this all started was not doing well due to various stressful factors. We have both made efforts to connect with each other more, but I feel her efforts are just cover fire for her private behavior. 

She said she does not feel proud of her behavior, and that the chats are gross and it's a gross part of her that she wants to change/stop. But just not right now. 

Recently it felt as if she was trying to turn the corner, then I caught her chatting again. And it was a special day for us, so I emotionally retreated. She asked what was wrong, and I told her what I knew.  I told her I want a divorce, she said she won't sign one. That I gave her permission to do it and I need to make up my mind on whether I am ok with it or not. 

So I said I am not ok with it, and are you going to stop? Then she changed the subject.  

At this point I feel she is only married to me because of the security I provide. I am the sole income provider. We are doing big life things together (new home, she keeps waffling back and forth about wanting another baby) And the whole time now all I can think about is how she is chatting on her phone at every opportunity. 

She has said repeatedly that she does not know what it means 'to be in love'. But she loves me, but might not be in love with me. She says a divorce would be bad for our son, as if that is the only reason we are together in the first place.

Background time: I met my girlfriend Ashley about seven months ago, at the same time as I met all of my close friends. There are five of us: me, Ashley, her roommate Sarah [22 F], Michael [22 F], and Jessica [22 F]. We're a very close group of friends: Sarah is like a sister to me (more than my actual sister), Michael is like a brother to Ashley, and Ashley and Sarah might as well be sisters. Also, Michael and I both find Jessica attractive. In my case, I know Jessica and I have a lot in common—we're both from the same town/school, know a lot of the same people, enjoy similar music, have similar personalities—and I could definitely see being with her for a long time.

At the time, Ashley, Sarah, Michael, and I all thought that Jessica and Michael would get together soon—they'd been very close friends for ages and there was (we thought) some obvious chemistry between them. So, I ignored my feelings for Jessica because I didn't want to be that guy and butt in where I thought they had something good in the works.

Less than a week after I met her, I started to think that Ashley had a crush on me. She made it obvious at a movie night by getting touchy-feely, and eventually Ashley and I ended up getting a bit physical. Both of us immediately said we weren't interested in a long term relationship, for different reasons. She had just come out of a very bad relationship and didn't want to rush into a new one, while I knew that a relationship with her wasn't going to work in the very long term because of personality conflicts. We ended up seeing each other every day for the next two weeks, so we were together despite what both of us said.

Less than a month later, I find out that Jessica wasn't interested in Michael romantically. I kept dating Ashley because of a mix of not wanting to hurt her and not wanting to lose her companionship. Cut to today, seven months later. Michael and I are both leaving for jobs in other states, but I don't to go without having at least tried for a relationship with Jessica.

I want to break up with Ashley, but with less than a month until I leave (early August) I don't think there'll be a reasonable break between relationships. I can't just break up with her and immediately ask Jessica out—I'm pretty sure the whole friend group would shun me at that point, and I wouldn't blame them. The worst part is I'm having trouble showing affection for Ashley, and sometimes I just find her company abrasive. I'm at a loss as to what I should do. Keep on with my relationship until I leave town? Break up with her and then just try to be friends with everyone? Break up, wait a week or two, and ask Jessica out?

Edit: Thanks for the advice. I'm going to break up with Ashley and leave it at that.

It's crazy because this whole thing hasn't even lasted two weeks, but with the amount of contact that we had with each other, it seemed like much longer. I don't want to think I am overreacting, so I guess I am asking for your feedback and criticism if there is any. Here goes:


23/f, got matched on Hinge with 23/m. First date goes swimmingly, we met up at a bakery for coffee and spent the next three hours together - talking, walking, park-meandering. It seemed like he was really into me. He flat out asked if we could go off somewhere and make out. We have a lot in common - religion, places we are from and like, and he seemed like a really genuine and caring person. After that first date we began to text regularly, with both of us initiating contact equally, I would say. To boot, I know people he went to college with from high school, and he knows people I went to college with from high school...so there's that connection.


We both live with family members, so I was eager to invite him over to my place when I finally had it to myself for a couple days...I wasn't sure when the opportunity would come again. I did tell him that I hoped I wasn't being clingy, and he said not to worry. He slept over both nights, we didn't have sex (learned that lesson rather quickly with previous guys), but we talked till 3am, woke up to make out, cuddled, all that good stuff. Only on the second night did we do anything sexual, but still, no sex. I had been very open with how I felt my feelings were progressing with him, and I felt he was doing the same with me. I told him I wanted to take things slow and he agreed. The one weird thing I took note of was that he revealed to me that he asked one of his friends from college (from my high school) about me...apparently this girl only said good things, but that got me a little nervous about whether he asked our mutual acquaintances from college about me (in college, I was a little isolated and was in a weird relationship for some of it, and I wouldn't necessarily want that information coming to him third hand). I tried to blow off my weird feelings about this due to my anxiety.


After those two days of fun I had to go out of town for 4 days, which included a weekend. We texted throughout that time, and he even texted me on my last day to wish me luck on the things I had to do, which I did not expect, but was so nice to wake up to and felt very validating.


The day after I came back from my trip he started to become less chatty and responsive to texts. Soon I felt like I was the one initiating all the time, and although he would respond positively, it wouldn't necessarily start a conversation. Times where I insinuated we get together were ignored. Finally when I asked him today if we could get together, he says that he just wants to be friends. This comes totally out of nowhere.


Can you guys see anything from this that I did wrong?? I am really hoping that he didn't hear some weird shit from people I went to college or high school with, because it sort of bothers me that he contacted them in the first place. Also I wasn't that weird!!! I should probably just roll with the punches and move on, but this rejection came more out of left field than others. Is it possible that he made all that emotional effort for a bj???? I just feel very despondent and am hoping you all can provide me with some insight.

I was feeling a bit ... worked up... and tested the waters and got what I percieved as the cold shoulder. 20 minutes later after I thought she was asleep (not being sneeky, just common courtesy not to make it obvious I guess) I snuck off into the bathroom to have some ""ME"" time. 10 minutes go by and I am in the middle of ""culmination"" and she comes beating the door down. And tells me to stop and she can help and all that.  I didn't tell her what ""stage"" I was in I just cleaned up my mess and opened the door. She was pretty upset. She got in the shower and we were talking about it and I apologized and explained that I must have missread the situation and I would have wrather had her any day of the week, I just didn't think that was on the table.

She is a 21 year beautiful girl who goes to the same college, with a great personality. She did not get accepted into a dorm room, nor find a place to live, so i let her crash at my apartment. 


This of course lead to fights, and more importantly, a week of trial dating. She wasn't sad, nor overjoyed about it. I, of course, loved it. Nothing really changed in our routines except i no longer felt the need to be insecure about her just being friends with me to live with me; or her seeing other guys, etc. All the worries just disappeared because i naturally put faith in relationships.


She doesn't want to date because her first major relationship was abusive, and her second major relationship was with a drug addict, and they distracted her from school and life. She has fears of this happening again.


Now I'm overwhelmed by all the insecurities now that she and i are no longer ""together"". And i don't think we will ever get date.

147206,Non-Romantic,1shjy5,"Basically, I generally have a lot of problems with my mom. To start, my mom is not a bad person, and was generally a good mom, if somewhat-helicoptery. But growing up, I felt like she would often use me as a prop for her own attention. She was always pushing me to perform in church/theater/what have you, even if I expressed how much I didn't want to. She has apparently admitted to my brother that sometimes she does this. She would also do things like, if an adult asked me a question, she would jump in and answer it for me. Or, if I was telling a story to someone else, she would interrupt mine to tell her own story. She still even does this now, without another person. She will ask me a question, and while I'm in the middle of answering, jump in to talk about some TV show she watches.

She has no real friends, barely any hobbies. But she is super into Christmas, and holidays and decorating and all of that. I live at least 2 1/2 hours away; my siblings live even further (partially to get away from my parents). Every year, she hounds me and my siblings about what we want for Christmas, and to write a Christmas blurb for a Christmas letter she sends out every year. My brothers and I are not religious (which she is NOT happy about), don't really like to decorate, and I hate writing this stupid blurb every year. My brother likes to do ridiculous things on this blurb because if we have to do it, may as well make it interesting? So this year, he wrote a silly poem that took up like 3 extra pages or something. My mom was complaining to me about that, saying that while she thinks it's cute or whatever, she ran out of ink and had to go get another one. And I was essentially like, well, you know we don't really like doing it anyway... I suggested that maybe she could just send a regular photo card, or just do whatever her and my father have to update. She ended up saying, ""I don't know what I did you make you guys hate Christmas so much..."" So thinking of all her over-the-top decorating, hounding us about Christmas shit, I say, ""I think you know exactly what you did."" Honestly, I meant it more lighthearted than it came out, but looking back, I actually am pissed. Saying something like that seems very manipulative, trying to guilt me for not liking to do that stuff--like her wanting to play the martyr, which she is occasionally likely to do. What am I supposed to say to something like that?

I DO feel bad about what I said however, especially given her reaction. She blows up at me, starts crying, and refuses to answer her cellphone, makes my dad answer her cellphone. He has now enlisted my siblings' help in trying to calm her down, but I'm at a loss for what to say. I feel bad for upsetting her, but I am still really angry that she won't accept how I feel about this, and tries to make me feel bad about it. I go to all the holiday shit, I write the stupid blurbs for her, and now she expects me to love doing it?

I don't know what to say or what to do. I was going to try and apologize and calm her down, but she refused to talk to me earlier. I know it's about her feeling appreciated for all she does, but I don't even want her to do it, and more importantly, feel like she even listens to me at all. It's hard to feel appreciative of that. I'm trying to find it within me to apologize, but I feel really resentful right now.

42850,Relationships,1q6eff,"So, I have been with this guy for 10 months.  I generally enjoy my time with him, especially when we're intimate, but I find myself getting more and more bothered by some of the comments that he makes towards others.  He has a habit of saying things that make him seem aloof or unempathetic (he himself said to me months ago that he really doesn't have empathy for people, but that I'm an exception).  Truth be told, I don't think that he has ever said anything unempathetic to my problems, but he has on occasion said things regarding others, and to others, that make him seem somewhat aloof.  Whenever they happen, they stick with me.  Here are some:

On one of our first dates, we sat down to eat in a restaurant, and he immediately was rude to the waitress.  I don't remember exactly what he said, but I remember being mortified and looking away.  I think he was trying to be funny, but it didn't work.

More recently, when we were in the parking lot of a store, loading the car, a couple high school-aged girls came up to us and asked us to donate to a summer camp that they were a part of.  They had a binder and some trinkets that they were offering; it at least seemed legit.  Anyway, we said that we didn't have any money, but then my boyfriend threw in that he helps the world with science (he's a chemistry Ph.D. student, I'm a chemical engineering Ph.D. student).  I told him after that that he sounded aloof, and he agreed.

Yesterday, then, he told me that he was going to start meeting with a student from his class on a regular basis.  He has said that he refuses to meet with students outside of regular office hours, but that this girl had issues that made her an exception.  The student apparently is not good in science but made the switch because she was inspired by a family member.  Anyway, at some point, he referred to the student as an idiot, which he later rephrased to ignorant (of the subject matter of the class).  I talked to him about that too, and he said that he is not in graduate school to teach...which I suppose is true, but the word idiot stuck with me.

There have been other instances.

Anyway, when we are romantic, things are good, but when I am not with him, I don't generally miss him a whole heck of a lot, and when I am with him in a non-romantic context, he often bugs me by talking about his chemistry at a high level of detail, to the point of drawing figures on restaurant placemats.  I wonder if the things that he says are causing this.  He has been good to me and helped me through my problems, but...I don't know.  I don't feel like I love him as much as I should, and I don't know if I can see myself staying with him forever.  It's weird because it goes from one extreme to the other, but maybe I enjoy being with him sexually because I would enjoy being with a lot of people sexually, regardless of their personalities.

This was a rambling post, but my question is this: how do you think it might be best for me to try to forget the things that he says?  Should I call him on his aloofness every time it comes up?  I know that you can't really change a person, but...if you were in my situation, and you were bothered by some of his remarks, what would you do?

60859,Relationships,25iwjb,"Hi everyone,  
I have a problem, my Wife and I had lots of issues these past years (I have used this sub a few times to get help) and we managed to pull through for the most part.  
Now the question of having kids seems to be more present in her mind so we've discussed it. A few months ago I've been told that I have a degenerative disease (not life threatening but it will definitively generate issues in the next years of my life, please I don't want to go into details on this so don't ask). It made me realize that having kids might not be something that I'm capable of and I want to take time to see things coming.  
My wife previously told me that she did not want kids. Now she's saying she wants one. I understand this, we've discussed it a lot and I've told her that for now I need to focus on facing my problem and that I can't handle more stress. I'm definitely not ready for that and I don't know if I'll ever be.  
While she's being very supportive and understanding I feel that she's not happy with this decision.  
I don't know what to do. She also want to move from our house to get a bigger place and at the same time complains about money even if we're comfortable with what we both earn. She works A LOT (studies all day and work at night). She's tough I'll give her that but she can be distant and cold sometimes. She's also very tired these days.  
I don't really want to move from where we live and I've been dragging my feet on this for a while. I like our place, our neighborhood. Well our life as it is.  
We've also discussed this and she feels that we're not moving forward. It's something that I don't feel. I'm afraid that this means that I'm taking things for granted.  
  
I've been getting help on my side but it's hard to manage everything.  
  
I feel like I'm being unreasonable but I don't want to force myself to do something that I don't want to.  
  
I don't know what to do. Counseling is not an option, I suggested it to her and she always reply that we just cannot afford it as it is quite expensive and that she does not have time for it, which is true. We already have a busy schedule and have little time together.  
  
I bluntly told her that I would not consider having a child until I'm sure that she has worked through her problems (eating disorder, stress, and everything that goes with it) and she's working on it. Which is great, she's making progress.  
  
I feel like I'm denying her something that she has every right to want.  
My life is fucked right now, I'm getting there but it might take a while. I want to be strong and supportive and I feel week right now. I hate that. I need time to myself and I'm afraid that it'll cause resentment, pain, sadness, you name it, in the long run.

I eat with my male coworker from Monday through Friday and often, our female coworker, whom I will call Beatriz, eats with us. Beatriz lives a few minutes walking distance from our house, so we often drop her off at home after work since she doesn't have a car. I also see her often in social events, either in our bosses' house or in parties hosted by common friends of ours that work in the same building as us.

About five months ago, Beatriz's boyfriend of almost 10 years broke up with her to be with another woman. He had been cheating on her for a few years. Beatriz was devastated. She is from a different country and came to live here because of her ex. Because of this, I started to invite her fairly often to my house. We both like cooking and baking, and DIY activities. During this time I also invited her to join me and my husband on our movie nights, shared taxis with her when we went out socially with common friends, etc. 

A couple of weeks ago I invited her to help  paint our apartment. For several hours, it was only me and Beatriz because my husband was working and our roommate was out of town. I regretted inviting her right away because she started being very bossy, telling me which colors I should use, which walls I should paint first, and so on. When my husband arrived I wanted some time for myself, so I went to the store to buy more paint and other materials. 

The kissing attempt. My husband told me that, while I was away, he thinks she tried to kiss him. He explained that she put her face really close to his, so close that it was almost kissing distance. He felt super nervous and turned his head sideways and started talking about the wall. Then he backed away and went to another room. I know that my husband does not like her at all. He is not attracted to her physically, and he is not a big fan of her personality. He puts up with her a lot because she is the only other woman at my job. I even stopped inviting her to the movies with us because my husband told me that he was happier going only with me, like a date.

I have not seen her since this happened because she went back to her country during the summer to visit her family. However, she will come back in a week or two. I don't know if I should ignore this or talk to her about this. I was hoping to get outside perspective and feedback on how to handle this. Please note that I do believe she intended to kiss my husband. Woman intuition.

30237,Relationships,2zt2lg,"Hello all. I need some advice. I have been living together with this man for 9 months, dating for 1 year 5 months.

During that time, we have got along very well with the exception of how conflicts are resolved. When I would like to bring something up to my bf that is bothering me (anything from me feeling sad, to asking him to help with more housework, to discussing how he hurt my feelings with a poor choice of wording) it typically blows up into a way bigger than it needs to be thing. To preface, I always try to bring up issues in a happy, neutral, non-confrontational tone.

Example: Hey, I know you've been working really hard and stressed with your busy hours, but I've been feeling really down and lonely lately, can you help cheer me up?

example: Can we take some time to talk about the fight we had last night? I'd like it if we can discuss how we can talk better in the future.

For instance, asking him to do something as trivial as picking up more of the house duties so that we are split more evenly in house cleaning. Currently, I do much more housework. We both work full time though he is an accountant so he's in his busy season so he works 60hr weeks from Jan-April. As as a result, I do 80% of cleaning during this period. I've asked him to handle bathroom weekly cleaning where, before, he was content cleaning less frequent as he is fine with a less-tidy house than I am. Messes make me uncomfortable. Bringing this up to him (my cleaning preference) made him clam up and get SUPER defensive making him say I was calling him a slob, saying that I said he never cleaned and him saying, Don't you understand I'm under a lot of stress and I just want to relax when I come home?. The resultant fight went on for a day. A lot of yelling. He said he was infuriated i insinuated that if I left dirty dishes in the sink he would probably not wash them for a week (though this is probably true). I didn't say it snidely, I just was using it as a point of cleanly reference and he got SUPER PISSED. I was so shocked the convo didn't go something like, Hey I was wondering if you could help me clean up around the house a bit more? I feel like I'm doing a disproportionate amount of the chores lately and I'm feeling bogged down. Him: Oh, I didn't know you felt that way. What should we split? The end. The fight escalated around arguing semantics of he said she said rather than figuring out a cleaning schedule that worked for both of us.

Another more serious emotional support point is if I tell him something I need support with, for example, feeling sad, he never offers emotional support. For example, if I tell him Hey hon, I'm feeling down lately. Work's been hard and I've had a hard time with my family. I feel as though I would expect some sort of pep talk or something from him. I usually get nothing but a quick hug and a kiss on the head. I ask him to say something, maybe give me some words of encouragement and he just asks, What do you want me to say? I tell him, Anything, just something to cheer me up? Words of encouragement? Nothing. He just stares at me and gets pissed that it's not enough. Sometimes that starts a big fight if I don't accept it. 


The other kind of thing that leads frequently to arguments is anything that hurts my feelings taken accidentally out of context. For example, bf says something that I misinterpret as a jerk comment. It hurts my feelings so I let him know his comment hurt my feelings hoping he will say sorry and explain the truth behind his comment to make me feel better. I ASSUME he doesn't mean a jerk comment because I don't think he'd ever say anything asshole on purpose. The exchange typical goes as follows: 

me: (looking sad) [Bf], I want you to know the thing you said earlier really hurt my feelings. 

Him: I'm sorry, but YOU took it WRONG. What actually happened was ______!

I feel like a typical thing to say would be I'm sorry I hurt your feelings. I didn't realize it made you feel that way. I intended this  ____.

He immediately makes me feel like a dummy for not understanding the true intent of whatever the situation is and his sorry is ALWAYS followed by a BUT YOU TOOK IT WRONG. It flusters me so badly because I'm emotionally hurt at that point and hearing it is shitty because I'm hoping for empathy for a moment and then a logical explanation.

My girlfriend of a year and eight months and I have been broken up for about a week already and I'm needing to vent and get some pointers as how to deal with it better. This is my first break up, but she on the other hand has dealt with break ups before. I think i'm taking it kinda hard is because it is my first and I feel like I wont feel the same with anyone else. Some backstory as to our history as a couple, we shared a lot of first experiences together some small such as both of us going on an “official” date and some big as being each others first sexual experience. Though she had had two other relationships where she had fallen in love with her boyfriend she had never been able to go out on an official date that was just the two of them, a parent or sibling always accompanied them. So when I came into the picture I thought of it only natural to go out alone for a date and not have to be looked after by someone. 

I found it so odd that I was her first date I was only doing what I had seen in movies. ( That sounds lame to me lol, but it worked all my knowledge of going out on dates and preparing romantic stuff was from watching movies) Eventually we got to a point where we became intimate and we lost our virginities to each other, this was a huge step for the both of us and we saw that it would only bring us closer. (It did.) We got caught up in high school love, we both thought we would last forever, but sadly things just didn't turn out that way. Im going to be going into what led up to the break up and what we both felt at the end of it.

So for some time starting in the summer I had begun to feel a sense of boredom with her and apart of me wanted to have the opportunity to date more and just be able to have the experience with different people. This was causing me to see flaws in her that began to annoy me at some points. The biggest problem that I had seen is our trouble communicating with each other. Like I always had to start the conversation or else we would sit in silence on the phone, I had to always find things to talk about, and I would have to do my best to keep the conversation going. This was definitely a reason as for me getting bored and is the biggest reason for us breaking up. 

During the summer I had a packed schedule I was taking college course to get ahead so my time was consumed. She however had a free summer seeing as she had also taken college courses before and had nothing more to gain from the local community college that allowed us to take such courses. I'm getting ahead of myself, let me point out she is a year older than me and so she was getting ready to go off to a college four hours away and I was getting ready to enter my last year of high school. So with me still having to take college classes for my high school I didn't have a lot of time to see her and when I was given the free time I didn't have the energy nor desire to go see her. I personally think that missing out on time we could have spent together hurt our relationship a lot over the summer. 

Before she had left to college we had a discussion addressing these two factors and how we felt about them. I was the one who was explaining myself the most here while she mainly listened. We almost broke it off right there but we picked up the pieces and had determination that things would work out between us if we worked at it. Well when she left I saw an immediate drop in communication between us. She had very tough classes to deal with now and a rough schedule. So now even talking on the phone was limited to about ten minutes before she just fell asleep out of exhaustion, I knew she had a lot on her plate but me being stupid kept getting upset at the fact she didn't talk to me. I began to start pestering her about our communication becoming less but I’d mention it in a joking manner however there was truth within these jokes and she saw it. One day after me teasing her about neglecting me she just flat out said that she didn't think she couldn't handle the relationship anymore that it would just be best if we split up. We had a short talk at that moment via phone call and well we both briefly explained that maybe it easy for the best, however I did want to get into the whole situation much deeper but I was not in a place to talk at the time and my phone had also died on me. So when I got home and called her back she had already removed all statues saying we were together and changed my contact within her phone. I was saddened by this but didn't push on the topic and we said our goodbyes. The first day was rough and I wanted to text her throughout the day and I gave in later in the day. We talked about why this happened and who wanted it more, she admitted that she did and that she felt bad that she couldn't give me the attention that a couple was suppose to have. She said she felt like we were just friends by that point and she was right, a part of me felt like we were just friends. 

We said talked it out and well we both said that we still wanted to remain close friends but that it would only be achieved once we were both over each other, I had mentioned that I will always see her in my circle of close friends even if I dont share an intimate life with her. She agreed with me on that, but didn't really elaborate on it, she just replied with a “yeah I feel the same” After the talk I felt soooo much better, I had my questions answered and really said what I needed to say. I assume she feels the same way too. But from time to time I still think about her and I miss what we had and not what the relationship was at its final moment. I dont know what it is I actually want now, I have the opportunity to have more experiences now that I am single but I also just want to be back with her, it feels like I wont be able to make the same connection with another. She was my bestfriend and my first girl friend. I just dont know how to deal with what i'm feeling. Do I really want to get back with her or is that just the heartbreak talking or do I really want to meet others and move on. Idk. 

Sorry if this doesn't flow good, I just needed to let it all out. I’d appreciate any comments that ya’ll leave. Advice on how to get past it or help me figure out whether what i'm feeling now or what I was feeling while with her was the right feeling.

117189,Breakups,27wwjl,"Hello all.  


I've been reading this subreddit for a while now, but this is my first post here and I hope you can help me with my issue. 


**First a little background:**  


I'm a really shy person, though that has been slowly improving over the years. I've had many problems in all my time in school with being made fun of constantly, which changed me in many ways. It also made me not like people for the most part. I've also always been a pretty cheerful person on the outside, while suffering on the inside.  


I've met the girl in question at a huge bonfire yearly party thingy a bit longer than 2 years ago. I was there with a good friend of mine and our groups met each other there, because my friend and a girl she was with were childhood friends.  
How we actually started talking, with me being my shy self, was a pretty funny/awkward situation. But it's not important. What is important though is that we hit it of really well. We started just chatting and we met every day for the next week and started dating right after. I was the happiest I have ever been in my life. She was my first and to date the only girl I have ever loved or been with, she was sweet and kind and beautiful. But I was young, foolish, stupid and too proud and stubborn... We were together for only 2 months and a half (so short it almost seemes trivial, but i really fell for her), mostly because of me being a stupid fool and overthinking everything and being too paranoid about everything... It ended with a shouting match while we were on vacation and me saying something very very horrible to her in the heat of the moment.  

It took me a while, but after spending the remainder of the summer feeling sorry for myself and thinking about stuff, I realized what I had done wrong, how foolish I was. I figured she hated me because of what I said to her in that last fight and she had found a new boyfriend by mid september so I didn't contact her. I managed to forget her for a good few months, until my conscience started beeping at me making me feel bad for how it all ended. So i sent her a text around mid january apologizing for what I had done back then. At first she didn't want to talk to me, but then she accepted my apology and I felt quite a weight lift from my shoulders. I figured that was it. We were now truly done. But we weren't.  


About a month later, I saw her again. She came to a handball match with her boyfriend and all the old emotions came flooding back. I spent most of the game looking over in her direction instead of watching the game being played. We even talked briefly in the half time. But yea. It hit me hard and everything came back. She seemed happy. But I got a text from her about 2 weeks later and long story short, they've had problems for a while and it ended with him leaving her the day before her prom.  


I feel like I ram rambling a bit too much so I'll shorten the last bit. Basically what happened was that we started talking and chatting quite a bit again. And we became really good friends over the course of the next year. Though after about 2 months she had met a guy and fell madly in love with him. So we chatted less and didn't really see each other during this one year. I was there for her any time she needed someone to talk to and she was there for me. But I lost any romantic interest once again.  


She broke up with the guy in march this year. And ever since then we have been hanging out a lot. My feelings for her came back. She knows how I feel towards her. But she says, she just can't feel the same for me as I feel for her. We've been pretty much each others best friends for the past few months. I don't have really any true friends besides her at this point. She's the only one I can talk to about anything and vice versa. We give each other advice all the time.  



My problem right now is quite a dilemma for me. On one hand I wish to forget my feelings for her so I can move on in this way, but on the other hand I want us to stay just as good friends as we have been. What I fear is that I can't have both. That in order to forget about my feelings for her, I will have to cut ties with her. Stop talking to her and meeting up with her...  


I don't know what to do. So I came here to look for advice. Is there any way I can stay really good friends with her and forget about my feelings or am I a doomed man?

She would work my wife for every penny she was paying her. After a while, she would send her home and only have her come at peak hours. On top of that, she was only paying her 8 dollars an hour, which is one under minimum wage in our state. I felt so betrayed because I had considered her as a second mom growing up.

They did this randomly and without even warning him, probably because they knew he'd be upset. Also anytime he shows interest in a girl she'll say she's too short or some shit (he's 6'6). So..

To give some background, I've just started into a new relationship after a long (read: 4+ years) dry spell.

She's mentioned that as a child (I don't really know what age, she said 2 one time and 4 another), she would come home from work and there would be a tiny hole in my pants in the crotch area. She said she'd also find them in my underwear sometimes and swears that they were not there before she left the house. She also told me she questioned my Dad about this and he would become angry and ask him what she was accusing him of. Until I was about 13 she would check my vagina yearly (I think she said it was to find infections, but I think she was actually looking to see if my hymen was intact???)

My Dad and I have always had a pretty good relationship. Maybe 3 fights in all these years. I am finding it really difficult to even THINK of the idea of him doing something like that. 

My parents divorced when I was 4. They both moved to the same town so I still saw my dad 3 days a week. My parents never had a good relationship. I don't get along with my mother very well. She's very paranoid and judgmental. She claims he was extremely controlling and abusive, he claimed that he wasn't and that she would stalk him at work (he said she would write down his miles on his speedometer and question him if they were over a certain amount). 

I do know that my mother is VERY paranoid. She is always looking for some sort of drama, and believes everyone is out to get her. She is constantly looking for some mystery to solve, so my gut tells me that my absent-minded mother SAW these holes after the fact and believed in her mind that she checked beforehand, when she probably didn't look and that the holes were from a washing machine, or some other reason. I don't really know. 

I really don't see why ANYONE who would molest a child would cut their pants/underwear, because that would be incredibly obvious and doesn't make too sense. But maybe there is no logic involved.  

But I guess to play devil's advocate, I don't have much (or really any) memory of my childhood, besides bits and pieces. I know this is a tell tale giveaway of some trauma, so I'm not sure if it's from the divorce or maybe I just have a bad memory. Or maybe something else happened. I am very sensitive when my boyfriend or past boyfriend's finger me. But I think this is due to the fact that I've been masturbating with a vibrator for a while, and it's become a bit sensitive to touch. I'm not sure.

Don't know if my ex will find this sock as my title is very descriptive. I don't care. 

My ex and I dated for 6 years, until August. The first 4 were amazing. The next 2 were rough as hell. The first 6 months was caused by me. 

I suffered a very traumatic life event that disrupted my whole family. I was whiny, clingy and I used to question my boyfriend's love for me at every turn. I'd always say you can't love me, no one can love me. We had a mutual very close friend, L. She was closer to him than me, and up until now I didn't care. In these six months I started to get jealous and question if he liked her more than me. He hated this. After 6 months he snapped at me and told him this was killing him, that I had to stop. 

So I did. I learned to be my old happy, confident self again. And I returned to that state of being. 

A month after my re-transformation, my ex/boyfriend at the time found out that he hadn't gotten the dream job he'd been hoping for, and officially entered into bleak unemployment. He got a great job in March, but his depression and massive anxiety issues remained. 

He plummeted into a deep clinical depression that he was in denial about. He became withdrawn and would get very angry and abusive towards me. We separated for a day within the middle. He came and begged to take me back. When he took me back, I told him that he'd been spending more time and energy on our friends, especially L. He agreed. He told me that he felt closer to some of our friends (including L) than me at times. But he realized that was just him sabotaging our relationship, and that actually, it was me he loved and wanted. He was lovely for a month. Then it went back to being emotionally abusive and rough.

Why did I stay? Because I'm actually a very strong person and he was the person that I loved, plain and simple. I am more the guy in the relationship. I'm more laid-back, relaxed and I even earn the most money. I love buying him things (which he isn't super fond of). I tried to discuss our future with him: about moving in together. He wasn't that interested in that. He found it awkward, and avoided the conversation. If he had asked me to marry him I would have (foolishly) said yes... 

In July-August 2013 he changed drastically. He suddenly became really nice and sweet. He told me that he realized he had been treating me terribly, and he wanted to learn to treat me as nicely as I treat him. I really believed there was hope for our relationship.

Until one fateful day in August he breaks up with me. No real explanation. His explanation was that he was in love with me but didn't know how to express it like you can and thought I deserved better. He had realized how terribly he was acting and tried to make it better, but couldn't do it any more. So we slip.

I went NC because fuck it, I just didn't want to contact him. I didn't have a desire to text or any shit like that. 

The next day he came back and begged me to take me back. I said no. We had a period of 1 month where we danced around one another, with me reiterating that we couldn't get back together. He floated the idea of friends with benefits where we basically dated again and expressed our love, but with no future obligations. This crushed me, and I said no. One month in I said I wanted to get back together. He said it wasn't a good idea. I asked if he was holding a torch for me. He said no. He was clearly lying though, that much is confirmed. 

Two months into our break-up in late October, he comes and declares his love again and asks me to take him back. I say no, but we end up having ex sex. 

This was followed by 4 months of us increasingly spending more time as friends where we would spend days/nights together in bliss. We even developed a Saturday night pattern: 

* We'd meet for dinner. We'd have dinner. 
* We'd go pick up a bottle of wine.
* We'd go back to my place, and we'd watch DOTA games.
* We'd then look fondly into each others eyes, and he'd come in and kiss me. We'd then end up kissing/cuddling. He'd let it slip out that he loved me, and then I'd stiffen up. He'd apologise. We'd then kiss/cuddle some more. I'd say to him I can't get back together how can we get over this. He said that if I felt that way he understood, but he wanted to spend as much time with me as he could anyway. 
* We'd drink wine, watch DOTA, and have sex for hours and hours. He'd continuously declare his love for me, followed by apologies for letting it slip, and then sometimes I'd let it slip too. 
* We'd go on a fast food run, and then fall asleep in each others arms at 5am. 

I'd then wake up and enforce us to pretend as though it never happened. He'd ask when he could see me next, and lock in a time. He'd then message me, and he'd eagerly talk to me in-between. 

You can imagine this got a little ridiculous. I was still madly in-love with him. Our friends noticed our bouncing chemistry and started asking us why we weren't together. One Saturday I was just overwhelmed with feelings for him, and I professed my love to him too whenever he did to me. He suggested that we go on a weekend trip away together. So we did... and we had an amazing time. We talked the whole time, including the 8-hour drive each way, which he drove because he knows I don't feel comfortable driving.

On our way back, we discussed our status. I said I considered him my boyfriend. He said he considered me his girlfriend, and that he felt really lucky and that he was so happy that he'd been given a second chance. 

Things went well. We slowly entered back into a new relationship. It was bliss on a new level we'd never experienced. We would have amazing sex, amazing conversations, and we were more open about everything than we'd ever been, leading to a great intimacy. Everyone around us noticed our bouncing chemistry. We have been planning our future together and discussing concrete details for that. He introduced me to his workmates at a function as his partner. I love his family and that they were like a surrogate one to me. He had been encouraging me to see them, and organized an afternoon tea for us, which was amazing. Everything was amazing. 

Well... except for one gigantic detail he failed to disclose to me. 

One of our friends, N, found out a few days ago about me and my ex. He told her when they ate dinner while catching up. She got furious and told him she never wanted to be his friend again. He came back after their friend date, utterly distraught, and very confused. 

I caught up with her today. I asked N what had caused her to be so unhappy. She said that she couldn't believe that I would want to date him after everything. Like what, I said? I wanted to know which specific thing. That is when she said: because he had feelings for L during your relationship. 

*What*?

I rang up L. She didn't want to talk about it. What I got was the following: my ex had told her mid October that he had feelings for her, and had had them during the relationship. L and my ex had had a huge falling out - I was a little confused as to what could have lead to such bitterness - and this was apparently part of it. They had a fight, and then she decided that she shouldn't hang out with him because she didn't have feelings for him and didn't want to make it worse.

Furious, I rang up my ex. We met to talk. I screamed at him. When I calmed down I got the full story out of him.

* His feelings for L had come about during the period where I kept asking him over and over if he liked L more than me. He said that he started to wonder if I was right.
* My ex is a late bloomer sexually. He was starting to get a bigger sex drive, and had begun fantasizing about L sexually. He got scared that this meant he had feelings for her.
* He didn't actually think he did have feelings for her though, until early/mid 2012. That is actually when he entered his clinical depression, though he hasn't actually made that connection, I just noticed it when I worked out the timeline. 
* He said that he was in-love with me throughout it. But that he had feelings for L. He said that they were mostly sexual. He did fantasize a bit about them cuddling, but never about being in a relationship, and never about being together for the future. However, when our fights got bad (mostly caused by him), his feelings for L would grow and increase. During our bad days, he wondered if he loved L or not, which made him even more depressed and he hated himself.
* He confided late 2012 with our friend N. He said that he was scared that he was in love with L. He asked if he was supposed to break up with me, and to pursue L: because he didn't want to, but felt like it wasn't OK to be with me. She counselled him that it was just a crush, it would pass, and to stay with me. This is confirmed.
* August 2013 he seeked counsel with another friend. He told his friend that he was in-love with me but struggling to express affection to me, was depressed and also had feelings for L and was therefore not worthy of me. He said that he thought he should break-up with me until his feelings passed and he had gotten control of his mental illness. His friend agreed that it was the only way to preserve a future between us. That is confirmed. That night, my ex broke up with me. 
* In Mid October 2013 L confronted my ex and asked him if he had feelings for her. He cried and said he knew it'd ruin their friendship, but he did, but that he didn't want a relationship (neither did she - she had no feelings for him). He said he doesn't remember if he said he loved her or not. They agreed to not hang out 1-on-1 anymore. I don't know about that part, but the rest is confirmed.   
* My ex then claims that after admitting it, the feelings passed a few days later, and they have not been back ever since. He hasn't spent 1-on-1 time with her since that day. 
* He also says that upon reflection he realized that he actually made a big mistake. He didn't have feelings for L, besides sexual ones. Thinking about her as an alternative was an unhealthy way of dealing with his confusion over our flailing relationship, which was flailing due to his depression. Once we broke up, he still had no desire to be with her, he just *felt* things. 

Here is the thing. **No one bothered to tell me about this.**

My ex claims he meant to, but things spiraled and it became harder and harder. He kept meaning to, and looking back I can see there were situations where he was obviously trying to tell me, but cowardly stopped and turned the conversation into something else.

My friends L and N chose to not tell me to protect me. Which backfired, because I started secretly seeing my ex again...

When I confronted my ex with this, he broke down and sobbed and told me everything. We talked for 6 hours. I was an emotional roller coaster. He said he feels like he cheated on me. I said it felt like that too. He sobbed and told me he'd do anything to make it up to me, and that while he'll respect my decision if I cut him out of my life forever. I told him that if we were to stay together, he could never be friends with L ever again. He said that he'd do that in a heart beat. He said the guilt had been overwhelming him and he felt like the worst person in the world for the period that he had feelings for L.

He didn't cheat though: he specifically didn't act on his feelings. But they were there. And IMHO, one which he agrees with, he should have cut L out of his life once his feelings developed beyond a little crush. But he didn't, because he didn't want to admit to me what was going on. 

I'm a wreck. Is there any hope for us? You will all just say move the fuck on but he is very unique and special and I can find another guy, but I won't find my incredibly talented (by talented, I mean extraordinarily talented) childhood sweet heart who I want to fuck all of the goddamn time. Hell I'm demi-sexual and literally can't imagine having enjoyable sex with anyone else.

Is what he did unforgivable? He is clearly serious about our future NOW but whenever I remember the past the pain hits me so bad, I feel like I'm processing break up 2.0. Except this time I really want to find a way to work through this, because I truly believed we were ready to work towards a happy future.

Summary: I was seeing a girl for about 7 months until the end of December when she got angry at me for telling her friend we were sleeping together after he asked me. 

She stopped wanting to see me saying that we should have talked about it first before telling anyone. I've had a couple of text chats with her since, and spoke to her on the phone last week. She's still angry at me and doesn't want to see me. She said she'll call me this week but she still hasn't.

I believe she didn't treat me fairly and she's angry because I made her look bad since she was leading her friend and I along (that wasn't my intention I was just being honest to her friend because he asked me). Also this friend of hers is chasing her and paying for her/buying her things and she's keeping him around for convenience. It's all very immature and convoluted.

But I still have strong feelings for her and I'm trying to stop myself from contacting her again until she gets back to me if she ever does. I don't know what to do, it's really keeping my mind consumed and I guess part of reason I'm writing this is to let out these emotions without running to my phone. I need some sense knocked into me.

88170,Breakups,1s23f4,"This is going to be rambly so I apologize in advance. Two weeks ago I broke up with my boyfriend of 11 months after several months of staleness. We didn't have a whirlwind romance or anything. In retrospect, we were much better at being friends than romantic partners. We discussed that several times, but I always figured it would grow in time. I was open to growing to love him, and a couple of months ago when I was feeling particularly close to him I said the three words. He didn't say it back. I tried to play it off cool and said that I didn't expect to hear it back right away, but it left a bruise on my heart. I suppose I was testing the waters to see how he felt towards me. He didn't have to say it then, but I made a mental note to myself wondering how long I could wait until he said it back. If that date was reached and he didn't say it... what happened then? I was apprehensive for the future. Honestly, I never felt he was that ""into"" me. He never told me I was pretty, made me feel sexy or desirable, he never did or said anything to make me feel special. During many of our ""non-fight"" fights I told him this was an issue for me, and he would tell me he didn't know if he was able to give me what I wanted. But I went with the flow because when I wasn't worrying about the bigger picture, he was really easy to be with. I enjoyed his company because he was sweet, funny, good-head-on-his-shoulders, grounded, cute, got along well with my friends, tons of common interests, etc.

Yet things were not improving. We kept having the same ""non-fight"" fights with the same issues cropping up every time. I was having an increasingly difficult time compartmentalizing the stress and anxiety I had from my studies in grad school (architecture... oi!). I was having a harder and harder time putting on a nice face. I stopped wanting to hang out with his friends because my on-again off-again social anxiety crept back into the picture... in truth, I never did care for his friends that much anyway. He is a very patient and independent person and I never heard a complaint from him about my busy schedule. I started to feel slightly crazy for being the busy one but wanting to spend more time together. I was willing to sacrifice my time to hang out with him so why wasn't he trying harder for me? I became withdrawn and that was the beginning of the end.

The day we broke up started off on a very different note than the one it ended on. We were lying in bed in the morning and his parents called to say they were on their way to his house to drop off his car. We had a nice quickie before they showed up. I met them and they were lovely, sweet people. Spending time with them made me feel like I had got a big window into who he was and where he came from. I felt closeness when I usually felt like he was holding me at an arms length away. We wound up having a lovely afternoon and after they left he made pancakes and things felt good. 

We sat on the couch and were thinking of watching a movie when suddenly I thought of all the school work I needed to do. I thought of how disappointed I had been that he didn't ask me to spend Thanksgiving with his family. That meeting his parents was more coincidental than intentional. How unhappy the relationship was really making me feel. The stress pulled right back into my withdrawn state. He asked what was wrong, one thing led to another and I said, ""Do you think we should break up?"" Cue crying and sad stuff. He said he didn't want to break up, but knew that things weren't going to get better. I started throwing out ideas of how we could improve the problems between us, but he shot them down. I was hurt that he didn't want to try to make things work and I left his house pretty shortly after that. We were done. It felt so awful... like I had the carpet yanked out from underneath me.

Two days later I regretted calling things off. I deluded myself into thinking that he might feel the same and that we can work it out. There was a voice in the back of my head that knew it was only wishful thinking. Knowing that I was probably more upset about not wanting to be alone rather than the love lost. There wasn't any passionate, romantic love there, but there is love... I love who he is as a person despite the fact that he couldn't make me happy. I am happy he exists in the world... he's one of the good ones. 

He agreed to meet with me when I said that I wanted to talk and reconcile. For about three days I was really hopeful that he wanted me back, but it didn't take long to realize he didn't feel the same as I did. I wasn't mad... just disappointed. Disappointed and sad over what could have been. I can't beat myself up for the things I did that contributed negatively to the relationship because you can't control someone else's feelings. He never developed romantic feelings for me so... it doesn't matter what I could have done differently. He was right... dragging the relationship out would be a disgrace to our friendship. If we stayed together for another year, then what? At that point there would be too much baggage to salvage anything that was good. 

Asking someone to have me back after breaking up was a new experience. This was my second long term relationship so I still have a lot of lessons to learn in love. I told myself that I wouldn't beg, and I didn't but I did ask him a few more times than I would have liked if he thought he might change his mind. I now see why so many people wind up begging their exes to get back together with them. It's all so heavy and emotional. You're already lying yourself prostrate in front of them exposing your soft emotional underbelly so might as well go all out. Ugh, I don't ever want to be in that position again.

We hugged for a very long time crying... saying goodbye is the hardest part. Dragging the goodbye out was not very smart, but I couldn't let go of him. The physical touch... feeling their skin, the feeling of comfort their body gives you. We kissed for the last time. I felt sick to my stomach with grief. Then he left.

I hate to even post about this because it's so stupid, but maybe you guys can give me some sound advice.

I have been best friends with Sally* for 13 years... we have been through a lot. I moved out of state for college and we actually didn't talk for about 3 years. When I moved back about a year ago, things were back to normal, better even. We still remained really close. We started spending every day together, talking on the phone, constantly texting, etc. We became more like sisters.

She recently switched jobs and there a guy at her old job whom she had a crush on. A group of us would go out nearly every weekend to hang out. The guy she likes, Jake* is a really nice guy, mature, smart, funny, etc... He's a great guy for her. There has been a lot of sexual tension between them that she's told me about for the past couple of months.

Recently, they took a trip for her birthday, just the two of them. He took her out dancing, they had a romantic dinner, and eventually had sex and who knows what else. She told me all about it when she came back.

Now, in NO WAY do I have a crush on this guy, but I'm jealous. I'm jealous because I've had my string of bad guys who have broken my heart and messed with my mind and such. I want someone to treat me the way he treated her on their trip. I'm also jealous because (maybe this isn't true, but in my eyes it is) she's the skinnier (even though I'm skinny, too), prettier one of us. I'm working on my own self-confidence and trying to build up positive feelings about myself, but it's hard sometimes. I think she deserves the best, I really do. I love her, like I said she is more like my sister. I'm happy for her, but I'm also annoyed because it seems like now all she talks about is him. She's stopped texting me, she hasn't invited me over at all, she's not responsive to my texts and my suspicion is that she's been hanging out with him for the past couple of days. This would be fine if I didn't feel so neglected and hurt. I'm jealous because I think I deserve a great guy too, but I'm also worried about losing my best friend to him.

I know I'm going to get some harsh responses to this. I'm know I'm not being a good friend. I know I'm being a jerk by being jealous. I really am happy for her, but I feel neglected and alone.

How do I get over this? PLEASE say something other than ""you're an asshole, you're a bad friend"" because YEAH I already know that.

165909,Breakups,23jlni,"I met my ex-girlfriend whilst in my last year of sixth form, at 18 (I guess senior high school for some? I'm not too sure in that respect). I had never been in a proper relationship before and it wasn't something that had been a particular issue for me - it just wasn't something I had really thought about. I enjoyed being who I was and whilst I was open to a relationship I had never pined for one either. 

She was simply the most wonderful person I had ever met. She was so intelligent, loved literature, truly gave a shit about things, and was so dedicated to her future and more driven than anybody I knew. She was so reflective on life and, just everything about her was beautiful. She was also just unbelievably gorgeous and I still don't really understand how it happened. 

She had faults, as all people do. She was so focused on her schoolwork/grades as well as extra-curricular stuff that I was often pushed to the sidelines, making seeing her at times extremely difficult. I didn't care though - I guess this is because I was completely at her feet. 

We grew apart as a result - saw less and less of eachother, and when we did things got samey and not the same as they were at the start. I guessed the honeymoon period of the relationship was over, but I was still determined to make this work. Suffice to say, it didn't, and she broke up with me after 7 months. She told me it was because she didn't have feelings for me anymore and that she wanted me to be have someone who could reciprocate how I felt for her. This is obviously entirely fair and she did the right thing.

Months go by, we remain friends. Then I went to university. It took a few months and then we grew apart even more, to the point where we didn't even speak. The last time we saw each other was April 2012. She was drunk and stand-offish, as if she didn't really want a conversation. I couldn't really understand what I had done wrong - If I had done so I didn't know. I then a couple months later, feeling depressed, wanted to try and wrap this entire thing up and put it behind me - I couldn't stop thinking about her. I texted her in poorly phrased way which in hindsight sounded horrible and creepy and it all in all was an awful decision. When her close friend tweeted this - ""Omg, she doesn't even like you, what are you doing"" I texted her apologizing but stating I resented this, asking if I could just see her for ten minutes to get answers I needed, to wrap up loose ends and move on. She never replied and I deleted her number shortly after to prevent myself getting in contact with her again when drunk/vulnerable/whatever.

We haven't spoken since, yet I can't get over her. I do things like twitter/facebook/tumblr stalk her which I really, really hate myself for, as it is simply downright creepy and unhealthy. I still think of her as unlike anyone I've ever met. It's made my dating life an absolute nightmare. I've slept with a couple of people while at university in one night stands but the idea of having a girlfriend terrifies me. I'm scared of this all occurring again.

Now i have a part in this too. For 2 years, I've been battling game addiction. I asked her to be patient with me and I am trying to change. We recently went long distance and a number of things happened. First, I found space to reevaluate myself and realized that instead of gaming all day, i need to focus on school. I did focus a lot in school and I tried focusing on myself a little more. About a month ago,  I kicked my gaming habit and I legitmately had time again to focus on this relationship. 

Last night, i found out it was too late. She had told me she felt hurt before that gaming has been like a 'third wheel' I promised her id change but i needed time. Now that I've actually had time to focus on her, she told me she had feelings for someone else. She was very honest with me and regretted doing what she did. I asked her if she would have let it go on, would she eventually leave for him, she couldn't answer me. Before this, when it didnt go long distance, she never complained about my habits or anything. We were very much in love and trusted each other with our lives.  She asked me to forgive her and rebuild this relationship. 

I don't know how to react. I feel like giving her another chance because she did tolerate my obnoxiousness but at the same time, I've lost so much trust in her and in my mind, its hard to get over the fact that she has feelings for someone else and that she could have left for him.

The next time I saw him, we were talking and he said 'lets take a photo' and then asked me to fix his hair for him, i didn't but at this stage I began to actually have feelings for this guy, plus my long distance relationship was on the rocks and had been for a long time. I told the guy I was going to go home soon and he said he'd walk me to where I was getting collected. We sat and talked for a while, mostly him asking me to take a chance and that my boyfriend won't find out, I left and went home.

Me and my long distance boyfriend have now broken up (not due to this guy at all,) but since we have, I've developed feelings for this guy. I'm thinking of asking him to my prom also. I'm just unsure of how to know if he's trustworthy. How will I be able to tell if he's just looking for a hook up, or if he's genuinely interested in me?

He's pursued me multiple times, despite knowing that I was in a relationship and when I asked him why doesn't he go after any one of the other 100 girls in the club, he said cause they weren't me. When we were walking back, i took of my shoes cause they were killing me, and he made a comment on how cute i was because i was so small (I'm about 4ft 9 /5ft) How do I know if he's just a player? Regardless, I'm not looking for any serious relationship as I'm just out of one, but i still don't want to be used.

I found out one night when we were on the bed after he texted her something and we went through the messages (together) of what he wrote to her. He said something on the lines of ""sorry for coming on too strong, you're just really awesome."" I confronted her about it and she said it was during her coworkers party. She said that it was nothing and told him that she had a boyfriend. So I caved and told her I would trust her.


She continues talking to him and I confront her about him again telling her that it makes me feel uncomfortable when she talks to him.
She gets mad and started accusing me that I was being too jealous and that I should trust her to tell him off. She said he talks like this to everyone at work. I once again caved and told her I would trust her.


It wasn't until yesterday after we had a huge argument that I snooped and read her facebook messages. I know I am in the wrong for snooping and I feel guilty for doing it. After reading the messages he continues to do the exact same thing. Telling her to come to parties with as little clothes as possible. Calling her ""sweet (SO's name)."" There was a message in there where he asks her out."" She responded by saying ""He (me) is sitting right next to me."" It was as if she was trying to hide something. I found that she has been talking to him about personal issues with her life even our relationship issues. The same dude that tries to hit on her! 


I confronted her about it and she says he is her good friend and that if I can't handle it then I need to move on.

We've been arguing over this for a few hours now and I do not know what to do. I do not have anything to hide - I have never cheated on her nor even thought of it (I would not lie here she doesn't know my reddit name nor do any of my friends) but I don't think it is right for her to have access to all my messages with my friends etc despite them having nothing to do with her. It's literally like being with the NSA.

She told me that she has some sort of intuition but says that my behaviour is always normal and therefore bases her whole argument on an intuition. I categorically refused and she says that due to the fact that I'm not conceding she assumes that I have something to hide and will not accept the fact that I deserve some sort of privacy. There is nothing compromising on my account but why should she have access to conversations with my closest friends about matters that don't even concern her? 

What's rather strange is that I never did anything to make her doubt my fidelity and I've been explaining to her that she doesn't trust me, simple as that.

What to do? She won't budge nor will I - although I'm open to suggestions as to how to resolve this matter.

175063,Relationships,2qsbp5,"Hey everyone, looking for some advice right now because I'm in a bit of a stressful situation. My ex-girlfriend, Lauren, is extremely religious and wouldn't marry anyone who didn't share her religious beliefs. I wasn't very religious but I loved this girl a lot as we met in high school and grew together. I ended up getting baptized when I was 19 as I really thought I had a future with Lauren. To make a long story short, we kind of grew apart and had a pretty amicable split last year. 

I still went to church as I do see the morality of it and I made really good friendships with some of the people there who I could call some of my closest friends. I enjoy going but I basically just avoided all contact with my ex-girlfriend and her family. They do the same so other than some awkward encounters things have been pretty good. 

Fast forwarding to about 3 months ago I got very close to a girl named Alyssa. Alyssa is also in the church and she was one of the first people Lauren had introduced me to when I first started going. Alyssa came to be my girlfriend and I really like her a lot. No one really knew about it though because we both like to have privacy when it comes to our relationships. However, when Alyssa posted a picture on Instagram of me kissing her on the cheek on Christmas, all hell broke loose.

I seem to have lost all my friends when I attended church yesterday (Sunday). I usually show up right before service so i jump right in and socialize afterwards. No one wanted to talk to me. It was just awkward conversations all around. Lauren approached me for the first time and said, ""So you're with Alyssa now?"" When I said yes, she scoffed and rolled her eyes and walked away. All of my good friends I mutually share with Lauren and it feels like they're now taking sides, and it's not mine. I talked to Alyssa about it and she said if they're going to act like that then drop them, they aren't my real friends. But I felt like they were. They were good friends of mine, and while I have many friends outside of church, I still feel pretty bummed about the whole thing. 

I guess I'm posting to vent but also to ask for advice. What would you do in this situation? I genuinely care about these people and to see them pick sides like that really hurt me. I don't see what's the big deal because Lauren and I broke up a year ago but it's the outcome of me dating another girl is what made me second guess myself in staying in the church. I did and now I have a great girlfriend, but I didn't see all this coming.

It may have just been the day but I'll find out what the attitudes are like next Sunday. But until then I'm pretty bummed to say the least.

167765,Breakups,1kxqa9,"My ex and I have been broken up over two years. I left her after multiple accusations that I was cheating on her, or at least emotionally cheating by having other female friends, and after losing touch with basically every friend of the opposite sex that I had I knew something was wrong. I decided I was done letting her anxiety dictate my actions and life really, and ended things. After a rough breakup, where I tried to walk away and move on, she insisted on trying to be close immediately. After a few letters/emails where she tried to lay on some HEAvY guilt about how she would never forgive herself for losing me (I have a soft heart, and she did/said everything that she could to convince me I was making a mistake by ""throwing away what we had"", yikes), I made it perfectly clear that things were done. I angrily told her that the messages and attempts to talk normally weren't going to fly with me and that set off a chain reaction in which we didn't talk for 8 months. 

In the fourth month of this interim, I was informed by a mutual friend that she had been claiming to everyone that I had been both emotionally abusive (said that I called her names [false, called her an idiot once and even that I don't mind admitting because she had yelled at me for ""talking to other girls and hiding it"", and refusing to listen to my explanation that I was allowed to have conversations with people that she wasn't aware of, NOThInG inappropriate was said in any of these conversations for the record], that I screamed at her consistently [false, my roommates at the time said they had never so much as heard me raise my voice to her], that I would be so angry she would have to hide and cry in my bathroom [again, false; I can honestly say that I truly remember her running into my bathroom once and locking herself in there when I tried to explain that it was her anxiety, not my actions, that were making her so manic and upset about my inability to text her and only her]) AND that I was physically frightening (this was the one that bothered me most. The claim was that I had ""raised my fist in anger to her"" and this was the most ridiculous yet most hurtful accusation). I have never, in my life, raised my fist to a single living breathing organism on this planet, let alone every threatened anyone, let ALONE ever attempted to use physical means in an altercation with anyone whatsoever.

I was lucky. None of her friends believed it (I'm sure a few that I've since lost touch with did) which I only know because they one by one approached me to inform me of what was being said because they felt it was untrue and unfair. When I ended things, I told everyone the same stock answer: ""things didn't work out, I hope for the best for her"", leaving out the anxiety issues and telling my friends to stay friends with her (in hopes we would someday be friends too). But instead, she tried to make me into a monster.
Te story that I heard from her friends made it seem as though they were growing concerned for her well being, and she ended up seeking therapy. The first time we had spoken was after I informed a mutual friend that I was incredibly upset that she would make up such lies about me, aNd I guess that was filtered to her because the ex asked me to talk first. 

What I thought would happen was an explanation and apology for the rumours. What actually happened was her explaining how all of her anxiety wAs justified because I made her life so difficult, etc etc, with an absolute refusal to discuss the abusive rumours. 

We've tried to talk as friends, we've both since moved on and are dating other people, but anytime I've brought it up she says its a part of her past she doesn't want to discuss any longer.

I still feel like an anxiety ridden 20-something got away with telling a lie that could have ruined my life and luckily (thanks to just having a reputation as being a calm nnice and friendly guy) didn't. I even talked to my other exes to find out if they had ever felt emotionally or physically threatened by me. 

They all had the same reaction as my close friends. They laughed, and told me how ridiculous it was. I'm a lucky guy.

So, two years down the road, how do I forgive? How do I move past it? Closure is all that I want, because I can't hear her name without wishing I had gotten that apology for how lousy she treated my good name. I know I will never get it.

How to deal, reddit? Any words of wisdom?

I've been dating my boyfriend, (C) for two years. Everything was great at first - chemistry, attraction, sex, similar goals in life, sense of humor, etc. Naturally, after a while we introduced each other to our families. C told me in the beginning of our relationship that he had a turbulent relationship with his parents, but now that I know the full extent of it, I'm alarmed to say the least.


C's mother got pregnant with him when she was in high school. Her and C's father broke up when C was very young. After the break up, C didn't see much of his father. His father was an alcoholic, drug addict and an absent father to boot. C's mother worked several jobs to provide for herself and C. She received little to no financial assistance from her own family because they were beyond distraught to learn that she had gotten pregnant outside of wedlock. C's father never paid a penny of child support. C has told me that he spent most of his childhood plopped in front of a television set to keep himself preoccupied/supervised.


I have a strong suspicion that C's mother is an N. A few examples:
C was a drug abuser in his late teens/early twenties. He completed a few stints in rehab and is now completely clean. His mother talks about drugs (in general) and C's prior drug addiction (specifically) quite often. She never says things like ""I'm so proud of him for overcoming his addiction,"" or anything of that nature. All of her sentiments revolve around herself. ""I worked X amount of jobs to be able to pay for his rehab."" ""It was so hard on me. I was crying constantly."" ""I recently got botox because of the bags under my eyes that C gave me during his teen years."" Nothing is sacred or private to that woman.


C's dad was diagnosed with stage IV liver cancer in the beginning of last year. He died a few months after. During this time, C's mother made it all about herself. C's father reconnected with C during those final months. He took us out to dinner one night. C's mother's first question was ""He's not funnier than me, is he?"" Okay, odd. Maybe not N, but definitely abnormal. She also took every opportunity when C would leave the room to tell me about what a shit father C's dad had been. When we received a call from hospice to come immediately because C's father would die soon, C &amp; I showed up within minutes. As the end got closer, C asked me to call his mother and ask her to come to the hospital. She showed up 2 hours later because she ""had to take a shower and stop somewhere for coffee."" After his father passed, C's mother stood in front of C's father's extended family and offered to pay for the funeral luncheon. C's father's family does not struggle financially, so this was quite odd. Obviously, they were all in a daze and quite upset about losing their brother. C's mother was miffed at this and was actually pissed that they didn't thank her for offering to pay.


C announced to his mother that he was thinking about going back to college. She didn't congratulate him or ask questions, or even act excited. Her response? ""Good. You should go. My friend just decided to return to nursing school at age 45"" etc etc. Always making things about herself.


There are a number of reasons I think that C suffers from psychological trauma (or, I guess what are called FLEAS because of this)
If I'm crying, he doesn't hug me. He's horrible at comforting and showing affection.


-He drinks excessively. Not necessarily often, but when he does drink he will drink 10 or 15 beers until he's plastered and incoherent.
When he's feeling depressed he's saying things like ""I'm a black hole"" and ""I'm a shell of a person""


He's not thoughtful AT ALL. He's an excellent gift giver when it's expected (birthdays, Christmas, etc.) but he's never done any ""little things"" to show he cares, make me feel special, etc.


He's never been cheated on but is absolutely terrified of it. He even said to me in the beginning of our relationship ""If you ever want to cheat on me, just do me a favor and break up with me first. I don't want to look like an asshole by getting cheated on."" - absolutely no implication that it would affect him emotionally, just that he wouldn't want to look stupid by trusting someone who didn't deserve it.


He's hypersensitive and his number one coping mechanism is to be defensive. I can't say anything about his personality or his family or a problem in our relationship without him trying to 1) justify the behavior by accusing me of doing something (and, in essence, keeping score of our wrongdoings) 2) shutting down and stonewalling/giving me the silent treatment 3) raising his voice


If I tell him a story about my childhood or something that my family did that cost a lot of money or something, he feels the need to one-up it as if he needs to prove to me (and possibly himself?) that his mother loved him by spending money on him as well.


-I've never seen passion or true happiness in his eyes. His only ""hobbies"" are playing video games, drinking, watching TV, etc. (He does work full time, so he's by no means a bum, but those are the ONLY activities he does outside of work)


I'm at my wits end and I just need some input. I want to leave him if this will never change. I've tried to help but I believe this is bigger than our relationship. The change has to come from within, which will be especially hard for him because he has no analytic skills, is not self-reflective, and has a history of ""sweeping problems under the rug"" and repressing/trying to forget about them instead of solving them. I think his potential N mother's behavior has such a profound effect on him because she is C's only living parent, and even when his father was alive, he didn't have much of a dad in him. C's mother never married and is currently single and C is her only child, so a lot of her focus is on him. Please help. Thank you so much

I am a first year university student. 
I have been with my boyfriend for about 3.5 years, during that time we have lived together for about 3 years. At first he moved into my mums house, and then we rented our own place. Currently we live separately so that I can be closer to the university.

We spilt up briefly in August (after signing for a house in the city of my university) and then got back together, and we have been seeing each other every weekend since.

He's very caring, loving and supportive of my plans. We can have a laugh, but mostly we end up sleeping in late then getting stoned, watching TV and eating junk food. We don't go out often as we never really had the money. Financially it's not great. I've been trying to make up with money I didn't have last year from when I was in college, with the money I do have now from student loans.

The lease runs out on my flat soon and he wants to move to be with me and live together again. However I  feel like I don't want to be with him any more, I care for him but no longer love him. The age gap never used to bother me but recently it has, but that could be from being around younger people?
This makes me feel terrible. I feel like I've wasted his time and used him and I don't want to hurt him like I did in August. 
I'd like to try and talk it out with him, but I feel like breaking up may be the best thing?

Let me describe her. An amazing girlfriend. That's about it. Every time I broke up with her was for different ""reasons"" but the real reason was because I felt I was only with her because I knew she would never cheat on me and she was such a great girlfriend. Is that wrong?  She is the perfect girlfriend, I just don't think she was perfect for me. We get along great but we do not have the same interests. She does not challenge me and I feel like there could be some one better suited for me. I look at the world a lot different then her and feel someone might understand me better. I been reading a lot of things saying 'if you find a girl who does this this and that don't let her go' and she does everything. but then I feel like I'm just holding on because it would be dumb to let her go. She makes me happy. I'm comfortable around her. She genuinely cares about me. My family loves her . Always makes sure I eat. And just basically takes care of me. Am I a selfish for wanting to see if I have a better connection and find more in someone else. I really do not want to make the biggest regret of my life. I wanted to talk to a couples therapist, or anyone but don't have that money right now. So I came here for any help I can get. I literally been going crazy trying to figure out if I'm an asshole , if I should do everything I can possible to make it work. So any feedback will be appreciated. I will pm anyone with more questions. Thanks for reading.

We would always sit on one or the other's laps and browse cute and funny pictures of animals on reddit. And while we sat there, we were truly together. Neither of us ever liked getting up and continuing life. We just wanted it to pause for a while so we could spend an enternity sharing in the joy of eachother.

Come to think of it, there were many moments like that. Moments we just wanted to pause forever and never have to move on from. We were sure there would be better times ahead, but these moments we shared were so special and beautiful; it only made sense to wish they lasted forever.

When her and I would drive far, I would hold her hand and she would lean on my shoulder. Sometimes she would just look at me from the passenger seat, as if she was watching a sunset and smiling. And then she would cuddle back up to me again. I could see that smile out of the corner of my eye, and it always warmed my heart right up.

My girlfriend (34) and I (29) have been dating for quite some time now (7 years to be exact) and while I am blessed to have a beautiful woman by my side, it does bother me whenever we go out to certain bars when guys are drawn to her.  Not that she dresses slutty or anything like that, she knows how to dress and dresses classy while flaunting her assets (what woman doesn't enjoy showing off their bodies??) and thats fine with me, I love it when she dresses as such and draws the eyes of others (men and women), I love showing her off.  But what gets me is that when we're at a bar and I step out to the bathroom etc, guys always come up to her and start flirting and her first response is always ""I have a boyfriend"", some usually back off, most usually continue on, and so sometimes she will ignore them but there are times where she will talk to them if she finds them interesting, not that shes interested in them, but in a way she will flirt back.  They'll say how beautiful she is, how he deserves her, how he wants to take her home etc, and she'll laugh, I get it, it boosts her self esteem, her ego, thats fine.  But it really bothers me when this happens.  I never really had to worry about this early on in the relationship because she would always brush off any of the interactions.  However it seems that as of late she enjoys the attention.  She was never the type of person that cared about getting attention nor would she go out seek it, but I've noticed this change in her lately (I'd say in the last 3 years, I say that because we used to live together and then I moved away for family reasons 3 years ago and so we were apart doing the long distance, we didn't see anyone else during that time or took a break, none of that, we were committed to our relationship, and thankfully we're now back living together again).  I know she was depressed from being apart from me so she started going out with her friends more often  and I guess this is where the slight change happen, I understand, when you start getting attention you enjoy it, why not, it does boost your self esteem.  I know she would never cross the line or even do such a thing, but I guess from one perspective I could see it being it all in good fun.  I mean if I was as good looking as she was and women were always all over me, then yeah I'd most likely would enjoy the extra attention.  But I could see her getting upset if the roles were reversed.  

Anyways my question is, how do you handle the situation when your S/O is always drawing attention from others in places like bars and nightclubs etc, what do you do, how do you react?  I might re-edit this later to clear up my thoughts.  Oh and this is just when we go out together, I could only imagine what goes on when she's out with her girlfriends and guys are swarming around her.  She loves me.  I know that.  She's loyal to me.  I know that.  But its still annoying/frustrating when it happens especially when its happening when I'm right there or even nearby.  Am I overreacting?

Just got out of a LTR about a month ago. I really, really needwant sex and that is what I am currently looking for. However, I'm also not categorically opposed to something more serious if mutual feelings were to develop; that's just not my intention right now.


So I meet this guy a few weeks ago, we exchange numbers and hang out a couple times (once alone and once with friends; drinks). Without being too specific, the place where we met is somewhere where we will continue to run into each other on a regular (at least weekly) basis. The most recent time we hung out I decided to be very forward and told him about my strong craving to (in not-so-polite-terms) have sex with him.


We go back to his place and that's exactly what happens. It was amazing. From that one experience I can tell that we're sexually compatible and this is something I would like to continue to explore with him.


Also: normally I don't have this strong of a reaction with men, but in this particular case I really loved giving him head. I have learned to completely suppress my gag reflex and happen to also love swallowing, so when I find a dick I'm psyched on, well, it's really fun. Even if the focus from here on out was just on me giving BJs, honestly I'd be down.


So anyway, my questions are:
* I want him again and again. If this ended up just being a ONS I would be very sad panda. How do I bring this up without scaring him off?
* As I said earlier, I am not looking for a relationship but am not necessarily opposed to one if it feels right. Should I even bother to mention this, or only include the part about not wanting a relationship? (again with the not-scaring-off bit)
* This guy is pretty fucking rad and we had started what seemed like a friendship. Can I maintain being friends with him, e.g. hanging out alone or with mutual friends, or would this blur the casual line into relationship territory? Should I just focus on the sex from here on out?


I know the best course of action is to just talk to him about what I want. I will do this, soon. I feel like now is sort of a delicate time, since we had sex a few nights ago, and I would really like things to turn out favorably instead of scaring him off. Just looking for advice/perspective, if any of y'all have been in a similar situation. Thanks in advance!

Girlfriend, henceforth known as A, is an amazing person. She is beautiful inside and out. She is selfless, smart, kind, funny and very easy going. She doesn't cause drama or start fights for no reason. She is great in bed. Just an all around great girl.



I pursued her and we started going out. I was also the one to say I love you first. Now, here's the thing. The only issue A and I ever had was in relation to how she thought I was not there for her when bad things happened. A had a bad year. Her grandfather and grandmother died and her best friend developed cancer and then had an amputation. After finding out about each of these events, she would tell me and I would offer a platitude like ""sorry for your loss"" or ""prosthetics are great nowadays"" and then wouldn't bring it up again. 




The first few times I reacted this way, she calmly told me that when she is in a situation like what happened, she would like me to be there for her to support her. She told me support would be something like offering to meet up to give her a hug or calling her and asking how she is. She said she understood maybe I was uncomfortable doing that, so she would be patient. But it kept happening.




Fast forward to three weeks ago. Her grandma died and the same thing happened. I texted her saying, ""I am sorry for your loss. Hope you are okay"" and then ignored her for the rest of the day. The next day she told me that she was frustrated because this is the only thing she had ever asked me for and I wasn't getting it. We agreed to meet up and talk.




When we talked, she was very nice. She said she would work with me on these things and because she loves me, she didn't want to throw away our relationship. But the thing is, I was wondering why I wasn't there for her and why I couldn't console her and so at the end of the night I asked her for a break so I could take time to think. She cried but we agreed to a two week break.



During the break, I realized that I am not ready for commitment. I just don't want to lose my freedom and be vulnerable to someone. The problem is, I love this girl. She's one in a million and I don't want to lose her or hurt her. But I just don't think I'm ready for what she wants.



Fast forward to a few days ago. I break up with her because I just can't commit. She cries. She says she never brought up anything like moving in together, being engaged, etc. She says she never stopped me from doing anything and even encouraged me to go out with my friends more. She said she let me take communication at my pace. All of this is true but as undemanding as she is, I still can't be there for her. I broke her heart and I feel awful and I love her and miss her but I'm scared.



I thought we could stay friends and be in contact but she asked me to not contact her. I said I couldn't do that so she said at least leave me alone till the new year so she can move on and try and heal. The thing is, I know I don't want to commit but I love her and I'm hoping I come to my senses soon. I don't want to lose her from my life. But I will respect her wishes and leave her alone for the holiday season.

106398,Non-Romantic,1trk1p,"I left home and moved abroad when she was relatively young, around 7. Let's call her Sarah. She was always a bit of an attention seeking child but I think everyone thought she would grow out of it.

Now she's 15, I don't feel like I know her at all because every waking moment she seems to put on an act. She is constantly exaggerating her reactions to things, and I mean it's really obvious, like standing dumbstruck with her jaw hanging for 10 full seconds in response to someone saying something she has perceived as 'mean' or whatever. She seems to put so much energy into maintaining this weird persona of a crazy, ditzy, exaggerated person... but she does it all the time. She never seems to let this act down. Maybe she really is this way, but it just seems forced and pretend. It's hard to describe, maybe someone knows what I mean?

I'll list some examples of her problematic behaviours:

**Sometimes she just makes stuff up**. She'll start telling a story extremely earnestly, and make up some wild detail, and I'll say, 'That's not true is it?' and she'll giggle and say 'no!' and start making something else up instead. This happens ALL THE TIME. She also talks incessantly, and if she has nothing to say she'll just make things up, and if she gets caught, she giggles or occasionally deny it. 

**She's extremely childish still**. Like for instance, the other day our youngest sister wanted my Skype username, but Sarah refused to give it to her. She plays dumb thoughtless 'jokes' like purposely getting a hairbrush caught up badly in my hair. She got upset because my brother shot a horse dead in a video game. 

**She has mood swings.** This may be normal for a teenager but my other siblings haven't had mood swings to this level, so it's worth mentioning I guess. When she has a mood swing, which usually is unprompted, she'll act like a total bitch. There's no other word to describe it. She is vindictive and calculated, and she'll do things to make herself seem like the victim. For instance, she started a food fight on holiday recently, and in retaliating, our youngest sister (accidentally) stained Sarah's dress with wine. Sarah started crying, refused to accept that she'd started it, and also refused to soak the dress in water to help remove the stain, and refused to let me help to soak her dress even though I told her it would come straight out if she let me. She then disappeared into the holiday home, but opened the window of the bathroom so that she could lean out and occasionally interrupt our conversations with nasty snipes - directed at all of us even though, except for our other sister, we'd not been involved. Also, she turned off the air conditioning so the apartment got really hot and we'd be uncomfortable, and when nobody noticed she did it at first, she started dropping hints about it. I mean, who even thinks of something that petty to do?

Anyway, there's probably more stuff but this is starting to look a bit like a wall of text. She's my sister, and I love her, but I don't know how to deal with her behaviour and I don't know why she's like this. It's really full on, like all the fucking time. Does anyone have any advice? Is this just an awkward phase? Is there some way I can try and talk to her, help her out of it? 

The thing is, she's coming to stay with me for over a week tomorrow, and I'm afraid her tantrums and attention-grabbing are going to ruin the holiday for the rest of my family...

I constantly vocalize my adoration and attraction to him, and I feel like I'm just not getting it in return.

This is my first post, so I apologize for formatting issues.

My ex-gf (current gf, I don't even know) met almost two years ago today in a class at college. We hung out for a few weeks and then started dating.  I was at first physically attracted to her, but the more I got to know her I fell in love with her intellect and how we had extremely similar interests.  We grew so close, but went through a stressful few months this past summer when she went back home (lives in one state, goes to school in a different state) and I was looking for a job upon graduation.  

When she returned to school this past August she said that she can't be in a relationship at this time.  She stated that this past summer was very hard on her emotionally and she needs some time for her to find herself (I'm her first serious bf, she's not my first serious gf).  She refuses to give an answer as to when we can reevaluate this relationship.  She told me she still loves me and wants to be with me in the long-term but can't be with me right now.  I asked her if she wanted to hook up with other people and she told me absolutely not and would be upset if I did the same.  We text a couple times a week and I've seen her maybe every other week.  (I found a job in the same town as I went to college).

I understand she is confused and needs space, but I'm not willing to give up my best friend.

Do I wait around for her to figure herself out in this uncertain time or try and close this chapter of my life.

138797,Relationships,29s5rm,"So, I am bothered by the way my girlfriend acts when it comes to dealing with other men.

I have talked to her about it, and she has made certain changes, and while she agrees with the general idea that at times she has had issues with boundaries and setting limits, she also thinks I'm being irrational and jealous.

I can't for the life of me figure out whether this is all me being irrational and insecure, or if it's that she's too loose with her boundaries.

I will give you some examples of some of her male ""friendships"" and let you draw your own conclusions.. I'm very curious to get third party feedback.

Guy A - She has been platonic friends with him for years.  Nothing has ever happened between them, aside from him making a half-hearted advance on her one time, years ago, which she claims she quickly shot down.  That said, they used to go on what she called ""date night"" where they'd go out to dinner and then to a bar for drinks.  This even happened while she and I were together, it has stopped recently as I've told her I'm no longer comfortable with it.  When she sees him now, I'm always there.  I'm friendly with him too, but sometimes it feels weird, like I'm ""crashing"" their date and like they'd both be happier if I wasn't there.  She claims I'm wrong about that, that she wants me there.  But, for his part, I'm fairly certain he resents me being around and wishes he could have his ""friend"" back.  When they're around each other and I'm sitting there, they will spend the majority of their night talking to each other and they frequently go outside to smoke, even though oddly enough he never seems to smoke except when my GF is around.  She will caress his arm while they talk, they hug and kiss hello and goodbye, and she often touches him on the shoulder or back while they're talking.

Guy B: Is a guy who me and her met on the same night.  The two of them hit it off and began talking and texting a lot - she was telling me about it and what they were talking about, etc.  It got to a point where she was talking about him so much that it started to bug me, so I asked her to stop talking about him so much.  He invited us over to dinner a few times, felt awkward to me.  A mutual friend of ours, who was this guy's room mate, ended up telling him that she (the mutual friend) felt that it was disrespectful of him to be texting her so often and that he should knock it off because she's in a relationship.  His response was to say that ""if she's going to cheat on him, why would it matter if its with me!"" etc.  After many arguments and much fighting, she finally agreed to stop talking to him all the time and she de-friended him on facebook.  She claims that she originally thought it was innocent and that I was just jealous, but after hearing his comment to our mutual friend, she finally realized that I was right and that he had ulterior motives.  She no longer speaks to him and says I was ""right"" about him, but, I think she also secretly thinks I'm crazy and that it was no big deal.

Guy C: A guy she had a crush on years ago, for a good chunk of time.  She eventually made a move on him, they had sex.  Next day he told her it was a mistake, that they should just be friends.  So, they've been ""friends"" ever since, though it seems to be mostly her trying to maintain the friendship, and he only seems to communicate with her when he needs audience members for his band.  She drags me to his shows and gets so excited whenever she's about to see him, etc.  Makes me feel icky.

Guy D:  A dude she had an online relationship with when she was 19.  She thought they were ""in love"" and was prepared to move across the country to be with him, but he ended up marrying someone else.  His marriage to the other girl failed, and now he still talks to my GF from time to time.  She claims they're just friends and haven't seen each other in years, but I think it's weird that they're still friends on facebook and still talk.

Guys in general: She is flirty, talkative, engaging in conversation, very social, makes herself very open and whatnot.  She often makes physical contact during conversation, will caress an arm, rub a shoulder, will give a hug goodbye where after the hug she'll sort of quickly run her hand down a rib cage, etc.

So, that's some examples...

Am I insane, or is she a cheater?

32077,Dating,3c9zsd,"Ugh, ok excuse the bible im writing here I'm a tad flustered and dont want to leave out any details. So, potential gf lets call her brit. Her and i have been seeing each other for a few weeks, probably like 6 or 7? Not sure. She live kinda far so dont get together too frequently but we what we can.

 Anyways, brit has also been seeing a friend of mine, who we can call Ian, for about 2 or 3 weeks now. The time of this im very unsure of but it will make more sense the further i explain.

So brit hasn't told me any of this. Another close friend, Meg, who has a thing for Ian, told me about all of what Ian and Brit had been doing. She wasn't supposed to do this, her and i are good friends and she felt i needed to know. Ian has been talking to Brit about telling me all of this and figuring out what we are doing as of the development of Brit and me's relationship. Agian nothing from Brit or Ian. 

I've known about this for maybe 4 days now, constantly talking to Brit. She shows no sign of dislocation or being removed from me. She actually seemed more into our usual Netflix dates than before. We've done more than tht for dates.

I saw Brit yesterday, which where I found her to be more enthusiastic about doing things. I took her to dinner and then planned to take her home, about 3 quarter's of the way through dinner she says she's going to her friend's for the night. At this point my phone dies. She told me that her parent's were ok with so i had no interjection. I was supposed to go to my friend's house as well after i had dropped her off but at this point she was going much further than i was and out of my direction. We leave i go with her almost the whole way to meet her friend. With my phone dead i ask if i can use hers to message my friend to tell him ill be a bit late and that ill be there shortly, Ian sends her a message saying ill see you soon.

 This made me visually miserable, i tild her i had to go my friend is really starting to get upset, so I said bye and got off if the train without our usual good bye and ended up at my friends. 

Today she's been very distant, and not really replying. Meg has been keeping me sane for the day because she is pissed at Ian for doing this but they're kinda irrelevant. 

I feel that im stuck because i like Brit and want to be with her but she's off doing this amd not mentioning it to me. I had to find out from someone who has never even met Brit. I cant call her on it, there's no way i could know to her knowledge. I'm starting to think that if this is happening and we aren't a couple should i even want to get involved with someone who wont tell me something like that? I don't know what to do and im tied with aggression because i feel like i cant do anything.

 Ian, I find is instigating the situation so i dont wanna blame Brit completely. Ian knew from mid june i was seeing her so he's more than aware of me.

TL;DR: Potential gf is seeing one of my friends, I'm not supposed to know about any of it. She acts fine one day, the next she's distant and unresponsive. What do i do?

160278,Relationships,1r322b,"Last month my boyfriend of 18 months became my fiancé and I am thrilled about it, but I feel a little guilty and feel like I need to tell him about a wild night I had just before we became intimate.

Jim and I met when we were both cast in a community theater play. Lots of chatting and hanging out during rehearsals, backstage and at the bar after the show proved that we were a good match for each other and I really liked Jim right away. However, Jim was very slow to make his move (and I was even unsure if he was ever going to make one), so when I heard from an old fuck buddy of mine, I took the call.

I hadn’t seen Steve in about six months, but that was okay, we could go months without hearing from each other. Steve was a very handsome man and spectacular in bed, but somewhat self-centered, so I never really wanted a relationship with him, but we were very sexually compatible.

Once, Steve and I had confessed to each other our sexual fantasies. Steve’s was a fairly normal submissive thing that I could easily make come true. Mine was a lot darker in that I wanted to be fucked by three guys at the same time in every hole. Steve was very turned on by the idea, but nothing ever came of it.

Steve called me to say that he had two old college buddies in town and the three of them were looking for some fun and wanted to know if I was up for living out my fantasy. He even texted me a picture of the three of them and they were a good looking bunch. I thought about Jim for a second, but I didn’t know if anything was going to happen there and I really wanted to fulfil this fantasy at least once in my life, so I said yes and drove over to Steve’s house.

I’m not going to go into great detail here, but I will say that I really loved it. It was a bit overwhelming at first, and I kept asking the guys to slow down. They were very good about listening to me and did whatever I asked, but I still was having trouble getting into the swing of things. Then one of the guys had some joints and suggested we get stoned and that relaxed me quite a bit and I just let things happen.

I felt so wonderful and so slutty and when I had each of them inside of me at the same time I had the most intense orgasm of my life. I let each of them pull off their condoms and finish on my face and tits, so I was covered in cum when the evening’s activities were over. 

Steve invited me to crash at his place, which I accepted and the next morning we did it all over again, although this time I was completely sober and it was just as fulfilling.

I showered and left to go to our Sunday matinee performance and I felt really guilty when I chatted with Jim, but knew rationally that there was no reason for me to feel that way.

The next weekend, finally giving up on Jim making the first move, I gave him a long, deep kiss goodnight. He reciprocated the kiss and we wound up back at my place fucking all night long and we have been together ever since.

I considered asking Jim if he wanted to have some sort of poly-session with me, but when he found out a girlfriend of mine had been in a MMF threesome, he was grossed out by the whole thing. So I never went through with asking him about it or even confessing that I had been gangbanged.

Jim is an awesome guy and we have a great relationship, we are usually very open with each other and our sex life is wonderful. I’ve never told him about my gangbang, but we have talked to each other in general terms about our past sexual history (like how many partners we’ve had, strangest place, etc.) And while I really enjoyed my foursome, if I never have another one again, I won’t have any regrets.

Here’s my question: Now that we are engaged, should I ever tell Jim I had this experience? I feel like if I do, he will lose all respect for me as he did for my girlfriend and I think it would ruin our relationship. If the gangbang hadn’t been the week before we started dating, I would have no qualms about keeping this a secret, but for some reason it feels like I cheated on him and it bothers me somewhat that I haven’t told him.

EDIT: Thanks for all the advice. I've decided I don't need to tell him unless I am asked directly.

I am a 6'2 male that is an avid athlete and I eat a ton of food. Because my sport is weight-specific, I tend to view food mainly as fuel. This doesn't mean that I don't appreciate food -- I recently attempted a pretty tasty Bo Ssam (Korean BBQ) amongst other complicated recipes -- but I'll almost always pick the healthy+frugal option over the elaborate+butter-finished option.

You can see where this is going...

My girlfriend is a ultra-picky when it comes to food -- not in terms of variety, but in terms of quality. We've basically stopped eating out because she's never satisfied with the quality of food unless we're pushing a $150 bill. I'm not exaggerating when I say that I've literally seen her starve herself rather than eat mediocre food. Lucky for her she's also a fantastic cook, so we end of eating in most of the time.

Normally I just suck it up and pay for her food (or at least pay for the majority of the groceries, since I do eat more than her -- I've always had a pretty well-paying job so it's never been an issue), but we're both currently unemployed and looking for jobs and money is tight. She's unwilling to shop anywhere besides Whole Foods and won't entertain the option of compromising on her food-quality-of-life.

So basically we've started making two trips to two different grocery stores -- I'll try and buy what I can for cheap, and then she'll buy her premium stuff from Whole Foods. Since she won't let me cook for her and usually won't want to eat what I want to make anyway (she needs it to be fresh-caught shrimp instead of beef), she ends up cooking dinner for the two of us most nights.

She's starting to feel resentful that she's doing all of the cooking and that I'm eating the expensive food that she's paying for. I've offered to make separate dinners together or to pay for everything expect the premium ingredients, but none of these have struck her as fair compromises. I'm not really sure what to do outside of just paying for her to make us both dinner every night (which she also agrees would not be fair).

112072,Relationships,3du1kx,"I want to keep this as brief as possible, but sorry if it becomes a wall. She started a new job about a month ago- I was very supportive. Over the past 3 weeks, though, things have changed. I saw that she was very disinterested in my presence in general, and always said she was tired. Sex became much less frequent, and she was just very distant. I respected her space.

A few days ago, she tells me she is uncertain of her life choices and if she is happy with her new job. After a long discussion, I asked if he was questioning 'us.' She replied she did question us. I was a bit hurt but remained composed. That night was rough, and I did something that was probably wrong- I VERY briefly looked through her phone. Just when I was satisfied there was nothing, I accidentally clicked her email and saw she was emailing this guy..all I saw was 'lol lets get muffins' and that was it. It meant almost nothing to me.

The next day, she is apologizing for questioning everything about us and says she really wants to marry me and mushy gushy shit. I pretty much accept this. I asked her if she met someone at work that sparked this- she assured me that there are no guys at work that are even her age, and the ones that are she doesnt know their names. This was fishy, because I was sure the guy on the email was a coworker.

Tonight, I went through again, very very briefly and all I could read was ""he is my boyfriend of course I like him.... I didn't say I don't find other people attractive."" something along those lines. I only have a few seconds while she is out of the room.

Over the past year I have started to put the pressure on for marriage. It just makes logical sense. I’ve known for a while that life was going to start taking us in the direction that it takes most everyone; buying cars, paying health insurance, buying a house, starting a family etc. He’s gotten frustrated with me saying that I’m pressuring him and he will do it in his own time. I agreed to lay off but now were about to start the ball rolling on a big life event. 


So we’ve decided we want to buy a house. We pay a lot in rent and would rather be putting it towards a mortgage. We have 2 dogs that need a lot of space and an apartment without a yard just isn’t cutting it. Plus we’re both home bodies and the space of an apartment is just not enough. 


So my issue is, this is a huge financial investment for both of us. I cant take it lightly, I know that there are potential huge ramifications for entering into a mortgage without first being married. 


For instance, if we should break up we’d have to figure out who gets the house, how they’d pay for it, how to split it between us etc. Or if one of us should all of a sudden decide to walk away and never look back the other is going to be stuck paying a mortgage they probably cant afford alone. 
 

If we’re married it seems like we have laws to help protect each of us, whereas without that it’s going to have to be a mutual decision unless we draft a contract before hand.


I explained this to my boyfriend, that this is a huge deal and I am not really comfortable entering into this financial commitment without first having the emotional commitment behind it, marriage.

He told me that he does plan to get married but he didn’t want to talk about it, that he’s not going to leave me with the mortgage and I need to stop worrying. 


I pushed the subject more and told him not only is it a financial issue it is going to be a social issue as well. He has a very conservative family, who aren’t even that comfortable with us living together, I cant image what they’ll say when they find out this plan. I also mentioned it to my step mom who was against it because of the fact that we’re not married. 


He rationalized it with people can think whatever they want, who cares.


I knew the conversation was not getting anywhere so I just made a personal plea and told him that this is something I feel strongly for, that marriage, or at the very least an engagement, should happen before we enter into this.


He didn't have a lot to say, like I said he gets annoyed when I nag about marriage, but he told me he heard my concerns and he understands. 


So I guess I just want others inputs and opinions on the matter. Those who bought houses with their significant others before marriage did it work out? What are some other potential down sides?


Also, should I stick to my guns and really insist on being married/engaged first or should I let it go. 


TL;DR-We want to buy a house but I want to be married first, and he’s not concerned with that. I would like some outside perspective on the issue.

My husband shouldn't have to explain to his dad how I have student loans and that I need to work. My husband shouldn't be treated so poorly as he is a good man and a good muslim. 



I am sick of my in-law's high expectations. The fact is - I married my husband who wanted a girl who didn't drink, do drugs, gamble, and at least attempted to fast during ramadan while also being a lover of his interests (i.e. traveling, boardgames, figurines etc) and being childfree and so on. We really match well together, but I will never be the Daughter in law my husband's dad expects of me. 



I don't want my husband to be stuck between a rock and a hardplace or feel like he has to choose between me and his family. If it comes down to it, should I just divorce him? Help him find that obedient girl? One who will put up with his dad's antics/bullshit? 



I love my husband. I don't want to, but I am sick of seeing him hurt. Like tonight he is hurt and worried. I hate that. I just want our happy home and happy life- not stress.



**TL;DR**: My farther-in-law's sexism drives me up the wall and causes fights between FIL+husband, FIL+me, and me+husband. I want it all to stop and for my husband to have peace. Should I divorce him, and help him find a more obedient less equality-for-all girl?

My husband and I have been together 8 years, but only married mid last year. Everything was going great, he recently landed this amazing new job with a bigger salary and it requires regular overseas travel. We also started trying for a baby when we got married and I am now 12 weeks pregnant.

He went for his first overseas work trip three weeks ago and just got home earlier this week. While he was away, nothing seemed suspicious. We FaceTimed every day and texted regularly, he was buying things for our baby over there and all was swell.

I picked him up from the airport and we were chatting on the drive home and he mentions having breakfast on his last day with a friend he made and said she had him trying all these local foods. Something twigged, he had never mentioned this new female friend in any of our conversations while he was away, and the colleague he travelled with is male. What was he doing meeting a woman for breakfast? But I put it down to me being paranoid and ignored it.

Today, I was at work and it just kept niggling at me. So, I did the wrong thing and logged into his email account and low and behold, he had emailed at least a dozen explicit photos of this woman (selfies taken in her home, by the looks of it) to a secret email address he had created. So I hacked my way into that email too, and they have been emailing back and forth for a week, as recently as half an hour before I discovered the emails. I wish I took screenshots but at this point I had just lost my mind.

I told work I was sick and had to go, and drove home to confront him. He denied it at first but broke down when presented with the evidence. He cried and cried and apologised repeatedly. He said he met her one Saturday night when he was really drunk, they flirted heavily and kissed. He swears up and down that they didn't have sex, and their emails seem to confirm this. I am sure they planned to see each other again though, as she mentions looking forward to March which is when his next trip is pencilled in for.

So, now what? He appears genuinely remorseful. He has an admitted problem with alcohol and has made an appointment with a therapist to start dealing with it. I am considering giving counselling a go before walking away. I would find this whole thing easier to try and forgive if it had ended that drunken night, but to carry on emailing each other for a week afterwards?! This is his FIRST trip for just 3 weeks and he has already cheated on me. But what do I do??? I didn't plan on being a 27 year old divorcee single mother. But I also don't want to live a life with someone I don't trust. I feel like my whole life is a fucking joke. Is there any recovering from this? At this point, I don't know what to do. I haven't told any family or friends because I feel so embarrassed that he has done this to me, while he was away I was singing his praises and sharing our baby news with people and looking forward to our future. And now he has just shit all over it.

I have control of the email address they were using, due to the large time difference she wouldn't have seen the email he sent (at my insistence) to cease contact, I am tempted to email her and get her side (assuming she would reply). Should I? She is married too, and knows about me. I hate them both right now.

Sorry this is a jumbled mess of a post, I feel a complete mess.

Edit: Thank you all so much. I really didn't expect this to get so many replies. I have read them all and am thinking about everything you have said. I need to try and sleep now because it's late at night here and I have to work in the morning, but will be back soon to read any new replies. You have given me a lot to think about. This is definitely the most difficult day of my life so far.

45790,Relationships,3b4ggw,"Hi all. So I am currently living/working abroad for the next year or so. Before I left, I had been dating a guy for three months and things were actually going pretty well. He was aware that I was planning to go abroad when we first met, and right before I left we talked about whether or not to do a LDR. Ultimately, we decided against it since our relationship was still very young and we were both worried that it might ruin things. So, we decided to keep in touch while I was away and go back to being friends, with the idea to start dating again when I got back if we were both still interested. 



A thing about me: I'm an introvert, the kind that can go to parties and be social but I have to have some alone time to recharge or I can completely burn out. He's an extrovert, the very social kind, who loves being around tons of people and has about a thousand facebook friends compared to my very close-knit group. I feel that this factors in to my current dilemma. 



So I've been away for about half a year now. Before I left, we had a really amazing date that pretty much guaranteed to keep him constantly on my mind. I wanted to talk to him often, which he told me was fine, but after a while I began to notice that I was messaging him more often than he was messaging me. Not wanting to come off as clingy and to give him some space, I decided to back off and let him be the first one to message me this time. 



That was a month ago, and aside from occasionally liking or commenting on something I post to Facebook, he hasn't messaged me to set up a Skype call or even just to say hello. It's making me nervous, but I'm not about to start making assumptions when we're separated by a friggin' ocean. He runs his own business and, like I've said before, he's a very social person. We've agreed to be just friends so it's not like he owes me anything. At the same time, I'm reminded of something another super-extrovert friend explained to me; about how if someone stops talking to her she immediately begins to wonder why they don't want to hang out with/talk to her anymore--and I'm curious if that might be at play here. 



There's a good chance that I'm overthinking things, but I'm just wondering whether I should stick to my radio silence policy or just message him to check in. He's important to me, even as only a friend, and I know that he would never deliberately try to hurt me. Any and all advice is really appreciated, thanks! 


   

**tl;dr**: Separated for a year. Just friends until I get back. Frequent messaging on my end caused me to stop and give him some space, but he hasn't contacted me in over a month. To break the radio silence policy or no?

She is very flirtatious.  She knows she's flirtatious, and she does it for the attention.  She absolutely craves the attention. 

She gets very close, gives very intimate hugs, rests her head on my shoulder, puts her hand on my waste which is very close to my ass. 


Often times I succumb to her and give her the attention she wants because I am, in a way, attracted to her.  I'm only physically attracted to her, and I know it's partially my fault because I mislead her and, again, give her attention. 

I give her long gazes in the eye, I get close, I buy her things, and I try to talk as smoothly as I possibly can.  Examples of buying her things would be a pricey but fair lunch from Buffalo Wild Wings during our breaktime, some candy, and other various small things. 

An example of me trying to be smooth would be the following:

     Her: ""Hey, I was gonna ask you a question, but I forgot."" 

     Me: ""Oh, were you going to ask me for a kiss?"" 

Very cheesy, nonetheless, she reacted positively to the attention and laughed and got pretty close to me like I wanted her to.

As you can tell I am pathetic.  I need to find a way to repel myself from her rather than see her as the hot co-worker that I can't have because she has a boyfriend that she talks about non-stop.  


I want to stop our flirting before I ruin my reputation as a worker, empty my wallet, and ruin her relationship with her boyfriend. 

The confusing part is that she flirts with EVERY guy at the workplace.  They don't ask for it, but lo and behold she is there to flirt with them, too, despite her relationship with her boyfriend who has already told her that he is uncomfortable with her working there due to the amount of customers and co-workers that hit on her and flirt with her.

____________

**BACKGROUND:**

Carl and I tell each other EVERYTHING. I've been in several long-term relationships (lasted 3 years, 1 year, 4 years), and he has been by my side through every heartbreak. He's only casually dated people for about 2-3 months and has hooked up with many girls (probably over 20+ since I met him). He told me about all these girls he met, what girls he really liked, problems/fears. I did the same. I was very self-conscious, was a virgin when we first met, and he always talked me through it and made me feel better. Also, he has a very small circle of friends (4 people?)
At the end of my longest serious relationship, he made me promised him: ""When meet that great guy, promise that you won't stop talking to me. Always tell each other everything. Best friends forever."" I was like, sure no problem, it's obvious that I will never do that to him.

____________

**Carl meets Amy**

He met this girl, let's call her Amy, and he was completely smitten by her. I loved her as well! A little bit about her: She is 21, on her visa (from the middle east), extremely sheltered and religious (orthodox catholic). When Carl and I usually hang out, I always included Amy. She seemed to like me, but then a few months into the relationship, Carl told me she got mad because I texted him about something and didn't include her. So I created a group text message to make everyone happy. Also, I was in a relationship as well. 

____________

**I don't know what happened**

My last relationship ended in April. Carl was still there for me, but not as much. We hang out once since then (with Amy). The last time he texted me was the beginning of June after I had my first one-night stand, and that was the last thing we talked about (not sure if this could be relevant). I contacted him and her, saying we should hang out again...and they both sounded excited, but never followed up as much as I kept trying to...

____________

**Engagement**

Two weeks ago, I found out on *her* Facebook that they were engaged. I texted both of them, one very last time to congratulate them..and both thanked me casually. 


**Today, my best friend is getting married at the courthouse.** And I found that from her Facebook as well.

____________

I keep coming up with these conclusions, because they have been together for less than a year, both are still living with parents and still in college:

* He's letting our friendship go and moving on to the marriage life.
* She's not letting him contact me anymore. She is very strict and traditional.
* He got her pregnant and is too embarrassed. (Eh, might be too extreme)

""When meet that great guy, promise that you won't stop talking to me."" &lt;- I kept my promise all those years. Life goes on; people change. it's just a bit saddening.

~~~~~


When I was 16, I was dating some guy (won't name him because he's not important), said guy acted like a total dick at my big brothers wedding, and I ended taking him outside and telling him to go home and I'd deal with him tomorrow. A little later on in the night my big brother's best friend at the time (we'll call him Joe, age 22) noticed I was sitting outside by myself smoking, and came out to ask me what was wrong, told him my boyfriend was a dick and I was breaking up with him tomorrow. Joe sat with me for a while and we had another cigerette before he went back inside. He ended up asking me to dance at some point after that, and throughout the night we talked a good bit and ended up swaping numbers. Admittly I fell head over heels for him, had a crush on him since I was 12, and the fact that he was paying any attention to me at all was seriously something. Next day I broke up with 'someguy' and a few days after that Joe asked me out on a date.


Joe and I become offical right before Christmas that year, and moved in together 3 months later. We hardly ever fought and everything was seemlying perfect. However, right after our 1 year anniversary things went downhill quick, we fought a lot, he got really quiet towards me. I got really drunk one night and ended up cheating on him (I still feel bad about it honestly.)


1 year 2 months into our relationship, and he broke up with me. He called from work, said he was going to a friends house, and we had to talk when he got home.  I knew it was coming, and waited for 3 hours before he got home. I was a nervous wreck. When he did finally get home and we sat down to talk, it lasted a whole 10 minutes. Within 10 minutes he told me he was going to stay with his mom, and I had a month to get out of the house and find my own place, he started to cry, then left.


A week later he came over to talk, and my dad stopped by too. My dad told Joe that he was the best thing that ever happened to me and he was really sad to see this happen. My dad has never said anything even remotely like that to any of my boyfriends since.


I broke right down for the most part, couldn't eat for weeks, lost a bunch of weight, but eventually I 'got over' him. I eventually found out the reason he left me was because he had cheated on me early on in our relationship, and had gotten one of his 'friends' pregant, and left me so he could be with her and raise the baby. Over time I came to respect that, and realized I was still a teenager at the time, and he was in his early 20's, and nobody's perfect. They ended up getting married and had 3 kids total.


I've dreamt about Joe at least Every 6 months for the last 6 years though, and I've never loved anyone quite like I did him.


Eventually I found myself dating an emotionally/had come close to physically abusive mentally ill asshole. I had tried leaving him before, he but freaked so bad I stayed. I ended up getting pregant and left said asshole for good.


~~~~~


I'm now 24 year olds, with a 4 year old autistic little boy, and dating a great guy. But this is where it starts to get complicated. My current boyfriend (we'll call him Bobby, age 28, current age 30) really is a great guy, but he is the most complicated person I've ever met in my life. I also want to mention that Bobby has never dated anyone before, and I'm the first person he's ever opened up to about anything.


Bobby and I met online, and talked for months before meeting in person. He believed he was asexual at the time, which was fine, we were only friends to begin with, we actually never intended to start a relationship, however after months of getting to know him in person, I fell for him pretty hard, and he ended up developing feelings for me too. After a lot of hardships we found ourselves in a serious relationship.


Bobby has a rare fetish, fabric. I'm not sure if there's an actual name for it or not. Basically if it's really soft, fuzzy, furry, silky, ect. rubbing it on himself gives him sexual pleasure. Because of this fetish, the biggest hardship we've had is that I had to give up doing crafts. When he sees fabric or anything like fabric being cut, he described it as physically hurting him, like I was cutting into his chest every time I cut the fabric. I gave them up willingly at the time, but over the last year it's been eating at me more and more as the days go by. Some of my first memories are of doing crafts with my mom, and it feels like I've litterly lost a part of who I am. Not being able to do crafts really bothers me, but because of how he feels towards the topic I don't even wanna bring it up.


We've run into many simular issues before... for example, I got a pair of socks for christmas, and he liked them so much he wanted a pair for himself. We went to the store and get them but they were sold out, and he got super depressed, and eventually asked me if he could have them. I know they're just socks, but it bugged me because that was my Christmas gift, and I felt like if I didn't give them to him, he was just going to continue being depressed.
Bobby is a very sensitive guy, things get to him so much and so badly that he just goes into himself whenever he's upset, it's really hard for him to talk about any problems he has. But when he does it's almost always something like this. The pattern is I have something he really likes and wants, and that bothers him because he knows it's wrong to ask for it, but if he doesn't it'd bother him more. The only way for it to be solved is for me to give up whatever it is he wants willingly so everyone can be happy. He's told me before he hates that about himself and is kind of scared for the day I say no to something.


Bobby also has other fetishes, balloons, pool toys, and stuffed animals. He also enjoys anal and is quite submissive in the bedroom. I've tried to satisfy every single one of his sexual needs, but it's starting to feel more like a chore. I'm also starting to feel slightly resentful towards him in a sexual way because after everything I've done for him, he refuses to even try giving me oral. I've basically had to accept that I will never recieve oral sex so long as we're together. I've pretty much lost my sex drive, most of our sexual experiences when we do have them are me helping him with one of his fetishes. We have actual sex maybe 3-4 times a month at best. I used to be a very sexual person but sex just doesn't seem appealing anymore.


These are all of my red flags that we don't work, and I should end things...
But it get's more complicated...


I love Bobby, but I think I fell out of love with him quite some time ago. Bobby really is a great guy, and was one of the best friends I ever had, but as time goes on I feel like I'm drifing apart from him. We may care about each other a lot, but we just don't mix in that way... we were better as friends. I feel like I can't leave the relationship because I don't want to hurt him, and because he's so in love with me. Plus his whole family loves me, started calling themselves grandma, grandpa, aunt and uncle within the first few months of us being together. It will litterally devastate him.  My guess is he'll totally isolate himself and beginning questioning if life is even worth living... (He's told me about his past history with depression and suicidal thoughts.) I'm scared for him.
About 2 months I started to seriously consider leaving him, because I wanted to be my own person again. I want to be able to express my creativity and do crafts again. I just really don't want to hurt him, or for him to end up hurting himself somehow... He hasn't had suicidal thoughts in a long time but I know he'd take the break up so badly.. I don't know how to end things.


To top it off, over the past year, my mom has run into constant car trouble, and has borrowed just over $5,000 from Bobby. I myself owe Bobby almost $1500 at the moment. Both my mom and I are on government assistance of some sort, and live month to month, we don't exactly have a lot of  money.


I'm the type of person that hates being in dept, my mom was always horrible with her money and I've experienced what it's like to be dirt poor before. I hate that she owes him so much money, and I hate that I owe him so much money. I feel like I couldn't leave until that was paid off. I know money shouldn't be a part of it, but I can't take the stress of knowing my mother and I owe him so much. He's lent her money for 2 new vechicals, and every time there's car trouble, Bobby lends her more money. My mother and I both rely on her vechical for everything, we'd be screwed without it. I feel like it would be completely wrong for me to leave and owe him that much. I don't want it to be like that. I don't want to be 'that chick that used him for his money'.


And now this is where Joe comes into the picture again...


Once again I dreamt about Joe (current age 30), and getting back together with him, and it bugged me per usual, but didn't think anything else about it.
About 2 weeks later, I found a webpage on Joe's wife, saying she had left her husband and gotten into drinking constantly and doing drugs, and was sleeping with anyone who was willing. Thought about it a bit but didn't think anything more of it. I figured it was just roumours because she could be kind of a bitch.


Skip forward a month, 2 weeks ago now, and I go to where he works, (fast food place,) with Bobby for supper. My cousin and a family friend also work there. Joe was working, which was fine, nothing that hasn't happened before, but for the last 6 years he's just ignored me, put his head down whenever I seen him. This time, when he seen me, he looked surprised, and he actually said ""Oh~ Hi."" It honestly caught me so off gaurd, I felt my heart start to race a bit. I thought he looked a little stressed out though, and a little skinnier than I remembered.


I couldn't stop thinking about him for days, and when I was talking to my brother I mentioned that Joe actually said hi, and he confirmed what I read on the webpage. Joe is single again, and actually said hi to me.  It's been 2 weeks and I've thought about him more than I'd care to admit.


Realistically, Joe and I aren't going to happen... But the fact I've been thinking about Joe this much has really made me realize that I need to leave Bobby. He's not right for me in that way, I'm not happy in the relationship. We have good times, and we care about each other, but we don't mix. I feel like I need to be myself again... And it's not fair to Bobby that I spend all my time thinking about the possibilitys with someone else...


I feel so stuck between a rock and a hard place it's like any breath could be my last...




Reddit, what would you do in this situation?  What's the next step because I'm lost.

TL;DR: I've been thinking about my first real love constantly and it's been the final sign that I need to leave my current boyfriend, but emotional stress and money situations make it a really difficult thing to do.

Around one week ago she told me she doesn't want to be with me anymore. It wasn't entirely out of the blue because we've been arguing quite a lot recently, but we've always been able to talk things over and I was totally under the impression that she felt like me and felt like things were worth trying to save. Nothing serious ever happened, there were just lots of little things which just sort of built up and now she's telling me she can't go on anymore. 

I understand that I have to respect her decision and accept it even if it absolutely destroys me, but I have no idea what to do or where to go (other than here) because literally every aspect of my life revolved around her or involved her. I only live in this city and country because of her, in fact I only live in this area of the city because it's near her, we actually lived together for one year and planned on moving back in in February, I lost contact with all of my friends who are 1500 miles away in my hometown anyway, and I speak to my family regularly but we don't really have the kind of relationship where I can break down in front of them about this kind of thing. I have no friends here who weren't her friends first other than work colleagues, and even my dog is back home right now and I honestly think having her here would make me feel so much better as crazy as that sounds. All of my hobbies and interests were/are shared with her, and everything and everywhere I go reminds me of her. I would finish work and go to her house, we practically lived together anyway. I open up my ipod and the wallpaper is her photo, same on my phone and both of my computers. All of my plans for the future were shared with her, including 3 vacations together. 

Maybe I'm just showing how immature I am, but I feel so unbelievably alone right now and I don't have anyone I can talk to. I've spent the past week either at work or crying alone at home, and with the Christmas period coming up too which we were going to spend together because I can't actually get time off work to go home, I'm not sure how to deal with this. I just feel horrible and I would love to speak to someone or get some advice.

So thanks so much guys and have a nice day.

132430,Relationships,2r1tp1,"Hi.

I'm a 24 year old who's dating a rather charming 21 year old man. We've been dating for three months and two weeks ago he kissed some other guy while he was out with some of his friends. He says he was drunk and high.

To give some information about myself, I'm a fairly nerdy guy. I've been married before and unfortunately because I was cheated on there, that relationship ended. I also have Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, and while I don't really have any rituals that have become a habit, I've definitely felt the anxiety side of OCD my whole life.

Yesterday we were catching up from his drive back down from his home town on vacation of two weeks in Kansas City. I was very excited to see him again, he looked genuinely excited too. Something was off, but I didn't want to press it as anxiety has a really annoying way of making things seem like there's something's wrong with a situation when there really isn't.

Because I've been in a committed relationship, I seek stability. Financial stability? Eh - you don't have to be rich. Fidelity? Now that, yeah, I need that to be concrete. 

After we talked about how his trip was and spent some time together, I told him quite plainly: ""I like us. I like the way we operate and how open we are about things. I feel like right now I'm not getting everything that has happened. So if there is, please tell me.""

He admitted to kissing some dude, and I asked why he chose to hide it from me. He said ""I was afraid you would be upset, and I didn't know how to say it."" I felt like I was lied to because, while I'm a patient man, if I've been wronged I want to know immediately. I don't like things being hidden from me - especially if I should know.  I told him I was willing to forgive him and to move forward, but only if he knew that he wanted to be **committed, monogamous and honest.** (he said that he wanted all three)  I stated that I will not tolerate this sort of action again in the future, and stressed how this sort of act can really make it fucking hell with someone who has anxiety. He said he understood and gave me his word that it wouldn't happen again. 

Up until this point I felt like I could really trust the guy. Part of me feels like I still do. In a few days he's going with his family to some cruise in Miami, and I'm trying very hard to not be obsessive, possessive, jealous or angry. I am in love with this dude, but I've realized that knee-jerk reactions that are as hot as fire do not work with him. He has a poor tendency to get defensive when people are hurt from him, and that's the reason why I did not resort to lashing out/cussing at him/breaking shit; It'll yield nothing with his personality type. So that leaves me to be calm, collected and patient - but right now that's hard and I don't know what I can do to help. 

So please help. 


PS. are there other people there that could help me with a question? Do people really make mistakes? Is that a thing, or do I need to always have like one foot on the ground, ready to dash when someone makes a mistake?

We had been dating a year, we lost our virginity to each other and mean a great deal to each other.


We met up on Sunday and he was obviously confused, hurt, and scared. I want us to take a break, possibly get back together- but he denied my ideas over and over. Still he was checking me out, laughing with me/at my jokes, he held me, he wanted me to hold him, he kissed me, told me he loved me,and cried over our break-up a lot. Like a lot, I was scared.


Last minute, before he caught his ride home, I made it obvious what he was giving up VS. what he could have. He was holding me and wouldn't let go....until he started sobbing and shaking. Seriously freaked me out. Then I asked him if he was certain, if he was sure it was time to end this and he wanted to break-up, that we had no more value and that it was time to just give up. Then I pleaded, please say no. And he did, he exclaimed no and said I love you and kissed me and told me I could come visit him this weekend.


I love him so much, and I know that it isn't time to break-up. I can feel it, I am 100% that we haven't reached the end of our journey together.

26407,Dating,2i6r2e,"I just transferred to a new University and I've met a really cool guy there, just a few weeks ago. He's an older student going back to school to finish his degree. We met at a small get-to-know you meeting for our building, and I didn't guess his age at first. We began hanging out more often, having really great conversations and just generally enjoying each other's company. I, at some point learned his age, and though I was taken aback, I ignored it. I didn't mind being friends with someone older.

Over the weeks we began to get closer and he eventually expressed attraction to me. I was/am attracted to him as well and somewhat reciprocated, but expressed my doubts as to the age difference. This happened over the weekend and since then I haven't pulled away but things haven't progressed either.

Here's the thing. I don't feel like we're on particularly different levels of maturity. We seem to be on roughly similar levels of emotional maturity, and we're pretty much at the same stage in life. I guess he's young or immature for his age, so that's not really the problem. And of course, we are both consenting adults.

I just feel unaccountably uncomfortable with the age difference, and I'm not sure if it's justified. I hate the idea of having to introduce my 32 year old boyfriend, and it just weirds me out that when he was my age I was in the third grade. Plus, no matter how much I enjoy hanging out with him, I'm having trouble shaking the idea that there is something wrong with men that pursue much younger women. So reddit, am I justified here? Or should I try to move past it and give him a chance?

8145,Infidelity,2hzvj0,"Good morning everyone. My best friend (Male 26, call him James) has been dating this girl (call her Lani) for 3 years now. Lani had a reputation as kind of a party girl, and it worried me for a long time. My brothers girlfriend and Lani have been working on and off together for the past few months. James is in an academy for Police training and living two hours away and home on the weekends.


James has bought this girl a car, moved her in with him, helped her start her own business, and a plethora of other things. Lani confided in my brothers girlfriend (Chris we'll call her), that she has been cheating on James with this guy she met at a bar. When Chris question Lani on the subject, she responds with But if I stay with James I'll be set, or But I really like this guy, and wants to let it go for a few years before she confesses anything to James. Just last night she snuck out the window to not alert anyone else in the house she left to see this other guy.


James and I have been best friends for over 20 years, I know he would want to know. My only concern is for Chris who is really now off-put by Lani, having Lani backlash because Chris is the only one who knows. But James is to good of person to be stuck in this situation, and before he proposes or she gets pregnant, I feel like it's my duty as his best friend to let him know...

20551,Infidelity,3di8r0,"I posted on breakup 3 weeks ago after breaking up with my girlfriend (who I will call Beta) of 8 months after Beta chose to disrespect me and leave me at her house while she went clubbing one night and partying the other night without ever thinking to introduce me to her friends. The day following the breakup I learned that she cheated on me with a coworker (Charlie) at the party and that she has been planning to break up with me for a while to get with Charlie.

Following those events and breakup, I felt miserable but moved on and dated two girls as rebound which I am not proud of. Also I confided in a couple of close friends and I disclosed secrets about Beta of which I promised Beta I would never tell. Beta keeps texting me that she still missed me and needed to talk to me about her thoughts and mental issues because I was her rock during the relationship. Charlie never offered that comfort but she still kept going to his place and fucking him late at night for a week straight (information that she told me). Eventually she knew she was being used and played but still keeps going back.

During one text conversation, I told her I'm only willing to be friends with benefits with her because she said she is still attracted to me. And so one weekend we went to party at our college and it was the first time we met up after 2 weeks of break up. I'll spare the details of what we did but she told me she still wanted to get together and date again and that she made a horrible mistake and missed our great sex. And I being the schmuck I am took her back against the warnings and wishes of ALL my friends and family. Every night of the weekend we fought and argued and I keep unintentionally make her feel extremely guilty. After the weekend of partying, I left for my hometown.

So we communicated through text and skype and during one skype call where I try to find some closure, she asked if I told anybody her secrets and after mutiple denials and feelings of guilt I confessed and said I told my parents and two closest friends (who she hates because they hated her for cheating). She went ballistic on me and told me how betrayed she felt that the only person she trusted with the secrets would disclose the information to others. I felt so ashamed and she also argued how I made her seem like she was the one that fucked up majorly when I also fucked up. I agree that I did fuck up because I told the secrets as a way of being spiteful and petty because I was so outraged when I learned of the infidelity.

Now there is a couple issues I am confused over:
1. My friends are always bashing Beta and she gets mad at me for not standing up for her even though she was the one that cheated and I don't know how to defend her on that. And then she plays the card where I also fucked up (her close friends hate me too apparently because of the secret-telling) so my friends have no right to judge her.

2. I don't trust her and she doesn't trust me. We both want to rebuild that but I am always feeling sick to my stomach and the cheating always creeps up into my mind.

3. I can't stop thinking once a cheater always a cheater even though Beta seems regretful and remorseful over what she did.

4. I loved her before the infidelity and that feeling never really went away. But she is controlling and not letting me go party with my friends because they don't like her. Also she gets paranoid and went ballistic again on a female friend that texts me often, telling the friend to fuck off and stop trying to steal me away.

5. She has quite a bit of mental issues that are incredibly exhausting to deal with and possibility contributed to her lack of impulse control (which led to the cheating???).

6. She told me she needed to be smothered in affection and I didn't give her enough, which was why she went after the coworker to seek validation and show me that she is desired and beautiful (funny though because I was heads over heels for her during the entirety of the relationship and her excuse seems inconsistent with her actions because she was going to dump me for Charlie).

Overall there are just so many challenges and I don't know if I am still with her because I am afraid of loneliness, I miss the great sex, I pity her for her past (the secrets), I genuinely love her, hero complex, or other various reasons. She and I really want this to work but it's just so tainted and I am still hurting and insecure over the infidelity and everybody is against the relationship but I can't bring myself to end it. I just want some clarity because my mind right now is a jumbled mess and I don't know what to do. I don't even know the right questions to ask anymore and I'm hoping you guys can do me a favor and offer some third-party perspective and what you would do in this situation. And sorry if this post is a mess because it reflects what my mind is right now... and there may be some details I missed because so much has happened.

We have been living together for a year and things have been getting slowly worse. We bicker a lot.  I guess I have one of those ""bitch faces"" as he says and something as simple as me asking him, ""Hey, John*, can you please do the dishes?"" will make him take it personally and flips a switch. When he gets angry, he will call me a ""stupid fucking bitch"" a ""dumb cunt,"" etc.  I don't think he realizes how much his words hurt.  (""They're just words, and you were being a cunt"")

However one of the biggest sources of pain for me in our relationship is the sex and intimacy.  He only hugs me if I'm upset, and he never initiates sexy time.  He denies me all the time.  Furthermore, I feel like he has no interest in me.  We both work weird hours and I get to see him for about 2 hours in the morning and 2 hours before we go to bed.  He never seems excited to see me when he comes home, it's straight to his phone or computer.  On the rare occasion my attempts at seducing him are successful, I feel like these are the only times he's interested in me.  The only time he even looks at me like I'm worth something to him is when I'm sucking him off.

He doesn't even look me in the eyes anymore.  I try to ask him to lay with me, to look at me, to talk to me, and he's not interested. He'll just close his eyes and fall asleep.

Recently, I kind of had a mental breakdown about it all and told him I needed to get away - alone.  I took off of work for a weekend and spent 3 days in the forest backpacking a bit with my dog.  Meditating, walking, being at peace and appreciating the little things, cooking my food by a fire and appreciating the calm and quiet.  It was lovely.  I needed it.

When I came back, he had all sorts of accusations about how he know I went to cheat and I'm a ""worthless fucking whore.""  My attempts to hug him, kiss him, etc, are pushed away. It's been 2 weeks and he still won't acknowledge me, kiss me, etc.  He started complaining about my cooking and will often feed it to the dog in front of me and order out for himself. He says he can't believe a word I say, etc.

I've tried to talk to him like an adult, suggest couples counseling, etc, and he refuses.  When I mention breaking up and moving out he says it just ""shows him that I've moved on and probably cheated because I don't want to fix what I've done.""

I really don't know what I've done.  All of this behavior is so recent, the past 3 years has been wonderful and things have only begun to go bad in the past 6 months or so.  I love him and am really running out of ideas on how to make him look at me the way he used to.

He would always Text me, telling me how wonderful I am, that he will be there for me no matter what, that I'm pretty and beautiful and the most amazing person he has ever met. Last week we had a long talk because I felt like opening up to him because I trust him that much. So while we were talking I told him I dislike my life (different Story for a different time WHY I feel like that a lot of the times). As soon as I said this he went crazy. How can I say this and I should feel guilty about insulting something he loves (my life) and how I am childish and stupid and I should be happy to live in a country where I am a privileged person etc. I told him I'm sorry for saying this and that I didn't mean it and will never say that again. 

(also he insulted me in the first and when I said I don't want to see him he made me feel like I was super crazy and acting out) 

After this fight he wouldn't Text that often anymore, even tho I told him I miss him and wish he would Text me more often. The only times he still would Text me that often was, when he wanted to have sexy pictures of me. He would get mad at me for asking if I did something wrong and always making me feel very guilty for thinking that. 
2 days ago I travelled about 17 hours to see him for not even a whole day, just to be close to him. We had a wonderful time, even tho when we were outside he wouldn't hold my Hand all the time (probably that's just something 32 year olds don't do that much?) or kiss me that much in public.. We also had sex. 

Now that I'm back home I was worried because he didn't Text me back for about 10 hours and I thought maybe he doesn't like me anymore. So I asked him and it resulted in him making me feel like a piece of shit because I could think such Bad things and I hurt him so much with that. 

Today I wanted to apologize but he didn't want an apology. He told me he now got rashes on his Penis and it has to be my fault because I'm the only one he has had sex with. I told him it cannot be me (hadn't had sex in a while)  and how he could think that. So I asked him to return the stuff (important for me) I forgot a this place per Mail. 
Now he's making me feel like I'm crazy for wanting him to send it because ""why should he do that je can just come visit me"" like nothing ever happened.

46656,Relationships,1xnd3m,"We've been together since we were 16. Married since 23/24 (approximately 1 and 1/2 years of marriage). We don't have kids, just dogs and cats.

The last year has been really hard on us primarily because of my husband's addiction issues and everything that stemmed from them. He's an alcoholic, with a history of other (minor?) substance abuse (i.e. abusing Vicodin for a while, Adderall, pot a *long* time ago). The alcoholism has been the primary issue, along with the lying that went with it. We've been attending couples' counseling since the summer of 2013.

His habit of lying and hiding things led to me having major anxiety about his whereabouts and becoming controlling in an effort to keep him from hurting himself or others. As an example, we have one vehicle (given to me by my family before our marriage, so it's mine from that standpoint)- I found out several months after the fact that he received a citation for driving with an open intoxicant in the vehicle. I told him he wasn't allowed to drive my vehicle anymore.  

A few months ago he agreed to go into a treatment program in order to help him learn how to deal with his addictions. Since his graduation from the program, he has largely remained sober, which is fantastic. He has also grown very distant from me. We've had opposite work schedules for the past 6 months, meaning we get to see each other for about an hour every day (when he gets home at night, right before I go to bed).  

Besides all this, we've never had superb communication with each other; he comes from a family of high-functioning addicts who don't communicate with each other (i.e. his mom recently had a fairly major surgery... We found out via text message, the morning of the operation, through his sister). I come from a family who is very open, so I'm very big into sharing- to a fault.

Since the treatment program, he has told me various things such as I don't know who I am anymore (basically, he has no idea who he is as a sober person, since he has been so sick for so long), I don't feel the same about you anymore, You don't understand what this is like, and so forth. This has led to great confusion from my point of view, because he hasn't been open about his healing process to me at all. It's almost impossible for me to understand, since he generally just doesn't try and explain it to me.  

This all basically came to a head last night when he came home from work (in reality, he's been lying to me about working a night shift on Monday, and was spending time with a coworker of his). He told me he doesn't think our relationship is salvageable. That, for the first time, he can't positively see a future with me anymore. That he doesn't know who he is outside the context of our relationship.  

I begged him to give us a chance to fix it- from my standpoint, it's impossible to feel close to someone you only see/talk to for an hour each day. We feel more like roommates than spouses at this point. However, he says the lack of time together hasn't bothered him, and that he doesn't see it as an issue the way I do. I asked him for time to work on things- he said he *has* been working on things. He said that he wants to move out for a while, and he only sees it going two ways- either he'll miss me, and realize he wants to be with me... Or he'll be okay without me, and move on.  

I just feel so lost. He's been doing so much to better himself, but it's all been either internalized, or not shared with me. I feel like I've been left out of everything, and he's just deciding that we're no longer functional without even trying to work *with* me on our issues. I have by no means been the perfect wife, but I've made an effort to stay with him through a lot of truly difficult and horrible shit (deaths in the family, addiction, legal issues, etc) because I love him tremendously and I believed he could get better and become sober and (eventually) happy if we worked on it hard enough.  

But now it seems like there isn't a place for me in his sobriety. I don't know what to do, or how to talk to him about this. Or even what I *should* talk to him about.

I'm going to try to break this down into a concrete solicitation of advice, but as things get bleaker and more unmanageable every single day, anything helps: affirmation, constructive criticism, funny GIFs. 

My family is all kinds of dysfunctional. My dad's not in the picture and hasn't been for years. We're not financially stable. My mom was just diagnosed with an aggressive cancer, so I moved back home to help take care of her. And that means exposing myself, once again, to my sister's abuse and my mom's tolerance of it. And that's where our story starts. 

For years, it was just the three of us -- me, my sister, and my mom. My mom was out of the house a lot, working two jobs. My sister and I stayed home together after school. It took a really long time for me to come to terms with the fact that what I had always considered to be run-of-the-mill fighting with my sister was actually abuse. 

My sister's bigger and stronger than me. We'd get into it pretty much every day after school. For years, I thought that when she hit me, or punched me, or dragged me across the floor by my hair, it was my fault -- for giving her attitude, for talking back. My mom would punish both of us whenever I told her my sister had hit me, so I learned to stop telling her. I had to live by a really complex set of rules when I was younger, all of them put in place because my sister would throw tantrums and my mom would give in to keep the peace. I wasn't allowed to sing. I wasn't allowed to play music, or practice piano. I wasn't allowed to watch TV above a certain volume. I wasn't allowed to use my sister's bathroom, or touch her things, or enter her room. 

My mom giving in to keep the peace has continued up until the present day -- and that means regularly telling me to back off, or to stop provoking her. We all have learned to navigate my sister's tantrums and her abuse -- not to walk too loudly in the house, not to cook things she doesn't like, not to turn the TV up past 27 or borrow her things or use her bathroom. But it sometimes feels like a game of minesweeper. 

As I got older, the abuse changed. My sister couldn't tackle me to the floor anymore, or lock me in the closet. Whenever we'd fight, she'd pretend she was about to hit me, and laugh when I'd flinch. Or she would walk into my room and break something. Sometimes, she'd slap me, or wait until my back was turned and kick me. I'm still working through how easily I get startled, or how much loud noises unsettle me, but I think I'd been doing pretty well with all of this until now. 

I've tried to confront her, and my mother, about the abuse. It got so bad once that I had to check into a hotel after my sister broke my phone when I told her I was scared and that if she continued to threaten me, I'd call the police. But my sister's answer is that I'm emotionally abusive, and that gives her the right to be physically abusive -- that the same way I use my words, she can use her hands. I've done a lot of soul-searching about whether the first part is true -- and I don't think it is -- but I don't think that anything anyone says to you, EVER, is a reason to physically abuse them for years. 

My mom sometimes parrots my sister's defense back to me, saying that I provoke my sister. But because my mom's health has been deteriorating for a while, she often begs me to just take it -- and to work hard to help my sister, professionally, to get into graduate school, saying that if I love her, I'll work harder to get along with my sister and help her. I know that's manipulative. But I really love my mom. I consider her my best friend and I don't want to disappoint her, so I work hard and do the best that I can. I've spent weeks helping my sister apply to jobs and graduate schools. During that time, I know that my sister knew my mother would yell at me if I didn't help her complete these applications, and that as a result, she would often do a crappy job, knowing that I would rewrite them to avoid fighting with her. 

Finally, though, I had to put my foot down. My sister still lives at home, and I like coming home for the holidays. But when I returned to my hometown for graduate school three years ago, I rented a room near school. I told my mom that my sister and I clearly can't co-exist, and that the best thing for all of us is for me to live somewhere else for the time being. 

But this year, two things changed. First, my sister attempted suicide over the summer. I'm relieved she didn't go through with it, and I think she's finally getting the help she needs. She's seeing a therapist and on medication.

Second, my mother was diagnosed with cancer. I spent weeks in the hospital with her, in and out of emergency rooms, while juggling two jobs and my classes, because my sister doesn't like hospitals. I finally moved back home to help with my mom's day-to-day care, and that's where I am right now. I don't mean to be unfair to my sister -- this is unmanageable for one person. It takes an entire support system to coordinate someone's care. 

My mom's illness is taking a huge toll on all of us -- but my mom most of all. She's irritable, depressed, paralyzed, and in constant pain. Every day is a struggle. But I could deal with that. What I can't deal with is living with my sister. 

We fight every day. There is literally nothing I can do to avoid fighting with her, and trust me, I don't usually start these fights and I don't defend myself -- she just comes into the room and starts yelling at me. If I tell her off -- once when she started driving dangerously, telling her off for being fucking crazy -- she'll call my mom each time, or call my mom and lie, telling my mom that I told her to go kill herself, and creating another fight, now between me and mom. 

We agreed to split up the week between us so that we each get days off. I'm a full-time student juggling two part-time jobs. She's unemployed and spends her days off sleeping or going to the gym. So on my days off, I study and go to work; on her days off, she goes out. But almost every week, she'll tell me she just doesn't feel up to it one day, and suddenly that day will be my responsibility. She yells at my mom if my mom complains or says she's in pain. She's deeply unpleasant to be around, and I honestly believe that she uses her depression as a way of avoiding responsibility. My mom's car broke down, and she won't even help me get to the library or drop me off or share our family's second car -- I've been walking around suburbia in the rain and studying in a local pizzeria. 

So we're at an impasse. I can't confront her about how shitty she's being, because any time I even get close to confronting her, she starts talking about how bad I'm making her feel and about how this makes her want to kill herself. I can't expect my mom to mediate, because she rightfully points out that she's in no condition to be the peacemaker when she's fighting for her life. I can't leave, because I know my mom needs my help and needs me here. But I can't stay, because each day that passes, I can feel myself becoming more and more depressed and unhappy and worn down, and I don't know how to make this better.

******** Backstory of what lead to the situation ********

I had been best friends with Danielle (22F) since middle school. I spent pretty much every day at her house and her family was basically a second family to me. I attended family-only events with them (this includes extended family like aunts and uncles). Her grandma makes cakes and happily agreed to make my future wedding cake (this becomes relevant later).

After high school, I went off to do my own thing a few states away, as these things go, but still attempted to maintain a friendship with Danielle. She also did her own thing so she seldom answered, as she was busy. Which is fine.

During that time, I became closer to my first friend from middle school Tina (we've always been really close, but not 'best friend' status). We talked every day (and still do).

While out of my home state, I got engaged to my boyfriend (27/M) of 5 years. Naturally, Tina was made Maid of Honor and Danielle was a bridesmaid. This hurt Danielle tremendously, as she later told me.

Time goes on. I get a better job back in my home state and move back. For the wedding, one of my friend's moms makes clothing and we hired her to make the bridesmaids dresses. I attempt to wrangle my wedding party to go get their measurements done by her (she specifically requested to do them herself and the material is really difficult to tailor if the measurements aren't spot on). No biggie. 1 of the bridal party is out of state so hers are gonna get done at a later time when she visited. I ask the remaining 4 what day works for them. Tina suggests a date two weeks out. The other two ladies agree with the date but we hear nothing from Danielle**. (This is done via a Facebook group). No biggie. It's still two weeks out. I send Danielle** a text a couple nights later about it and hear nothing. I periodically sent a few more messages over the course of the week and a half and finally get an answer the day before asking if we can move it earlier in the day. A bit late to ask, and the dressmakers schedule is full, but I ask if she could meet Danielle early. She agrees to meet Danielle earlier. I relay this and hear nothing. The day comes and the time passes that she asked for and I still hear nothing. I hear from her 15 minutes before the time that everyone else agreed to saying she can't make it. 

This was basically the final straw. There had been several instances before where she had been unreachable. So I meet up with her for lunch a few weeks later (after trying for a long while to get a hold of her. I eventually sent We need to talk, urgently message and that got through)

Basically I flat out ask her if her schedule is too hectic to be a part of this. I don't set dates for the party, I let them work around their own schedules and come to a consensus on their own. But the other party members are super frustrated with her not participating with the date discussions and then saying the day before that she can't make it. The dress measurements were pretty much the only thing that she'd have to do (minus the rehearsal dinner and wedding itself. Which the other members started asking if she was going to try to reschedule that...)

She counters with asking if I only asked her to be a bridesmaid out of obligation since we were so close for so long, since our friendship really hadn't survived the test of time and distance.


***** End backstory *****

Long story short, we amicably (or so I thought) agree that it's really best for her to leave the wedding party.

A few months later, everything seems normal between me and her family, I'm wanting to get the cake taken care of so I ask Danielle for her grandmother's number to start talking about the cake. I hear nothing for a few weeks so I ask again. A few days later, I get a response that basically while things are okay with us and while she understands everything, and this all being nobody's fault, her family is uncomfortable with what went down so they're not going to the wedding. 

This completely destroys me. All of those years of being close to her family have gone up in smoke. Now let me say this, I completely understand. Of course they are going to side with their daughter in a fight that I had no idea was happening. I understand that this whole thing is all my fault.

I'm also confused because I visited them on Christmas (not too long before she told me this) and asked if I could deliver all the wedding invitations to her mom and she would distribute them out as she had with the save the date cards. She said sure! and everything seemed completely normal. Which I find odd if they decided not to go, because this all went down long before Christmas. Had Danielle really waited so long to tell them? Or had they just put on a front for me and played pretend? Her mom still likes things on my Facebook, which doesn't seem like behavior of someone who doesn't want anything to do with you anymore. 

I haven't spoken to the family since Danielle told me this, and wanted to just let it go, but I keep getting nightmares  being at their house and trying to resolve things. Not like saying Here's why this happened and why it's not my fault but This happened and I understand and respect your decision to not attend, but I wanted to just clear the air. Only to have them yell at me and tell me to leave, saying I'm no longer a part of this family and so on. 

So I guess my question is what do I do? Do I just consider this a lost cause? Or do I go talk to her parents? What do I say? I don't want to try and justify what happened but if I talk to them and they ask, I don't know what to say. We both have our own sides of the story and from an outside perspective they're both right.

   
**tl;dr**: Old best friend's family was like a second family to me. After she and I agreed (or so I thought) for her to leave the wedding party, she tells me her family isn't going to go, despite me recently talking to them and everything seemed fine. Understand the family would obviously take her side (despite me thinking there were no sides) and respect that, but keep having nightmares about talking to them and having them yell at me. How to approach this? Leave it? Talk to them?

Long story, will summarize as best I can, thank you in advance.
A couple years ago, my girlfriend (Kate) at the time went through my phone and found a less than appropriate conversation with a friend of mine who was married (Crystal). She was unhappy in her marriage and I suppose I was feeling slightly neglected in my relationship at the time, I loved the girl like crazy but was physically not 100% happy due to some extenuating circumstances. (My boss broke his back, forcing me to commute to keep my job, gf at the time didn't understand how miserable that was, blah blah). 


She immediately broke it off, and I can't say I blame her as I was, in my opinion, emotionally cheating as I was having sexual conversations with the married friend. The weekend immediately following the breakup, Kate hangs out and makes out with her ex. Calls me crying, demanding we talk, and I drive to see her and we do... Hard to explain the dynamics of that conversation, but basically we agree to try and work things out and see what happens...


I give kate the time she asks for and check in occasionally, but the more time she spends with her friends, the more apparent it becomes that they are influencing her and eventually it becomes clear that we are done. I call her and say goodbye. Throughout our entire relationship, I'd been fighting to join the military and several days before the call, I get the green light.


A few months later, I send off to train, hoping the military would beat whatever feelings out of me, and I'd be a cold hearted, barrel chested freedom fighter. In reality there is a ton of down time and I still find myself thinking about her occasionally. I finish training, get to my permanent station and try to have normal relationships but can't. Run through a few craptastic relationships, finally land one who is pretty awesome. I still feel nothing toward her, weve been together nearly a year. She spoils me, it's very obvious that she loves me, and I care about her a great deal but I feel hollow, a friend decided they'd had enough and looked at kate's facebook, sure enough she's in a relationship. Fair enough as I am as well, but it crushed me to find that out and we haven't even spoken in more than 3 years.


Truth be told reddit, I feel hollow, lost, I don't get butterflies for anyone the way I did Kate, and I don't get excited about other people. It doesn't effect my work, I am pretty damn good at what I do and I generally enjoy it. I don't know what to do though, I'm slated to head to Germany this year. I can't make sense of myself, my emotions or what's going on... I'm sad for how I made her feel, I'm sad I don't have her, and I'm sad in general. I fucked up, and I feel like she was the one, and I was the fucking idiot who treated her poorly. I need help.

154972,Relationships,3h5nwo,"I know these always start out with talking the guy up and then comes the downward spiral but my fiancé honestly is one of the most caring people I've ever met towards me, his family, and friends. He's completely devoted to me and tells me all the time how I'm everything to him. At the same time he does have a really bad temper and controlling streak. He has gotten better at keeping all that in check but since I'm the closest person to him, I get to see him at his worst...and get blamed for it.

I'm a pretty laid back person and actually get told by people I know (coworkers, acquaintances) that I'm too nice. I had a bad relationship with my ex(not my fiancé) years ago where he physically and mentally tormented me for years and I always felt the need to figure out how to fix it until one day I finally snapped and realized I had to leave. I realized I couldn't ever have a child with him and subject them to such a volatile environment. Ever since then I stopped allowing people to walk all over me but still try not to be bitter because I didn't want him to ruin any future relationships I could potentially have.

Enough background story. I've now been with my fiancé for four years and while I don't feel he necessarily ""gets"" me (he doesn't get any kind of subtle humor and always tells me I'm weird or gets upset because he ""doesn't get it"" when I joke around with him) he does make sure to always be there for me and my family no matter what we go through. The problem is we argue a lot because he always tells me how he's in control and when I tell him he's not, we're in a relationship together he gets upset and keeps insisting he's ""in control"". He's more than two times my weight so he likes to play fight and put me in chokeholds as a joke...but I kind of feel it's more of a control thing than a meaningless game. He also likes to smoosh my face and since I hate it I tell him to stop. He ends up getting really angry and saying, ""but *I* like it"" and continues to do it. He does other controlling things like show up wherever I am unannounced to check on me, look over my shoulder when I'm on my phone while asking me to show him what other websites I have open or messages I was reading(I've never done a single thing to betray him but his ex did), and raises his voice over mine countless times every day. When he gets angry he yells and does this crazy growl thing with his voice and starts shaking like he's about to lose control of himself in order to intimidate me. He attempts to intimidate me all the time, even over the most minor things. It's like he's obsessed with finding things to get angry over and I'm always there with him so he finds ways to say it's my fault. I normally just try to get along and rarely start arguments but I have become so fed up with how controlling he is and how he tries to scare me that I almost always end up reacting by screaming back at him or leaving. I'm tired of the cycle. I hate it.

The recent problem: Last week, while we were out, we got into an argument and he went into his crazy-eyed intimidation shake while screaming at me. I was sick of being pushed around, lost it and punched him in the face. He shoved me really hard and I ended up falling in a way that I really injured myself. I haven't been able to walk all week since.

I feel like a horrible person for hitting him. He has tried to scare me and physically move me before in the past and I hit him at that time too. I've never hit anyone other than him....I guess I panic, feel desperate, overpowered and react. And in some weird way I think he tries to provoke me and likes when I hit him(he has a history of getting into fights with guys but not ex-girlfriends as far as I know). Even though no matter how much bigger than me he is, I should have never done it. This isn't who I am. This isn't what I do. Only with him. And this time he ended up hurting me to the point that I needed to go to the hospital.

Can someone with such anger/control issues learn to stop reacting the way he does so I don't feel so threatened? Has anyone been in a situation like this? We've been together so long and I've been dealing with his temper so long that I kind of have a hard time knowing when the line has been crossed. I pretty much hate myself and feel like the worst person alive for hitting him. I also feel helpless when he goes into a rage. I've spent almost all my time with him the last four years and our families get along really well so leaving him and starting over would be really hard even though I've done it before(in past relationships) and would do it again if it's best for both of us. I guess I just want somebody who can relate to being in a relationship like this to reply and let me know how they handled it.

 I'm quite at a loss for what's going on. For the past month or so my boyfriend has been acting distant and it's been making me unhappy to no ends. We've been together for about nine months an I'm his first relationship, due to his shy and quiet nature around new people. 


So I confronted him on Monday asking him what he wanted from our relationship and how the emotional distance he's portraying is taking it's toll on me and basically came up with these definitions to the way hes been acting. 


-he is going to be joining the army and he said lately he's been thinking about us and how he doesn't want me to end up resenting him when he's away all the time, that he will basically be holding me back. I told him that I support him and in no way will resent him for joining the army and doing what he wants with his life. As a girlfriend, I love him so much that I will be there for him. 

-than, he brought up the fact that this is his first relationship and that he doesn't want to sound like an asshole but he's afraid of all that experiences he will be missing out on, and he pointed out that I've had previous boyfriends and so I have experience with other people. Despite him saying that he said he loves me very much and he's not sure what he wants.


So I suggested he take a break of no communication from me for a week to think about what he truly wants and where I fit in. To salvage our relationship or not, and he actually messaged me last night saying he knows he's breaking the no communication rule but he wanted to tell me that he misses me like crazy and loves me very much, and it made me cry. 


But now as the week goes by I'm angry and hurt because at first I wanted the relationship to last but now I just feel like a last resort. I'm rendered as a second option because he doesn't know what he wants. He's rather give up a girl who loves every inch of him, who supports him, who loves being by his side, and in return I get none of that. Is it really love if someone puts a person like that on hold and be selfish to be with other people? Or is it me who's selfish in inhibiting his wants and needs for mine?  I'm so conflicted and angry. I break out in tears randomly and I need advice!

64563,Breakups,2rzn9f,"My girlfriend and I broke up almost a year ago. At the time we were both 16 and are now both 17 and in high school. For a few months after that she told me she didn't care for me and a whole lot of other things. I was desperate and I tried my hardest to get her back, but had no luck. I was distraught to say the least. Then one day I met another girl and I started to like her and show some interest. Somehow my ex found out and started talking to me again. Which led to me focusing a lot of my attention on her again. I was sucked back in and back at square one. 

This trend kept on happening up until a few months ago. I had made up my mind and said I was done with her and I was going to move on. Once again, she found out about this due to mutual friends. She wrote me a letter saying how she still loved me and would do anything to be with me again. I was foolish and agreed. We kind of dated for a week and I had to call it off because I was just so confused on how I felt. We remained fairly close, but argued a lot for the months to come. About a month ago she met a guy and has since started dating him. Before that though we were really close and I had even thought about trying again. I felt terrible. I tried to just cut ties, but since I see her almost everyday that wasn't very easy. Not too long ago we got close again, probably a few weeks back. Then the same thing happened.

28520,Relationships,1ovqe6,"For the last year or so, my girlfriend and I have had a pretty good routine. We text some during the day and always, ALWAYS text at night. Our conversations differ in length depending on how much homework we have or how tired we are, but we always talk a little bit and never go to sleep without saying goodnight and I love you to each other.


A couple of days ago, she and a couple friends of hers started an iMessage group conversation and invited me in. I like texting her friends (they're sort of friends of mine too), but the problem is that this is basically replacing our one-on-one conversations at night. 


I really like texting her and her friends, since it's a lot of fun, but I miss our private conversations. It's like hanging out with friends and your SO in person: fun, but you want to be alone sometimes. Our lack of private conversation is getting to me, too. In the last three days, I think we've sent maybe half a dozen texts between each other in our own texting conversation, and when I text her there, she'll maybe respond once or twice before carrying on just the group conversation. 


I don't want to make it seem like I want her to put me as more of a priority than her friends, since she's entitled to talk to them. At the same time, I don't want to seem like I don't want to talk to her friends, because I do. I just want to talk to her alone as well. I think she thinks this group conversation is enough for me and makes up for no private conversation between us, but it really doesn't. 


I don't think she's doing it intentionally, I think she just doesn't get how much I value our private conversations. They aren't really about anything personal or secretive, just stuff about our days and general conversation, but I'm a rather private person (voicing my relationship difficulties on the internet, ironically) and don't like other people hearing our conversation. 


The other thing that bugs me is that she usually texts me when she's getting ready for bed and we text until she goes to sleep. Now, she texts in this group conversation until she goes to bed and I'm lucky if I get so much as a goodnight baby! I love you!. 


Finally, she'll say that she's working on something, which I always take to mean that she wants me to leave her alone so she can focus, since that's what we've done in the past. We don't distract each other while we're working and talk when we're done. Now, she'll say she's going to work on something in the group, I'll say okay, I'll leave you alone so you can focus, and then she'll continue texting in the group conversation, without even telling me I can keep texting her because I'm not distracting her. 


This is all starting to really piss me off, because I feel like she's placing a lot more importance on this conversation with her friends than any interaction with me. I don't care if she wants to talk to her friends, but I feel like there's a double standard here. We won't text when she's trying to focus, but she's happy to text them. She'll talk to them until she's about to fall asleep and I'm lucky if I get any kind of special acknowledgement. I know I sound like I'm saying I'm more important than her other friends, and I kinda feel like I am. I'm her boyfriend, we've been together for a long time, and I don't think five minutes of private conversation is too much to ask for.

17693,Breakups,2q9ony,"I posted here a few weeks ago when we were still together and most of you said he was a douche and that I should dump him. I took your advice and i'm so glad I did.

We started dating almost five months ago and he was very sweet and caring. Though after I lost my virginity to him (2 months into dating), he gradually became rude and distant. We would still see each other every weekend but some of the things he said and the way he was acting bothered me. He would mention how crazy both his ex's were and he would judge people based on trivial things like their appearance, social status, car, etc. When we got into arguments, I was always the one to apologize because I for some reason thought everything was my fault. 

On our last date, he told me that he probably wouldn't sleep with anyone else and that you're only 18. let's not take this relationship so seriously. That just killed it for me. We avoided each other that entire week and I decided to send him a break up text since I didn't think he deserved an in-person break up. 

Here's how it went:

Me: Hey, so it really seems like we're fading each other out and it's pretty clear neither of us are feeling it anyway so i'm just going to go ahead and bounce. Hope you have a good break and good luck next semester

Him: So what have you been up to lately????

Me: I'm sorry, did you read my text? Because I feel like that wasn't a normal response to it.

Him: Yes I read it...I was just asking, how have you been?

Me: I'm fine. Are you okay?

Him: Yeah i'm at the gym. How did you do on your math final?

Me: Let's just say I hope we don't have the same math class next semester...

Him: Hahaha come on!!! So I guess that means you failed then huh? 


I didn't reply and then he texted me a few days later:

Him: Are you taking [professor's name] again??

Me: No, i'm taking [another professor's name]. She has better reviews

Him: Okay cool, I'll look her up

A few days later, I was still confused by his behavior and curious to where his mind was at so I texted him:

Me: Hey! Wanna be in the same class?

Him: Lol sure...I'll add that one you told me about

Me: Okay :). So could we go back to being just friends again?

It's been two days and he hasn't replied back. I honestly couldn't care less if we're friends or not, I just wanted him to tell me what he wants since he was being so confusing. I thought by his weirdly enthusiastic responses, the reply to my last text would be a positive one but I guess not. I don't even know why I wanted to end on good terms. I think part of me thought that I really was the immature and overly sensitive girl he painted me out to be therefore his rude behavior was justified...? I don't know but am I taking things too seriously like he's said? Because I know five months isn't a long time to be dating but it's long enough to take things more seriously than *that*. I feel pathetic for letting this bother me, I just can't understand why he would ignore me if he was being so normal before.


tl;dr: Broke up with douchebag boyfriend of five months over text. Didn't seem fazed by it and hinted at being in the same class next semester but when asked if he wanted to still be friends, he didn't reply. Did I do something wrong?

140561,Breakups,1l8fua,"So this is an extremely long story. I know it will get buried but I would appreciate it if someone read my story. It has gotten to the point where I am suffering too much. I need to vent. 

So where do I start? Me and my Ex girlfriend were together for 2 years. I did everything she wanted me to do and got her everything she's ever wanted. I went to the ends of the earth for this girl. We were happy together for a while but a lot has happened throughout our relationship that we can't repair it. I can count about 8 times she has cheated on me in some form or another (both romantically and physically in person and over the Internet) and our mutual friends told me to triple that number. I am devastated and I don't know what to do. 

When we first started dating she was everything to me. She was the sweetest girl. Didn't wear any makeup, was shy, and she genuinely cared about me. However, the red flags really popped up early in the relationship. 2 weeks into dating she told me she was going to a concert with an old guy friend. I wasn't worried about it and was down to let her go to the show. I trusted her. She eventually tells me that she isn't going to the concert and doesn't tell me why. 

A few months later she starts getting paranoid about who I am talking to, where I am going, etc and she starts becoming overbearing. I knew guys were talking to her, but it didn't matter to me because I trusted her. She proposes that we should exchange Facebook passwords since we have nothing to hide and I agreed and gave her my password and she gave me hers. I think this is where most of our problems started. 

I decide to look at her facebook one day because I had a gut feeling something was up. She had deleted every single message she had reviewed except for 3 recent ones from friends. I decide to check out the history on the guy who she was going to see the concert with. BEHOLD! They were flirting and talking about how they were going to kiss and potentially do other things. I find out the reason that she didn't go was because the guy who was taking her felt upset that she was dating me and felt dirty for making this girl cheat on me. I felt sick to my stomach. After many tears and apologies I forgive her and we stay together.

A couple of months later she started hanging out with a group of kids who didn't respect me. I felt upset because my girlfriend was hanging out with guys that don't like me. That was extremely fishy. She started going to these local concerts I always attend. She started telling me not to go to them because 'I would get beat up.' I did the forbidden act and checked her Facebook account. It turns out that there was nothing that I could see wrong. But I knew there was something she was doing. I felt it in my gut. I went to one of the shows I knew she was at handing our flyers for a show I was promoting and saw her at a table with a group of friends. She look like she saw a ghost. I wave at her and leave her alone. She later asks me for a ride home and I take her home. She seemed very distant and it bothered me a lot. But I just thought that she was just mad at me for being somewhere she didn't want me to be.

Closer to my high school graduation I went to a show and she told me not to get into the mosh pit since 'I owe her a pretty face for grad'. I knew that she was talking a lot with this guy named 'Bo'. And he was in the pit and seemed to be going after me. She was acting super distant from me at my grad and I later find out that her and Bo have been having sex the entire time. I was devastated. I cried myself to sleep for 2 weeks straight not knowing what to do.  She tells me that all she wants is me and she learnt from her mistake. What did I do? I bought it. I fucking believed her and put my faith in her again.

After all of that I decided to treat her the absolute best an 18 year old could do for a girl. I spent 6,000 on her that summer. I took her on weekend trips, paid for every date and bought her new clothes when she wanted something. It was a golden age for us. On our one year anniversary I gave her a promise ring and a bunch of gifts. She promised me that she would marry me one day. I cried out of pure joy. But that was short lived.

We broke up not when a month later. It turns out she was sending nudes to 7 different guys and was sleeping with another guy. I didn't even know what was going on. She hid it so well. During that time she told me 'Our relationship is perfect'.... Ugh. This is getting hard for me to type.

So when I found out she broke up with me. I caught her taking nudes of herself when I came over to her house to take back the ring, necklace, and other important things I gave her. I told her she disgusted me and I left. That night I decided to hang out with another girl and she posted about it on her Facebook. My ex sees this and loses her mind! She starts calling me and starts crying telling me that she wants me more than anything. The next week she was starting to have a thing with Bo again. At a show they were both there and i was furious and was moshing extremely hard. Bo starts a fight with me and I got gang beaten into a bloody pulp. I got kicked in the face and punched in the head numerous times. I tell her to fuck off and attempted to move on. For 2 weeks she harassed me and tried everything to get me back. It got to the point where she attempted to commit suicide to get me back. I was guilted and I got back together with her. I was bitter at the beginning when I got back together with her. But I felt better. Eventually I was completely normal with her and did everything for her.

Then 4 months later I go on a family vacation to the Bahamas. She decides to go on a 'break' and fuck one of my own friends. I start losing my mind at this point. When I got back from vacation we broke up and she left me for a guy she met on instagram. After that didnt work out she went back to trying to get me back. I kept resisting it and to this day she harasses me trying to get me back and guilting me. But then lying to everyone we know telling them I abused her and I did nothing for her. 

I am just destroyed. Nothing is worse than feeling completely unappreciated after going to the ends of the earth for a girl. I would have taken a bullet for her. I just need help to recover from the abuse I took. This whole post isn't even half the story. I could write a book with way more detail of what happened between me and her. I just need help. And I will appreciate any sort of advice. I just need to learn to cope and not give in to her again.

I had to move to my home-country (or at least where my family lives) because I'm a silly person and I didn't finish a few exams, they went wrong and now I would have to ''stay'' one year (it's actually 'at distance' studies, so I wouldn't HAVE to stay, but it would certainly help to study, as here I'm living with family with more space and support; and there I'm living with my gf, less friends would have to work to support myself, so I would have less time to study, etc...)

Now, we have been over a month and half away, and we are both losing our minds, fighting, getting back together, etc..., I feel that my ''attachment'' to the relationship is less strong, I have A LOT more things here going on that she does over there, so I'm less time talking and when we talk I'm not as focused and caring as I was when we lived together, etc... and so on and forth. Things are not easy right now. 

I know that ''the decision'' must come from inside, but I would certainly love to hear opinions.

168990,Dating,2tm728,"I'm a math professor. I spent 7 years in grad school and a postdoc in cities I absolutely loved, where I met lots of interesting people, and where cool stuff was going on all the time. I had a difficult time dating, mostly because I wasn't confident or socially savvy enough, but I met a lot of interesting people and at least put forth a good effort.

The job market in academia is extremely rough, and I was grateful to find a good job. The downside was that it was in an unexciting, somewhat economically depressed city, but I took the job and decided to make the most of it.

I'm in my fourth year here, and I still feel like a fish out of water. There is not much excitement here, and for the most part people don't value excitement. Most people whom I meet value routine, predictability, and agreeableness much more than I do. People like to talk a lot, but (more so than in other places I've lived) it is rude to bring up politics, controversial current events, or to ask questions like ""What do you do?"" In general, my sense of conversational etiquette is quite far off from local standards of politeness, and it's common for me to feel awkward as a result.

Indeed: I remember one OKCupid date (with a very interesting woman!) where I asked lots of questions about her hobbies and what she enjoyed doing. She seemed uncomfortable with it, and later told me (over OKC): ""I can't say that I really see those first few meetings as 'interview like', which is sort of what it sounded like you were looking for.""

Occasionally I do meet someone here who I really do find interesting and attractive. (For example I went to a folk music concert where the musicians were local and I had an instant crush on the bassist.) But usually I tend to flub things. I find dating awkward to begin with, and for the reasons I described above I've recently found it hard to act confident. And further complicating matters is the fact that my social life in general is not very active, for much the same reasons.

A further complication is.... I'm 36. I wish I was still 26, but -- well, I'm not. That's especially hard here, since most people in their thirties here are firmly entrenched into a predictable routine, and either like it that way or have apparently decided that they have no choice.

I'm quite active -- I regularly show up to aikido lessons, social dances, and yoga, and I was doing improv comedy lessons also until the one teacher in town quit. So, I already do meet a ton of people and I do find this fun.

Finally, one weird twist: it's been somewhat common here for women I meet to be romantically interested in me. In each case, I haven't been interested. I feel kind of bad for my disinterest, like I'm being too much of a snob! But, generally, I've felt that these are nice and interesting people who are nonetheless leading lives that don't seem especially interesting to me. Usually when I fall for somebody, it is because they bring out my good side -- their presence has done wonders for both my patience and my sense of adventure, and has made the world look both bigger and more accessible. I find it strange when women don't have the chance to see me as I the person I try to be, but are attracted to me anyway.

I don't have the option to move (at least not in the short term), so I am hoping for advice on how to make the best of my present situation. Thank you very much!

My friend, lets call him N, has been chasing this girl, S, for a long time (about 3 years). He confessed his feelings for her almost as long ago, but she did not reciprocate. They had a bit of a falling out, but reconciled about a month after said incident and have been friends ever since. All this time he would confide in me, and I would give him advice, try to find ways for him to win her over, and rooted for him the entire time.

Now fast forward to last year: Her landlords sold their house and she had to find a new place to love, or move back home with her mother (2-3 hours away). My friend asked me if I would consider renting her my basement since I have a decently sized house and I live alone. I agreed, and in August of last year, she finally moved in. For the first few months that she lived here we mainly kept to ourselves, aside from the occasional breakfast, and dooby session at night. She spent a lot of time with N, and would even spend the night at his house.

He told me everything about her, how he was falling for her, when he tried to make a move, and would chicken out, and how she was behaving. A literal play-by-play of their relationship, looking to me for advice.

Last summer he went away for an extended vacation, and that left me and S at home to hang out. Well we hung out a lot, she started opening up to me about her life, her family, we shared our interests, would start going out together to eat, or just kill time.

When my friend, N, finally came back from his vacation, she headed over immediately to his house and spent the next week at his house. I of course didn't think anything of it, after all, it was normal for her to stay there. Except... at this point I started liking her, but knowing my friend and his feelings for her, I ignored my brain and went on doing my shit.

The weeks that followed were weird. She wouldn't go over his house anymore, spent all her time with me, and as a result, we got even closer. Around New Year's he came over to my house and asked me if I was fucking her. I of course replied that I wasn't (which was absolutely true.. I did like her, but I never made a move on her). Then he proceeded to tell me that he was over her, and that he wasted too much of his time with her. 3 weeks after that, she and I were sitting at home on the couch, really close to each other, and I for some reason kissed her. She kissed me back, and then stopped herself, and said ""this is going to complicate things, and probably isn't a good idea"". I said that's fine, laughed about it, and carried on our usual business. There was no awkwardness, we both did what we did before. She actually made me pancakes for breakfast the day after... I never mentioned this to my friend, but I did feel like a scumbag for doing it.

Well fast forward to this March, 2 months have passed, we have gotten even closer, and she and my friend still see each other, albeit rarely (they do text though). Whenever he comes over to my house, he walks around every room like a fucking detective (probably looking for clues that we're fucking each other) and it makes me uncomfortable. She started working at a new job, and would hang out with me in the morning, go to work, come home and hang out with me more until she went to bed. I noticed this change in her and somehow allowed my emotions to take over, and realized that I may in fact, be in love with this girl after all.

Last week one of my female friends dropped in and told me that she has a date for me. When S heard her say that, her body language immediately went from warm to defensive. She wouldn't look me in the eye for the remainder of the morning. She went to work, and surprised the hell out of me when she came home for her lunch break (shes never done that before). Went back to work and when her shift was done, came home right after and hung out with me until like 4am and we had a great time. This continued all week long, she even started texting me when she had some free time to just chat me up.

When the day came for my 'date', she asked me if I'm going to be home when she comes for lunch. I told her that yes, I would be, and that I cancelled my date because I had to work late. She left the house with a smile on her face. When she came home for lunch, I surprised her with dinner (i hardly ever cook). She seemed to really enjoy it, told me about her job, and went back. When she came home, she looked like she was in a really good mood. We sat close to each other, and talked and fucked around on her computer until like 5am.

She ended up going back home for the weekend for a function and I found out from someone else, that she and my friend, hooked up (no sex) during the summer, and that he was sure that they were going to start dating when he came back from his vacation. Now I feel like I'm to blame for them not working out, and I feel even shitter knowing that something actually happened between them. I was under the assumption that nothing ever happened with them, and that they were just friends (he never told me anything happened, and this supposedly happened before she even moved in with me)

I don't know what to do now. I'm in love with the girl, and apparently so is he (even though hes mentioned on several times, not only to me, but other people, that hes over her), and she seems to like us both..

I feel like such a scumbag for falling for my friends 'crush'. The anxiety I'm experiencing right now is killing me. I tried to distance myself, but I can't do it, shes so good to me, and I see her all the time. But at the same time, I can't get these thoughts of them hooking up out of my head. I can't sleep, I can't eat, and my job performance is suffering because of it.

Do I tell her how I feel and try to see where we stand? Do i ask her what happened between her and my friend (or if there's something still going on?) I can't keep this up much longer, its consuming me... I need some kind of closure.. But I'm terrified of losing her. Please Reddit, give me some advice!

64530,Relationships,2x9ryf,"This is a throwaway, because I feel like an idiot for complaining about my boyfriend, who is usually just wonderful to me. He knows I've posted here before. I may be overreacting completely, and I would really love some unbiased advice. Thank you so, so much to anyone who reads all of this.

I want to start by saying my boyfriend, James, is extremely mature, very level-headed, and a true catch. If we ever have issues, he never lashes out, cusses, or calls me names. He talks calmly, tries to make valid points in order to express his opinions or why he feels the way he does. He never loses his temper, and he tries really hard not to say things that he might regret. For this, I am extremely appreciative to him. He's really a great person in almost every other way as well. He's really smart, funny, and we have a good time together. 

When we first met, it was like I met a male version of myself. We had everything in common, and it just felt so natural. Although, now I'm wondering if it only felt natural because I tried to be what he wanted. Of course, I don't think I did this intentionally. It just feels like we're different people now, and I'm wondering if I was different from who I thought I was. Or if we've just grown apart. 

Anyway, he occasionally says/does things that I just don't understand. But because he tries to think so logically during our arguments, he's incredibly stubborn and doesn't seem to understand a lot of things that bother me. I'll get down to the main points of concern. 

First of all, I'm about 5'5 and my weight typically cycles from 120-130. When we first met, I was probably about 10 pounds lighter. He lets me know how attractive he thought I was back then. I'm still in really good shape, and I do cardio for an hour every day. (I haven't been in a week because I've been really sick.) But he never does cardio, but he lifts weights occasionally and generally tries to eat healthy. I think he thinks it's a compliment when he talks about how I used to be tiny and I had a bridge. He lets me know that he loves petite girls, which I'm not any more. But he makes passive comments that really bug me. Like, if we're out eating, he'll casually mention that I should stop eating if I'm full... even when I'm not full. And one time, I was telling a story in front of our friends about how this girl from my office kept talking about how petite and tiny I was. To be honest, it was flattering, and I was just telling the story because I thought it was funny. James's reaction was to say in a surprised voice, WHAT? Was she obese or something?? In front of our friends. One of our friends who was there, by the way, says I have no curves except for my ear lobes and my shoulders. So yea... I think most people think I'm relatively small, but he doesn't. And he lets me know. 

I've talked to him about this, but it seems to get no where. I honestly don't know what to do any more. I know he likes girls to be smaller than where I am currently, but I flip-flop between feeling happy with my body and desperately wishing I was skinnier. He tells me he thinks I'm skinny, but it's SO obvious he's just saying that. Especially because, aside from when I tell him how he makes me feel, he never does/says anything to make me think he likes my body. I mean, I can't make him like my body, and I can't make him change his preferences, but I feel like even if he stops making these comments about my body, he'll just think them instead. It's not a big deal, but everyone wants to know that their partner finds them attractive, right?

Also, I've never been happier with regards to our social interactions with our friends. We have all the same friends, which is wonderful, and this makes it a lot easier for us to hang out together or invite people over. This however, has caused problems recently. The first and least troubling would be that I now have turned to Reddit for advice because I don't want our friends to think negatively about him or myself due to our relationship issues. I digress. Anyway, he has a female work friend, who I, admittedly, may have been reluctant to meet at first. And I really tried to get to know her and get comfortable with her as a person when I did meet her. When I met her, I was talking to her one-on-one about my new job and telling her something I thought would be exciting to talk about. In the middle of me talking, she turned to someone else and started talking to them. I was a little surprised, because that doesn't normally happen, at least in my experience. When she was done saying something, she turned back to me and said What were you saying? I just said Nevermind and forgot about it. She then continued to talk with other people. I figured maybe it was something she really just wanted to say, and I thought maybe what I was saying wouldn't have been interesting anyway. Then we saw her again at the company holiday party, and I was standing next to her in a circle of people. As I was in the middle of saying something to everyone, she just turned and started talking to someone else who nobody in the circle really knew, and pretty much just left. We also hung out at a bar once for her husband's work event, and she behaved the exact same way. I told James that I feel like she might be socially awkward, he pretty much just said he thought it was all in my head and she probably didn't mean it that way. I thought okay, that might be true. But later, I made some comment about how I typically get along with everyone, and he said, Well, no you don't like FemaleCoworker. I don't know why, but that just really bothered me. Like, I said she acted strange to me, but that doesn't mean I don't like her. And what if she doesn't like me? And on top of that, it was a little insulting that he would use that example in order to argue against the idea that I get along with people. This issue was probably the least of my concerns with regards to this topic.

Another strange thing that happened: We usually go out to this bar every Tuesday with a group of friends. One week, James started inviting people and asked me if I wanted to come. I said I did, but I couldn't afford to because I paid extra money to my student loan that month. He offered to pay for me because he really wanted me to come, so I accepted. We usually pay for ourselves every time we go out, so this was unusual for us. Well, a friend named Dylan noticed this one week, made a comment about it, and we just said we pay for ourselves. He has since tried to implement that with his girlfriend, Alysa, who doesn't really make that much money because she's still in school. Dylan has a full time job making more than I do. Anyway, when we went out this Tuesday, another friend told me to put my card down when it was time to pay. I just said that James said he would pay for me. Dylan made a HUGE deal about this, saying James, you're paying her student loan for her, you know that, right?! and he started chanting Go dutch! Go dutch! Go dutch! I felt like he was doing that because he didn't want Alysa to think that he should pay for her when they go out. Which really bothered me, because just a few minutes before this, I heard Dylan asking Alysa to pay for him, which Alysa refused because she barely has any money as it is. I explained to them that I wasn't going to come out originally, but James offered to pay for me because he wanted me to come. It still made me feel really uncomfortable that Dylan did that though. I told James how this made me feel, and he thinks that's all in my head too. He didn't stand up for me or make it clear that he wanted to pay for me, or anything like that. I told him that really bothered me, and he apologized that it bothered me, but he still said he didn't think Dylan had the intentions that I felt he had. 

I guess the main point of this is that I feel like for the most part, we share all the same friends. But I feel like he's not my partner in social situations that make me feel uncomfortable. I talked to him about this too. I guess he just sees no evidence that these things are happening, so the most logical answer for him, is to assume that I'm overreacting or making things up in my head. I mean, this might be true, but if that were the case, then it doesn't explain why I've gotten along so well with every other mutual friend we've had. These are just the two main events that have caused issues for us. Any other social situation is usually easily dissipated or just something I choose to let go. I feel like I'm a relatively reasonable person. 

Can someone please provide some insight? These seem like minor issues, but I'm really considering a break.. I don't know if I want to break up yet, but these issues make me feel so unappreciated. I keep wondering if I could be with someone who acts as a partner to me in awkward social situations, and who really appreciates my body when I'm just being healthy. We currently live together, but I suggested to him that we should live separately when our lease is up. He asked if I wanted to break up, and I told him I hadn't thought that far. He said he thinks if we live apart, we'll just end up spending all our time together anyway, so it would be pointless. Part of me feels like if I move out and step back from the relationship for a while, I'll realize this is not what I want for myself. I haven't told him I want to take a break. I want to live separately, but still be exclusive to each other, try to hang out regularly, and just decide where to go from there. Am I being ridiculous? Should I just get over this stuff? Am I too immature for a relationship? And if so, should I be the one to end things?

TL;DR- I feel like my boyfriend makes comments about my (healthy) weight that other people don't seem to agree with. I also feel like he is not a partner to me in awkward social situations. I've tried to discuss these things with him. He apologizes about the weight and says I'm skinny to make me feel better. But I know him better than that. He flat out does not agree with me about specific social situations. I want to move out and take a break. I might be immature and overreacting.

Last night, I was doing bills and really needed some business envelopes and couldn't find any. Since my fiance does a lot of work at home, I figured he had some in his desk. That's when I found a recent bank statement, which he seemed to be hiding because it was located in a drawer that he usually keeps locked. I didn't think much of it until I saw the name of the bank and realized it was different than the one we use. The account had a balance of around $715,000.

When he came home last night, I didn't say anything. In fact, I just went straight to bed. I feel betrayed and disappointed in him. I'm not a gold digger, so I don't understand why he kept it a secret from me. Before we got engaged, we had a serious discussion about finances. We laid everything out on the table so there were no surprises and no secrets. Now this happens.

This morning, I wanted to confront him about it, so I got up early and went downstairs to check his desk for the statement and it was gone. I don't know if he hid it somewhere or threw it away, but now I have no proof. I checked the shredder but nothing was in there. It's like it never happened.

Needless to say, I'm struggling to figure out how I should approach him about this. I don't want him to think I was snooping through his stuff because I wasn't.

There have been a few, I mean only a few, instances where he starts to worry about things. This is almost always after a long day at work. His mood will suddenly change and he says he doesn't want to hurt me, or wants to make sure we are able to commit to each other, and other things of that matter. Last night he started worrying he was going to hurt me and let me down, and that he loves me but wonders if he'll get bored of me and the ""variety"" he's used to (we both have had sex with 20ish people, and agreed many times beforehand that hooking up is vastly overrated and not fulfilling). It was weird because this has NEVER been a problem between us before. He even stopped watching porn because only me naked would truly turn him on! It was like out of nowhere and he said he needed time to think.

From my past posts you will see that I've had problems being overly emotional due to some health-related things that were causing me mood swings. Since then, I have read almost 3 books, had a lot of space from my boyfriend (he's been on vacation this whole time and is back in 2 weeks), and reflected on myself a lot. When the two of us talk, it has been getting better and even loving, recently. We miss each other and are both committed to working things out. We agreed that we would take this time apart to try to better understand each other.

When we agreed to give each other space, I [posted on reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1sj15t/i_23f_have_been_sick_causing_me_to_be/), and many people told me that I was being overly emotional and should give him a break. At that time, I told him that I posted on reddit and many people were saying that he is great, and I should get my shit together. So, I took the initiative to read 3 relationship books, took time to seriously reflect upon myself, and realize what changes I can make to stop the fighting. 

Today, I asked him after a few weeks, what he is doing to improve our relationship. He told me that , I thought all our problems were because of you being emotional and that you should understand me better. I said it takes two people to keep a fight going on, that he also plays a role in any fight that we have, and that he should therefore also take the initiative to do some online reading about what he can change about himself. He said he does not need to, and that it is just common sense stuff that we both need to start implementing (i.e. be more compromising, undersatnding, etc). I got really annoyed that he was pretty much denying all responsibility for his own role in whatever fights we have, and got upset. He cut me off once in the conversation too, and I really felt like I was not being listened to, and that he was not trying to understand me. At one point he said, fine I'll read, but I was annoyed that he wasn't saying that because he**wanted** to read, but because he felt forced by me. I want him to want to fix this, I don't want him to feel forced into it. Anyways, someone at home was calling him for a while (I could hear it), and he had to go. He quickly apologized for everything and then we hung up. 

Just after that, I sent him an email outlining the specific things he said during the conversation which hurt me, that should be avoided in the future so that we don't fight as often. I am trying to communicate better with him, so instead of crying, I try to tell him in words how his specific actions caused me to feel certain ways. It's a pretty basic concept, I know, but I think I'm a [bit emotionally immature](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1srmmj/my_23f_emotional_immaturity_is_ruining_my/). 

I then called him around 45 minutes later to let him know that I emailed him, and assured him that I don't mean to escalate a fight, I just sincerely want him to know the specific things that he said that upset me, so we can avoid it in the future. He said he will read and respond to it in the morning when he wakes up.

58549,Relationships,2t6w4j,"Hi folks. 
In December my boyfriend, who I have been seeing since November 2013 went to Australia to begin a long travelling holiday (which he very much deserves). I'm going to meet up with him in an as yet undecided location this coming spring. 

The flat he was supposed to be sharing with our mutual Australian friend fell through, so he arrived in Sydney with nowhere to go, but he found somewhere eventually. He's been having a great time, as you'd imagine, but last week he dropped on me that he had bought an aeroplane ticket to Nepal, to go hiking to a 10 day meditation retreat. I was enthusiastic about the idea but miffed he hadn't warned me. Afterwards it transpired that the idea had come from his new housemate who had previously been. She's an ex model. She's painfully gorgeous to look at. He then noted that they would in fact be traveling together to and from the retreat. 
I didn't react at the time, which I know is wrong, but he was pretty enthused and I didn't want to be the bitch.
After thinking about it for a while, I concluded that I was unavoidably uncomfortable with the situation. So I told him, and to his eternal credit, accepted my reasons (after a while of defensiveness about how the meditation course itself is gender segregated).

Luckily, his housemate had not booked her tickets yet. He told her that I wasn't okay with them travelling together, and she was apparently very shocked, and asked outright if it was because I was judging her for her looks. 
Now I feel very confused. Am I in the wrong?  Feel pretty shitty.

TL;DR - boyfriend was going to go hiking in Nepal with his beautiful new housemate, I said I was uncomfortable and he told her. She implied I was being overly judgemental. is she right?

148623,Breakups,1nwzfq,"WARNING: 6740 letters

* The **beginning**

So I've met her in high school. She was the shy artsy rebel girl that's hard to notice. She did a decorative dashboard for the class, on which everyone had an envelope with his/her drawing and could message each other. Kind of. So one day I found a message from her, saying she is in love with me and I should tell her honestly what was my stance. I said I didn't know... but gave it a shot, since I haven't dated anyone ever.

So it began. We were both very shy and usually spent hours writing thoughtful messages, poems, and crafting little symbolic hand made gifts to each other. It was sweet as hell, but we were too shy to even date each other. So... we stopped after just a couple of weeks, maybe.

Years passed and I had become really interested in her in grade 4/5 in our school. So I started going out with her, this time for real. We were still pretty naive. She was an artist and I was a musician. Those were the most romantic months of my life. The kind, that you see in movies. We went stargazing, we went for walks in the cemetery and dozens of other dark places. We were walking in flowered spring forests and running through autumn leaves. We drew angels in the snow and unexpected hearts under our windows. We surprised ourselves constantly throughout our relationship and loved each other to death.

One day we even told each other we loved each other (in my native tongue there is a higher level for saying I love you), which was the most heart warming moment of the time, after which I told her I'd marry her if it wasn't frowned upon in this century. (we were still around 18-19 that time). We cried. A lot. Of joy. And even contemplated running away one time and starting a new life together, somewhere far far away. (I know). We told each other we would stay together forever and love each other forever.

---

* BUT, there was the **darker side** of this. 

One thing was the problem, that she was very...VERY sensitive. I mean, seriously. She would cry over the smallest things. She was also very introverted ( I mean, I looked like an extrovert compared to her and I'm certainly not one). She would be scared of break ups more than of death. Literally. (which in the end made her want to predominately break up with me like a dozen of times, because she was afraid) We were both kind of dark in nature and she was levels above me. She was the only person I knew to cut herself, when she did something she would regret. She would bring me a heart made of paper soaked with blood saying ""Love hurts"" after we had a fight. I still have that one. It was actually very artistic and macabre.

---

* **The end**

I wanted her to go to art university, which she always dreamed of, but was too afraid to attend. She then decided to go. (Nowadays she's the best in her class and one of the best in the whole school).

I was planning on going to a different town and she was planning to stay. She wouldn't want to go and I couldn't stay. So I started thinking about break up (I was so afraid of a distance relationship from stories).

And one day she came after me.. with bloody cuts all over her bloody hand, saying she is sorry. She was with one of her old artsy friends and he called her for a drink... two... (she wasn't the drinking type)... and she ended up sleeping with him.

I was shocked to the extent, that I didn't know how to react. My reaction was.. well.. shut down. I started to become more and more cold as time went on. She was worried and sad about it a lot. I couldn't help it... I realized what she had done in the next couple of months and the next time she brought up breaking up in an argument, I only said: ""fine"". Fine, let's break up, then. 

And we did. And she regretted it. And me too. But I decided to move on. She was begging. I said no. 

We both went to university. I went away, she stayed in my hometown.

I started missing her a couple of months later, exactly by the time I decided to change my profession and become a classical composer. Parents disagreed violently and I went back to my home town, still computer science university. Depressed. Disillusioned. Demotivated.

---

* We got **back together** somehow. 

For a very short time, since she would often say she ""does not expect anything"". Because of this, we agreed on breaking up. We were ""not meant to be"". 

Weeks... if not days later, she was in relationship with one of my good friends. I was devastated, still suffering from depressions about my life path, career visions, love life and life in general.

---

* I decided to **end my life**. 

I had no strength whatsoever and the depressions were pushing down on me. It was to that extent, that I became desensitized about myself in general and saw no reason whatsoever to continue.
I finished my last song and did it.

I was rescued and ashamed. Spent the next 2 and a half weeks in a psychiatric clinic. When I got out, I started a new life as a student of composition and cut off everything that reminded me of my past. 

Except for her.

I couldn't.

It has been almost 3 years since that. She has a new boyfriend, I have a new girlfriend (we both have been dating them for about 1.5 years now). 

The relationship is pretty stable and she is a wonderful girl. She supports me, I support her, we hold each other up when we're down, but there is a catch. I am her first great love.

She takes me as I took my ex. The best person she ever met. And she told me that. And I felt really worried. I felt, that I had managed to completely burn out my love on the first relationship. I love her, but... it's not the same. It is very calm and systematic. Not that tragic, not that romantic, but very stable. 

And I can't help to think of how much love I produced in a year and a half back then and how much love I produced in a year and a half now.

I am now feeding on melancholy once again and Can't seem to get her out of my head. I cannot imagine being with her and I cannot imagine being without her.

I wander the places we went to... that old tunnel we had a first kiss on.. that meadow that is now a housing estate.. I feed on the nostalgia and I feel bad. 

There's an inner feeling, that somehow, maybe, I'd be with her again. Maybe in 2 years... maybe in 5 years... maybe in 20 years... and the feeling is making me doubt my current relationship. 

I take it very seriously and simultaneously I take it as a temporary relationship to something else. I can't decide. I feel like a love wreck.

I'm a highly sexual person. I enjoy physical connection with the person I love. He doesn't seem to be interested in sex at all - even at the beginning, it was only (maybe!) twice a week. Now it's down to (maybe!) twice a month. We're young! We should be having sex 10 times at much, if not more. That's how it was for all my previous relationships.

I'm at the end of my tether. We've had discussions about it. We've had arguments about it. Both of us have threatened to kick / move me out of the flat. 

I've been living with 'Colin' for 7 months now. We saw each other for about 2 weeks before deciding this. Before anyone jumps the gun, let me preface by saying that he decided to move me into his place because I was raped at my old flat at a party. Once he heard, he made the decision. I warned him, I told him that it would be too much all at once, and that we should take our damn sweet time and think on it at least. But to be honest, I was desperate to move out after the incident 3 months prior. 


**More info:**

- **He has phimosis.** He claims sex is sometimes (read: all the time) uncomfortable for him as it hurts his foreskin, and it's too sensitive etc. He claims he's stretching it, which is what you're meant to do if you don't want surgery. But that's been his excuse now every time I try to initiate sex. I have to stretch it - it hurts. I masturbate every time I stretch it because the temptation is too great. FYI, I'm pretty sure he gets himself off at least 4 times a week due to 'stretching'.

- **He's emotionally unavailable.** I wouldn't mind the less sex if he was more mentally invested in us, but it doesn't seem to be the case. I few weeks back, I had a tumour scare. I guess that prompted some kind of reaction from him, because he started being incredibly nice and endearing, saying he loves me deeply, etc. After it turned out that it wasn't a tumour, he went right back to his old ways of ignoring me.



- **He called me needy and insecure**, that those qualities aren't attractive, and that, in turn, makes him not want to have sex with me. OK, fair enough - but the only thing I was 'needy' about was the sex. It's how I feel close to someone. I've never had someone reject my advances before, let alone for months! I feel like he's just using that as an excuse now. At first, it could have been legit. But I changed that, started taking care of myself more, ignoring my urges for him. I'm definitely not letting on that I'm physically needy for him. So now, of course, the excuse has changed to something else.

- **He said he finds sex 'disgusting'.** We had a brief exchange of words today and it turns out that apparently he's always found sex to be gross. Mainly because of the wetness (from me), pubes (both), and vagina smell. When he first told me about the last point, I was shocked; no one had ever said that to me before. On the contrary, all my past boyfriends have said that it smells/tastes great. So I started washing it better and more frequently, as to make it more appealing to him. But I guess the damage was already done.

Look. On a good day when I'm telling myself stuff like 'my pussy's fucking magic' (Amy Schumer stand-up), I'm not an unattractive person. I work out, I take care of myself, I dress well. But his attitude towards me is eroding what fake-confidence I have and leaving me with a knife in the bathroom, almost self-harming but not quite. Enough to take the edge off the pain of being rejected but not enough to leave scars. I wasn't going to mention that part. But I guess I have to be honest if I want real responses.

Is this relationship doomed? I feel like the bigger issue is that he's not eloquent, he can't put his emotions into words, 90% of the time he doesn't communicate well. 

That's not to say he has no good points. I just can't quite bring myself to type them up because I'm incredibly annoyed at him right now. So I guess this post will be a bit one-sided, but if you have questions, I am more than happy to answer them. 

Why do I want to make this work so bad? Is it something to do with my parents, Freud? Christ. The love is there, guys. I just don't know how to deal with feeling isolated in my own flat with the person who's meant to be more than just a roommate.

He was an international student. He graduated this past spring. Now, he's on Optional Practical Training, which means he has 90 days to find a job of volunteer position that's at least 20 hours a week and in his field of study (History). As long as he does, he can continue to stay and work in the US for a year. I will graduate in the spring of next year, so obviously I would prefer to get married after I graduate.

34053,Relationships,3b8cca,"Let me preface this by saying that this is my first major relationship, and I love this girl dearly. Throwaway, because she reddits.

I'm out of state for work, and my girlfriend and I decided that it'd be a good idea for her to come with me. I rented a house cheap, and we figured that cohabitation for the 2 months or so I'd be working would be good for us. Currently, we're about 4 weeks into it. 

We fight about twice a week and it's driving me crazy. She gets agitated by the smallest things. I think part of it is that she's struggled in finding short-term employment, so she's stuck in a house alone for 11-13 hours a day while I'm working and maybe longer if I'm out with other interns, or staying late for OT. 

Despite this knowledge, I feel like I'm going mad. She gets on my case for insignificant things, like unplugging charging cords because it wastes electricity, even though she'll leave the air conditioning blasting in rooms she's not in. 

On days when we're super affectionate, or have sex, things are great. Otherwise we fluctuate wildly between normal, tolerable. Otherwise we're arguing. Furthermore, her emotions seem to be front and center in our interactions. I try to be empathetic, but honestly, I feel like some of the things that she gets hurt about are petty at best and her working herself into a mood at worst. 

Yesterday, before bed [NSFW incoming] I felt a bit horny. She'd been sick all day, so instead of asking for help from her, I went to the second bathroom downstairs, so she wouldn't have to hear my porn. I come upstairs afterwards, and she's waiting, asking why I was downstairs for so long. After I tell her, she immediately gets quiet and storms out, to sit on the stairs and cry. 

I get up to comfort her, (mind you it's already late) and ask her what's wrong. All she could say is that she's feeling something but doesn't know what. She starts to analyze why I went downstairs instead of asking her, and I tell her it's just because she was sick and I felt like going downstairs. No huge rhyme or reason to it. Thinking it's settled, I head to bed. 

Cue her waking me out of my bed several times, calling me an asshole, or saying how I should just go sleep on the couch if I want peace and quiet so I can sleep (mind you, I'm the only one paying rent atm). I ask groggily and nicely repeatedly, turning off the lights only to have them turned on again, until I snap out of my sleep for the 4th time and scream at her to leave me the fuck alone. 

She breaks down, and the last thought I have before drifting off is that I could care less at this point. Flash to today, I left her sleeping. She hasn't texted and I don't want to go home to her yet. I actually want overtime so I can avoid it. I hate that I screamed at her, but her grievances have gotten so petty and her emotions so sensitive, that I can't seem to care. 

I need help. I have 6 more weeks of this and I'm finding it harder to genuinely care about her concerns. Am I an asshole? What do we/I do?

The main problem is that I show her affection in order to make her feel appreciated and loved, but she is much more of an introvert than me. She does not show much much affection at all. I know it sounds clingy and needy (which I will admit that at some points I can be) but its really bothering me.
I do not understand what the heck she is doing anymore. She says she needs some more space with her friends so I give her more space with her friends. But the thing is she gives me practically NO affection. It's like a slap in my face when I see her with her friends because she is always so happy to see them, but never seems happy to see me.
Firstly, she will never initiate affection. If I want a hug, kiss or even to text, I have to do it first. Secondly, she will just disappear on me sometimes. Like right now, I was talking with her about this and sharing my feelings and all of a sudden she just stops texting me. In the middle of our conversation. Again, I know it sounds petty and all, but it bothers me because it feels disrespectful. So then, when I give her more space by giving her more time to hang out with her friends, it honestly just feels like she is dissatisfied with our relationship because she doesn't show me affection. Does that make sense?
I just get so frustrated over all of this because it just seems so obvious to me ""when you love someone, you show them that you love them, that they are special to you and that you are attracted to them"".
But I want to be clear, we are not the couple that makes out in public or even holds hands. We are very private about our physical relationship with each other, but even in private, when its just her and I it seems like I need to coarse her into showing affection.
I know people might be thinking that ""oh man, she doesn't love you anymore""... But I don't think thats true. She says that its just the way she is and that she still loves me and all.

So I live in a small hip town. I am an artisan in a certain area of craft. I am good but yet unknown. I have known G for a few years casually, at first because his name is well known around town because of his talent and craftsmanship (yes I am keeping this intentional vague). We have been acquaintances for a few years.

About two months ago, I intentionally met him in a bar to show him the results of a project he helped me piece togethher. As one may predict, we ended up back at his place and had very weird, stiff and awkward sex (he initiated.. It was not my intention to meet him for sex but it seemed spontaneous.)

Over the next month and a half we continued to see each other intimately , though I was always only half into the sex because it sucked. I was surprised to learn that he thought it was the best sex ever. I was into G as a person, and I had romantic feelings towards him.

So as we continue being intimate, he slowly reveals he has a primal urge to impregnate me. I told him again and again, gently since I suspected it was some kind of fetish, that we should be careful, I'm not ready to be a mom.

(I've been using the pullout method and careful tracking of my period for years with no I'll results. Yes now I know how stupid that was but it was actually pretty reliable , even with what I'm about to say.)(I hope this is coming off at least somewhat comical because otherwise it's just embarrassingly idiotic) 

I let my boyfriends cum inside of me when I know I'm nowhere near ovulation (basically right around my period). I guess G took this gesture and got a little spoiled:One day we're having stiff awkward wheezing sex and I'm on day 14 of my cycle ( I know I'm ovulating because I felt slight cramps) and all of the sudden he says he's gonna cum inside. I guess I was taken aback because we had discussed many times that cumming inside during ovulation was off limits. In a reflex of utter stupidity and reactivity I just said ""okay"", thinking ""well,if I just piss it out I'll be okay"" having myself been spoiled from years of no pregnancies (but I had never let anyone cum inside of me while ovulating!!)

Flash forward two weeks. Two day late period. I am roused awake by my unusually sore tits. I take a test and yep... It's positive.

I was sure that when I confronted him, he would try to convince me to keep it. Thankfully he didn't. But here begins ""The Week that Ended our Friendship"".

Since we were about to embark on the ultimate bonding experience, we began spending every moment together. All of his annoying habits had increased in volume by five times. Despite my begging him to stop compulsively songbombing me 8-10 times a day, he continued to do so, as a sign of disrespect. His kisses and touches were irritating ... He makes a loud smacking noise every time he gives a stiff-puckered kiss. I told him about this too, and he again refused to hear it. He became increasingly affectionate and his muggy touch became irritating. And all he would ever talk about is everything and everyone he hated/disliked (music, art, people, movies, etc).

I stuck with him until after the procedure, biting my tongue with every songbomb. It was torturous. I was pregnant, hormonal, unable to exercise and filling up with aggression that I was keeping bottled up (he shut down emotionally every time I tried to address the irritating things he did/accused me of trying to change him/ etc.)

The procedure went well enough, we split the costs, and proceeded to spend the next two days together. I was groggy, uncomfortable and hormonal. Though he continued to do irritating things, full well knowing I found them irritating (aspergers?) I attempted at one point to say something nice, amid the looming anxiety and stress... I said ""I'm so lucky to know you,"" and I meant it. How did he respond? Without looking up, and with a totally serious and stern tone says , ""you better not forget it."" I waited for a smile, or a ""just kidding"", anything. There was nothing.

We talked about past relationships and he mentioned that he has terrible luck with women (rly?) to which I replied ""oh but what about all those girls who send you tit pics on the Internet?"" And very bitterly he replied, ""yeah, they only like me because I'm famous."" In almost an accusatory tone. I said ""well we don't really get to choose why people are attracted to us, do we? For example I wish people were attracted to me because of my talent. But guys only want me for my tits and ass."" He got a mad look on his eyes and said,""no, I think I'm the only guy who wants your ass!! Whenever I see it I just imagine bending you over and ramming it in!!""

I was shocked and felt somewhat violated by his response, since I just went through a surgical procedure in my fucking uterus to remove a mistake that had been rendered sexually... And I also felt he was confirming my sad suspicion that even HE was attracted to nothing more than my ass.

""You're still a young man. Someday you'll grow up and learn not to speak to women like that"" I said. He apologized moments later.

We didn't speak for a day or so. Then he sent me a text saying I miss you. I'm pretty sure it was my hormones combined with residual hurt feelings but this incensed me. I didn't know how to respond. A few minutes later he asked if I was okay. I said things got serious too fast between us and I think we should be friends. I was hoping truly to remain friends. He didn't respond.

The following day I sent a text asking if he hated me now. By this time the ""surgical procedure"" was really taking effect and I was bleeding and in a lot of pain. No response. I began to get angry and hurt.
""Enjoy having your life return to normal while mine is ruined for the next month. I'm bearing the brunt of our mistake. Have some sympathy please?"" No reponse for hours.

""You're a really mean person,"" I said. He finally responded, saying don't you dare call me mean, you've got some nerve saying that.

I went on to tell him how he is afraid to confront himself, that he is a negative person, not relationship material, is harsh with his words, and hates everything. He said I'm acting crazy, weird, and that I'm alienating him, don't know him at all and wasn't paying attention. He said I just wrecked everything. I asked if he thought it was okay to ignore the girl he impregnated and just had an abortion? He said that's how he deals with sadness (avoidance).

So anyway. As you can see we're both lunatics but it's par for the course. I just wanna know if I did anything really out of hand, that would indicate that I'm a bad person, as I am feeling some (probably ) hormonal related guilt. Really I was as honest and thorough as I could possibly be. Thanks.

At first it was that his lies would be exposed through events and now I just have a sixth sense and pretty much know when he's lying. It's always bothered me but I don't know what to say about it. I know he does it so I won't get mad - he does this to everyone in his life. His friends will invite him out and he'll say he has to help his parents instead of just saying no. We are LD so most of it happens as I ask about his day.

Examples:
-He started hanging out with a female friend alone frequently, I asked if she had ever been to his house, he said no but one time he was giving her a ride and she said, ""Oh, it's right by your house"" so when she left I asked and he admitted she had been over. This was the lie that I first caught and it did happen about 2 years ago. 

-He had to take a semester off of school and he hid it from his parents. Not just like lying by omission but he would leave the house and go sit at the library for hours pretending he was in class.

-He'll never really tell me what he's doing, when, who with etc. I'll ask about his day and he'll tell me he just played video games all day. Later I'll find out he was at the beach with friends or something. Like a completely pointless lie, what do I care whether he was at the beach or not?

-His new thing is saying thigs that are blatantly false. I asked him if he was still splitting his car bill with his parents, just out of curiosity. He said yes, he was paying the full amount and so were they to get the car paid off quicker. His parents are broke and bad with money so that made no sense. I just said, ""You're lying"" and he was. 

That last one is happening literally every day, he will say something just so illogical I say ""Babe you're lying"" and he says ""I know"" and we kind of laugh and move on. I'm having a really hard time figuring out how to respond because I don't want to get mad and make him more determined to lie better or something but it's really interfering with my ability to trust him. I don't BELIEVE he's doing anything shady, I think he just lies out of habit, but I also wouldn't be surprised at all. So how do I approach this with him?

Here's the problem: there's no chemistry/passion anymore. He feels more like my best friend than a long-term SO. We rarely have sex anymore, mostly because I don't feel like it, not in general, just about him (there's no one else, it's just to say it's not a general lack of libido)  He's not a bad looking guy, he just doesn't put any effort into initiating. His idea of getting me in the mood is just to come over and grab my tits out of the blue. Not a huge turn on for me, and I've expressed this before. I've never been super madly in love with him, it's always been more of a slow burning, easy going relationship. Maybe this is why? I met him after a truly horrific breakup so I didn't want anything insanely passionate and crazy at the time we met, but I'm at the point where I do again. 

There's also no effort on his part to initiate any romance or dates into the relationship. I have to set up everything when it comes to dates. It's rare that he will set up a fun thing for us to do together, or if ever, come up with the idea on his own. Not that I mind trying new places I want to go, but it feels like unless I plan it out, it's not happening. It wasn't always this way, which is why I'm so frustrated. I want to go places he wants to go as well but he never drops hints, I have to outright ask. I'm not sure if this is because I'm his second SO, and his first serious relationship, and he's just in-experienced. 

It's been like this for over a year now and we had a long talk the other night about how this isn't working for me, and what I want out of a relationship, and out of my partner. While I hope he improves upon these things I don't want him changing who he is just because I want him to, it's not fair to him, but I made it clear that if he doesn't want to change then we shouldn't continue to be together. I'm giving it a few months to see if he changes his habits, but in my past experience people are who they are. He's not a very emotional person so the conversation was even keeled, he didn't seem upset at the prospect of breaking up, but he didn't seem relieved either.

My boyfriend revealed to me a few nights ago that he cheated one night when we first started dating back in May. We'd been sleeping together casually a few months prior, but there was no one else involved on either end. He was in tears the entire time he told me about it, saying that I deserve better and he'd understand if I left. I let it slide, and have no intentions of leaving. He swore that it wouldn't happen again and I truly want to believe him but I just can't get myself over it. I want to move past this and be happy with him but we've talked about how it upsets me every night since then. He's offered to show me his texts and social media messages, but I know that they won't help me get past this. Part of the reason that it's got me so worked up is that we've been essentially living together since we started dating and I hate the thought that he was with someone and then slept with me in my bed a few nights afterwards. I just don't know how to forgive/trust him again.

Sorry for the wall of text.

My so is a recovering addict (heroin, and other opiates) and I recently figured out that she's been lying to me about her drug abuse. Currently she has a legit xanax prescription among a few others (klonopin, tramadol).

 Months ago, I for sure caught her snorting her scrips in the bathroom... I heard it... I saw her take something into the bathroom, heard her crush something... Heard her snorting something... I asked her, and her response was that she was blowing her nose. But she got her guilty face on. Wouldn't look at me for an hour, played the victim, saying that she's changed her life, and didn't want to be thought of as. ""Just a junkie."" I bought it all hook line and sinker. 

Last week, she started huffing duster at my house. She fell, kicked an ashtray off the balcony, and smashed my porch light fixture. She felt terrible, I got pissed... Etc. The next nigh t she felt so bad she didn't feel comfortable coming to my house, and tried to go home several times. I wouldn't let her, because she was hammered and way past driving... Not that she couldn't have called a cab if she wanted to. But that night we had a serious talk, and she promised me that she wouldn't do duster again. 

A few nights later she was back again huffing duster in her bathroom... I pretended not to notice... But then the next night she was back at it... And finally fell and shoved everything off her counter, then called out to me for help. When I opened the bathroom door, she immediately tried to tell me, ""shut the door, there's nothing going on in here. I'm not doing anything.""

This really shook my trust because I asked her, ""please no more duster; the high you're getting from it is 10X more dangerous than nitrous, and you I have plenty of weed, etc... If you want nitrous, we can get you nitrous.""

I left to smoke a cigarette, and when she came back she played the victim, she went straight to, ""I'm sorry, I'm a drug addict. I always end up ruining the only good things in my life... Will you ever forgive me? Please? I swear on our relationship, on the simple fact that I love you that I'll never get high off duster... And if I feel the need to get high, I'll just smoke weed...""

I said alright, I told her I was disappointed. But I bought it. Fast forward a week. She's been over twice, and I have since bought a new can of duster to replace the one she kicked. I haven't used it... But its been moved at least 3 times. When were at her house, she's been using the upstairs bathroom whenever she needs to go. But also, when she does use the downstairs bathroom, she takes literally 1/10th of the time she used to. 
This has got me thinking, what else has she been doing right in front of me, with only running water as her cover. I thought back to the time I asked her if she was snorting pills in my bathroom, and I remembered the look on her face. I'd seen that look two times since then, both involving the duster binge.

So, I waited till she was in the shower, went and found her pill clutch, opened it, and confirmed my own suspicions... I found an old bent credit card, a small paper weight, with white powdery residue on them. Then I found three straws, along all caked with white powder and one had a hint of green residue, and then all her prescribed meds, suboxone, tramadol, xanax, klonopin...

 So... Its clear that she has been snorting her meds. Which, I just think is a slippery slope as a recovering opiate addict, more so I'm pissed that she lied about it. But if I couple that with my duster suspicions... I'm sitting on enough evidence to confront her... Right?

Last night, after work my buddy told me a story that he had just heard from her. She was in the storage room, and found a can of duster, and was huffing it, only to turn around and see one of the cooks standing there. She was relaying this to my best friend, for the purpose of telling him that she had an awkward moment with this particular cook. Just an anecdote. Of course my buddy tells me, because he just found out everything I wrote above. 

So I finally get to confront her about this, and you know... I couldn't. I told her I felt like she was hiding something from me, specifically that I don't trust that she's not doing duster anymore. Her response was, ""well, I am completely honest with you about what I do, and you night be the only person who I actually am honest with... If you don't believe me... That's your problem"" then she kissed me, told me she loved me, and went to sleep. 

I'm not sure how to handle this. My emotional world has been rocked, and all trust is gone now. I didn't want to believe she had the ability to lie to my face like that... And I couldn't bring myself to tell her that I knew. Because I feel like its just gonna turn into me being, ""controlling, over protective, etc... Boyfriend""

We pretty much spend the entire weekend together doing things like going to a concert and riding bikes around town (including sleeping over at one another's places; though we have not engaged in any sexual activity besides making out). 

I have not been attracted to anyone like I am to her for a very long time—it's actually very refreshing! Both of us want to be involved in a genuine good long term relationship, and I would like to have a relationship with her. Perhaps I'm overthinking, but I'm really wondering about how two persons should be ""seeing"" one another before bringing up the idea of being ""official."" Part of me wants to ask this question this weekend (she told me once that she had 7 dates with a guy and wondered herself whether that'll go anywhere), and we've definitely spent more than 7 dates worth of time with one another. Thus, I want to tell her that I think we can go somewhere together in the sense of being ""officially"" in a relationship. Is two weeks too short, or should I just take the risk, even if it's not even there, and tell her how I feel? 

I probably won't see her in person until Friday. She's coming to see my band play a gig and I really feel like asking her afterwards would be good timing. Thoughts/advice/insights?

TL;DR: Recently started seeing a girl to whom I am really attracted, and who likes me back too; wondering whether asking her to be my SO after two weeks of seeing each other (though we spent A LOT of time together) is too early.

57100,Relationships,2inmss,"So, I'm an active member of our college's drama club. We've been working hard for almost 2 months for a play that we were going to perform. We were going to have the largest audience our college has ever had and it was quite a big deal. Now, I wasn't the protagonist, but I had quite a big part. I'll omit the unnecessary details about my character. The important part is that I have a lover (this other girl in our drama club) and I have most of my scenes with her. We kiss thrice during the play.

As soon as I read the stage directions during the script reading, I told my girlfriend about it. We've been dating for a year now and things were great. She lives across the campus so she's busy with her own life and can't visit me much during our run-throughs. So I told her that this was a big deal for me and I really wanted to do this part. I told her about the kissing part and she was kind of sad about it, but she said that I needed to do it. But she also said that I can't hang out with this girl outside the context of the play. I agreed.

So, the final showing was 2 days before. It was an awesome show and truly a once in a lifetime experience. Especially with such a big audience. The show comes to an end, and we're just really happy with how it went. Naturally we're just going and telling the others how great it was and all that. So the girl I who was my lover in the play comes up to me grinning from ear to ear and hugs me and telling me how great the show went. So she's still hugging me and I see my girlfriend already in tears a little faraway. It was clear to me that she had already been crying before, and that this didn't start immediately. I immediately break our embrace and run over to her and she just bolts in the other direction. I catch up with her and she's very obviously crying, calling me all sorts of names. I manage to stop her. Amongst all of the things she said then, these are the most important :

 - You didn't tell me that you'd be making out with *Kathy* (She is a pretty hot girl)
 - You've never kissed me like that
 - Its obvious she likes you, trying to make out with you even after the play
 - I clearly saw that you liked kissing her so much
 - Now I know why you've been so busy with the play. God knows how many times you guys made out in practice

So, yeah. Its been 2 days. She's been ignoring me. We don't have the same classes but we do eat together and she spends the evenings at my place.

To clarify, I only kissed Kathy in our final run-through because our director wanted the entire thing sealed. Kathy wasn't trying to kiss me after the play, we were just celebrating a decent performance by hugging. Also, it wasn't decided who I'd be kissing when I told her about it, because the previous girl opted out of the play.

So, where to go from here ? I've apologised a million times already.

Also, her friend told me that she's been crying a lot.

5980,Dating,358l0f,"What's happened between us thus far: she texts me saying she wants to take my virginity, the next day we go to a 40 year old coworkers house after all 3 of us close the store and she kisses me once the coworker is gone, a week of constant basic conversational texting, she gets mad (she says because she had to go to court) and stops texting, we go to coworkers house again where nothing happens, texting picks up a little but never fully recovers, I go into see her at work once or twice a week where she still acts fairly happy to see me.

 Outside of work all we've done is texted and gone to a coworkers house twice. I've told her we could do something together whenever she wants (nothing yet though). The two times we went to the coworkers house she would choose to ride with him instead of me.

My concern is that in the first week (on week two or three now) she would initiate texting, but now she won't text me unless I text her, and her texts seem more effortless. The day will go by silently unless I send a text first and even then I'm mostly carry the conversations. I would take that as a sign that she's losing interest, but on the other hand when I go into our work to see her she'll still act happy to see me and walks with me back out to my car to talk. She gave me a hug goodbye today.

I'll admit that I may be a bit too tiptoe-y approaching this whole thing (because I'm not sure how fast is too fast and how slow is too slow - she knows I've never had a girlfriend before). I wouldn't blame her if she lost interest in me because of that. I've said some pretty cringy new-to-relationships stuff too.

Texting was primarily how we communicated since we only work together once a week. So now that she's not really bothering to text me, yet still acting pretty open when I visit her at work, I'm not sure what to make of this. Is she losing interest, but too afraid to tell me that yet? Or is this some kind of test or is she respecting that I've never done this sort of thing before and thus she's moving slowly? Should I send her a message right now? What do I say?

TL;DR: Isn't texting like she used to, but still shows a fair amount of happiness when I visit. Losing interest but too afraid to tell me yet?

26268,Relationships,2zw7iy,"Dating for a year. We see each other at weekends only. I am studying and have a job some evenings, and he works only during the week but long hours. Since he has the weekend off I try to do all my studying during the week so we can spend time together. I'm totally exhausted by the weekend and I like to lie in til around 9 or 10 to catch up on sleep. He knows this.

This problem might sound really dumb but it's starting to drive me crazy. He won't stop cuddling me when I'm asleep. E.g. It's 7am on a Saturday morning and I'm enjoying my lie in, when I get woken up by him literally manhandling me to start cuddling and kissing me. I'm like, dude I'm asleep. I have to shove him off me to get some breathing space, but he's all you're so moody, why don't you want to cuddle. An hour later, same thing happens again. This happens pretty much every weekend. I've spoken to him about it but he just ignores it. If I freak out while he does it, he gets all pissy. If I speak to him seriously about it get goes off in a mood about it. And regardless, he will then do it again the next day or weekend.

Similar to this he also does similar things while I'm awake. He will interrupt me working (studying) to talk about random things and then demand kisses by sticking his head in front of my laptop so I can't see my work. Or when I'm driving. 

It's the two things together that annoy me - 1. the constant touching and cuddling, at inappropriate times, 2. the fact I've said I hate it and he ignores me and does it anyway, plus the way he goes off in a mood like a little child having a temper tantrum.

What can I do? I'm getting to the point where I'm going to physically push him away because I don't want to be disturbed when I'm sleeping. I'm exhausted right now. And I don't want to kiss him on demand.

Edit: Wow I got a lot of responses. I've read each and every one, thank you all so so much for the many different perspectives. To clarify a couple things:

1. Before I met my BF I both worked at my part time job and studied on the weekend. He works long hours but week days only, so now I have a very intense week and take as much of the weekend off as I can, so that I can see him. But sometimes I still have to do a bit of college work. We could see each other in the week but it would be literally for sleep time, which would end up not being just sleep time... so we'd be even more tired.

2. I am totally cuddly! But not at very specific times (sleeping, working, driving). At every other time - yeah! We are a gross PDA couple hahah. This is why I don't understand why he wakes me up for kisses, when I happily provide them 80% of my waking time.

3. Yes I do like/love him! Apart from this he is amazing and we have a great time together.

27865,Breakups,1vizfv,"So I broke up with my girlfriend of over a year because the flare had died for me. I just wasn't passionate about the relationship anymore. I've been feeling regret about that decision though and wanting her back so I decided to really try to analyze my emotions. 

I realized I broke up with her for a few reasons. I'm attracted to my ex but she wasn't the most attractive girl ever. I'm also into slim girls and she was curvy. Not fat at all but just not my biggest preference. Overall I would have rated her a 7 probably and I felt like I could be with someone more attractive. 

Next she's a bit of the quieter type and I think I was starting to feel cooped up and just wanted to go out and have a good time with friends. Well I've been doing that but that burned out fast, just sort of a phase. I'm looking to lay low for a bit, which is what I would have done with her anyways. 

Looking back at it, we really connected. There's no one else I could be so open with. I'm more prone to stay in and do nothing and she was an amazing motivator for me to go out and do things like hike which I really do enjoy. 

Basically I don't know if my emotions now are right and she's the one for me, or if my panic state was my emotions coming to the surface and I shouldn't be with her.

161163,Relationships,2uy9kt,"Throwaway because family and friends know my account. A little backstory before I get to the point, I(20M) met my current girlfriend(18F) in class this past fall and we hit it off immediately. We hung out a few times and then promptly went on several awesome dates and ended up falling head over heels. She is a beautiful, charismatic woman who can brighten an entire room with her presence. We're alike and different in all the right ways, and we truly make each other happy. I get along beautifully with all of her friends and family as well as her mine. We both genuinely love each other. In a vacuum were perfect for one another. 

   However, there is an ex-boyfriend of hers that she dated in high school for 2-3 years and just recently broke up with (for good) in June. She has been open about their breakup and from what I understand they were very happy and had a great relationship until they broke up for a period of time and she kissed some random guy at a party and the ex-boyfriend found out and lost it. 

Somehow they ended up getting back together shortly after and dated happily (i assume) until June when it all went wrong. They were both very intoxicated at a party and he ended up shoving her against a wall and had to be restrained from physically harming her by bystanders. She dumped him and hasn't dated him since, but they did have sex once or twice in the month or two after the incident but she refused to take him back. She also dated a guy or two in the fall following the incident before we started dating but things just didn't work out with the guy for one reason or another.

Enter me. During the first month or two of us dating I notice the abusive ex-boyfriend constantly blowing up her phone whenever she was around. By blowing up I mean he would call her 10 times consecutively even though she forwarded his calls or just plain ignored them. She would never entertain him while she was around me (which was very frequently) but would usually return his calls or texts when she got home. He said everything to her from confessing his love to calling her a stupid bitch or whore. I then began to take offense to this and expressed to her how immature and pathetic he was for doing this to her. She would generally agree with me and say she blocked him from everything but it usually never lasted more than a week or so. I expressed repeatedly how much I disliked that she even responded to his texts or calls and that all he wants is her attention and she would usually say something like ""fine ill block him"" and i would usually tell her that i dont want her to do something she doesnt want to do but that i just didnt understand why she was doing this to herself. Understandably she would get very stressed out over him because of his persistence as well as the things he would say to her.

For the most part I was always very patient and level headed when it came to him because i understand they have a lot of history and that some things just take time. She always reassured her love for me and that he was not a threat to our relationship. 

Things started to slow down as time went by and I heard less about his abusive actions. She would pretty regularly get a phone call or text from him around me but not to the degree it once was. This was in late November/early December and I assumed that things were starting to fizzle out between them and she was starting to move on. However, throughout the holidays and new year they were still talking pretty regularly (more regularly than a person in a committed relationship should talk to their ex, maybe a couple phone calls and texts a week). After bringing it up to her she did confess that she met up with him a few times while we were dating but that it was nothing more than to just talk. She said they would usually just catch up talk about their lives and that it wasn't anything more. He told her he was in love with her one time and according to her she told him she wasn't and that he cried and she left. 

Fast forward to this past week, the communication between them hasn't changed. At this point we have been exclusive for about 4 months and Im at the point where Im waiting for an opportunity to tell her that this has been going on too long enough and to let her know that keeping in constant communication with her ex boyfriend is undermining our relationship and that I am not okay with it. Recently she has been feeling very under the weather, she took a semester off school and has nothing to do all day so she has been in somewhat of a funk. She decided to return home for a few days to see her mom and get out of the college town we live in for a couple days. 

She texted me last night saying she needed to talk to me about something and that she wanted to do it in person. She drove home 2 hours at 3 am and came straight to my house but instead of waking me up and talking she just cuddled with me and we went to sleep because I had two exams today and needed to sleep. So this afternoon we met up and she came over to discuss whatever she needed to talk to me about. She said that she was feeling really depressed and was considering telling me she wanted to maybe take a step back and maybe take a break or something until she figured out what was going on with her when she left town but that she had a good time with her girlfriends back home and changed her mind. I took this opportunity to get the way I felt about her ex-boyfriend off my chest by telling her I think the amount of communication they have is abnormal and that she knows how uncomfortable it makes me feel when they talk, yet she continues to do it anyway. I then said that her actions basically tell me that she cares more about talking to her ex than keeping me comfortable in the relationship and that I didn't think she was over him. She tried to defend herself by saying they don't even talk that much but eventually realized that i was serious about it. She then said i basically reinforced her feelings about needing to just take a step back and clear her head and i told her to do whatever she needs to do. I also feel like i need to think things over and get a little bit of space. So we decided to take a break. We agreed to basically just hang out less for a little bit and give each other a bit of space but we aren't separated and agreed not to date or hookup with other people.

Keep in mind during our whole relationship we've been practically inseparable, spending the night at each others places very frequently. We never really fight, have a healthy sex life, go on regular dates that are always new and fun. For instance our last date was a trip into Atlanta to ride the ferris wheel at sunset, ice skate, shop, and eat at a fancy restaurant on top of the tallest building in the city. We truly are great together and i can see it in her eyes how crazy she really is about me. Even when she was feeling depressed I could usually show her a good time and lift her spirits. I think she loves and wants to be with me but that she's in a point in her life (18 just moved out on her own) where she has a lot going on and wants to figure out what the hell wants. Whereas im a little more settled as im in my 3rd year of college. I dont feel as if im the rebound guy because shes been involved and in a relationship with a couple of guys since the crazy ex.At first i felt good for standing up for myself but now I'm feeling very anxious and a little scared about this break. As of right now Im willing to give her some space and let her think about whether she's ready to truly put her ex in her past and commit to me. But Reddit:

This has never been a problem with us until the last month or so when she started talking about living the young person experience and dating/getting to know other people.

150619,Non-Romantic,3e1pqt,"To give some background info, I live with my boyfriend of 5 years. Have been living with him for 3. Recently we decided to move for college, and decided to move in with my friend of 7 years to save on costs while we are going to school. My boyfriend have been living alone for 3 years, while this is my roommates first time living on her own. We found a great 3 bedroom basement suite for $1,200 a month. My boyfriend and I pay $800 and she pays $400. We have no extra bills, everything is included in the rent. Our damage deposit was $1200, $600 for the regular damage and $600 for the pet deposit. Roommate paid a third of the regular deposit, but nothing for the pet deposit because we have 2 cats and a dog and she had no pets at the time. All of that seemed very fair to me.


My roommate is an alcoholic. I didn't realize just how bad it was until I moved in with her. She spent a lot of time at my old house, during which times she rarely ever drank. Now that I live with her I realized that she drinks almost every night. If I have liquor in the house (SN: I am from Canada where the legal drinking age is 19) she will drink it. It is at the point where I have had a bottle of liquor in the freezer that she has drank without my permission and had to replace 6 times now. Within 2 months. 


Due to that, she is very irresponsible with money. She doesn't go to school and works a part time job at a fast food restaurant. She refuses to work full time and said herself that it is because she is ""lazy."" Constantly, she is complaining about being broke or lacking necessities, yet will spend money on alcohol without a second thought. I would really have no problem with this, as it is not my business, if it did not leak into my life as well. It is a lot of little things, like eating mine and my boyfriends food or expecting us to buy everything for the house (toilet paper, laundry soap, bath mat, dish rack, curtains, etc.) while she contributes nothing. I tried to get her to pitch in $30 for a vacuum, and that was like pulling teeth. I bought the vacuum but did not see the money until very recently when I stopped letting her use it until she helped pay. It is also like that when I ask her to replace the food of ours that she ate, or at least give us back the money to buy it ourselves.


In addition to her money problems, her alcoholism attributed to another big issue between us. She constantly has friends over. Every day. (I am very introverted). We have already received two complaints from our landlords, who live upstairs, about having too many people in the suite. This caused a big problem which we did end up working out, though it almost got me fired. (Long story).

I also feel the need to add as background info that she has a very short temper with my pets. She constantly complains about the house being ""overrun"" with animals. She screams at my dogs and cats when they annoy her. One time when my dog was barking she hit him. It was hard enough that I could hear it on the other side of the suite and he yelped from pain. I freaked out at her and told her that if it ever happened again she would have to move out, and it seems to have stopped. She also had a cat and a dog before she moved out that her mother had to adopt because she didn't care for them properly.


So that is the basis for my distrust of her. In contrast, there also are good things about living with her. She is very cleanly and picks up after herself very well. I like living with her because I am comfortable around her due to being friends with her for so long. I never feel awkward about anything and despite being very insecure I trust her around my boyfriend. Her and my boyfriend also click very well. I feel that she is my only close friend that I can live with. I will admit, I am very controlling. I talk down to her frequently because I view her as very childish and incapable of making responsible decisions. Understandably, this really bothers her. She has expressed in the past that she does not like that she feels she has no control over anything in the house. She thinks that I dictate everything and nothing happens unless it is approved by me. She told me that because she pays a third of the rent, she shouldn't have to ask before bringing friends over late at night or getting a cat. I also have pretty bad anxiety so I freak out if things are sprung on me unexpectedly, and obsess over planning every minor detail.


This is why, when she suddenly sprung the fact that she is getting a kitten to me over Facebook I kind of freaked out. I haven't seen her most of the week because she is house sitting for her mom. And then all of a sudden I get a Facebook telling me she is getting a kitten. She just made the decision without even talking to me or my boyfriend. My first reaction was to ensure she had the money to get a kitten. Reminding her of the costs of getting her spayed, flea treatment, shots, supplies, etc. I kind of did this in a way to make her change her mind about the kitten. For someone who constantly needs to get her dad to send her 100s of dollars, and spent the money he gave her for Augusts rent, I truly do not think that she can afford a kitten. It was free, and I truly believe she has not given thought to the other costs. She pretty much deflected all of this, saying she doesn't need to get the kitten spayed because it is only 8 weeks, and that flea treatment can wait until her next pay check in early August. I'm trying to tell her that no, flea treatment can't wait, because we don't know if the cat has fleas already or whatnot, but she doesn't listen to me.  For the record, I do think that she should be allowed to have a kitten if she wants. Our landlords have no rules about pets and have many themselves. I do not think it would be fair of me to tell her to not have a kitten when I have 3 animals. I'm just concerned about money, and whether the kitten is going to be cared for properly. 


I talked to my boyfriend about it and he suggested that if she wanted a kitten, she should have to give us some money from the pet deposit. We thought it would be fair if she paid a quarter ($150), and then she would get it back when she moved out. However, I wanted her to pay it before the kitten comes home because I feel as though she will bring the kitten here and never pay us the money. When I asked her about this she started getting really upset. She said I was ruining her happiness, and that she shouldn't have to pay part of the pet deposit when it has already been paid, and it was much more likely for the 3 of my pets to do damage that her 1 cat. But she would get it back if her cat caused no damage, and if she doesn't pay us, and the cat does do damage, then it will come out of our pocket. Which isn't really fair. 


We continued to talk and started calming down after she agreed to try to pay it when she sprung on us that she got a bill in the mail for $300 (due to an underage drinking ticket she received a year or so back) and that it would affect her credit if she didn't pay it so she couldn't pay us the $150 because she had to pay this bill first. I understand, and I don't need the money right away. I just feel like she is using this as a way to postpone payment and then not pay at all. 


Should I let her pay us the $150 in her own time? Am I being unreasonable for even asking her to? Is it even worth it to continue living with her when we have all of these issues after only 2 months? She has gotten extremely angry and decided to stop talking to me. How should I go about this?

We have been ""together"" for around 8 months now, we dont see much of each other because she is busy so much (she has a kid and a very busy job).  She said I was her boyfriend fairly early on but we havent seen much of each other so Ive never really felt it.

So basically in 8 months ive seen her twice.  I think you can see why I never really felt it.

Anyway the question: earlier today we were talking about this kind of thing and she doesnt think its fair to me to ""have"" to wait even though I said im okay with that.  

She suggested having a ""break"" and thats something Ive never encountered before.  I went along with it because I striaght out told her that if she wanted to end it I would respect her choice and I meant that, I really have a lot of respect for her intelligence.

I get what it means, she wants to be apart for a month or two (her words) and then see how we feel, but given how we almost never see each other this seems more to me like a break up than anything.  Am I wrong in thinking that?

We've been friends for a couple years now, and we just started dating a few months ago. We have very similar interests, life goals, aspirations, and are in the same professional field. I was initially attracted to his kindness for others, as well as his intellect and self-discipline. 

So far the reactions that we get when we go out to social events or just walk around town in general have been sort of...negative. I'm a reasonably attractive white girl with fairly balanced social skills. I don't have trouble striking up a conversation with anyone, though I prefer to stay at home rather than go to parties. 

He spent most of his youth alone on the internet, and as such hasn't really developed any social intuition. He talks too quickly for too long even after the other person has clearly lost interest, and has sort of a strange gasping laugh which tends to startle people. On top of this his looks tend to fall a bit short- he dresses well but he needs braces and has a slight limp. He is also of Indian descent, and I know the interracial aspect may be causing the bulk of the stares.

I care about him a lot and when it's just the two of us we are very happy. The sex is good, and we have plenty of chemistry. When he's around me the nervousness melts away and he acts a lot more naturally. When we go out to a party though, or just interact with sales people, I see the looks and it makes me feel embarrassed for both of us. Some people are outright rude to him, ignore him, talk over him, or just stare at me blankly like they're waiting for an explanation (white guys being the worst offenders). We have a mutual group of friends who support the relationship, but don't get to see them that much.

I know I shouldn't care about what other people think, but the negative feedback is starting to get to me. Like it or not, at the end of the day we are all social animals, and the disapproval stings. What can I do? He's focused on self improvement, and he knows that he isn't that smooth socially. He's been watching TV shows and listening to more music in an attempt to find things to relate to people on, and working on his appearance as well. It crushes me to see him get rejected when he's trying so hard to fit in.

Most of the feelings Ive built up for her in this time stem from the fact I belived (one time I told her about my relationships and virginity and when I asked her about hers she said same story) that she was also a virgin.

Yesterday she told me that more than a year ago (befor we even met) she went with some guy back to his appartment, (even tho she knew he had a grilfriend that she even met once) and had sex with him. When I ask her why she did this, she says it means nothing, and that she did it more as an experiment, because she didnt belive he would go trough with it, having a girlfriend and all ...

I dont really know if I can explain this, but I feel betrayed. She says that she has to mean more to me than just her virginity. I know that I cant really hold things that happened in our seperate pasts against her, but suddenly she just feels so medicore to me. The person I fell in love with, I didnt expect this from.

We go on trips, go hiking, climbing, running, read books, go on adventures... we've become great friends. I guess in my naivete, I thought that was what a relationship was, a wonderful friendship with the added bonus of sex. 

At the beginning of our relationship, I never really  thought it would get this far. I never intended to have sex with him, just have a little fun and move on. But we had so much in common outside of it, and we conveniently live right next to each other so we were together every day. I didn't intend on losing my virginity to someone until I thought I really cared about them, but I did and I thought he really cared about me. We had sex for the first time 3 weeks ago and it was great! 

About a week ago, I noticed he was acting funny. He's always been reserved about his feelings but I thought we had an unspoken understanding that we were together and that we cared for each other, so I never pushed for verbalizing it. I just wanted things to progress naturally. However, he was acting distant and strange, so last night I decided it was time we have a real sit down talk. 

That talk was where I found out I built up way more out of this than there actually was. He's not shy about his feelings or reserved or whatever, he just doesn't have them. He said I just don't think of you as someone I could be in a real relationship with. You're my climbing and hiking buddy and my... fun buddy. 

And that's all he had to say about it. It nearly tore me in half. All this time I thought we had some great thing going on. I was really starting to like him. And now I regret everything and I feel so delusional and naive and stupid. I just wish he would have told me a long time ago that he didn't see a future with me... well he kind of did, I just didn't really listen or pick up on it. I would have done anything for that boy. I was so head over heels. So stupid. 

Please reddit, I just need some comfort. I know we weren't together long and there's been much worse heartbreaks on here... but i just feel like that stereotypical 18 year old girl that falls for the guy who barely even cares about her.

Is a relationship salvageable once you feel you have been disrespected and shamed of yourself by the other party? What is there to do when you struggle to keep loving and trusting the other person?

Bit of backstory I can offer -- my partner has done something while we had sex that I didn't want him doing, and more than once. I first thought that once or twice were just innocent mistakes. But time went on and it didn't feel right. I felt anxious, uncomfortable, and horrible.

So I finally gathered up my courage to confront him what he did wrong. He apologized and promised he will fix it from now on...

but as he was talking to me, I felt he was just saying sorry to just patch and gloss things over so that I can stop being angry and ""bitching"" at him and he can move on with his life. He did not say this outright himself, but I sensed it when he said repeatedly he was unhappy and angry that I ""was making him feel demeaning...undeserved...like a dog"" about apologizing, explaining, reassuring.

While it is true that I was angry and was not at my best manners, I had not flown into some psychotic rage, resorted to physical abuses, and I have not asked him something so ludicrous and insulting in order to remedy what he had done. I just wanted to know why he failed to do something and hear his apology. 

Fixing the situation was a secondary concern to me. But it seems like that's his only concern.

It also makes me feel bad, HE makes me feel bad and ashamed about myself when I was trying to stand up for myself and what I thought was important to me regarding sex in a relationship but it feels like he ends up guilting me.

Is this some ego thing (on his part)?

27335,Non-Romantic,2ebp61,"I'm a 24 year-old woman with divorced parents, and I haven't spoken to my father (Dave) since January. The last words he ever said were, You don't have to ever contact me again. I hope you're happy, I'm out of your life. This is what he texted me, because he couldn't be bothered to call me on the phone.


The last conversation I had with my mom, (Deanna) I was bummed out about my boyfriend. Tried to confide in her, and she simply went on and on about how she's so in love with her new fiancee, Lisa. How they're so happy, so in love and she loves Lisa's 2 year-old daughter. Isn't Lisa's daughter perfect? Isn't she beautiful? She's my new sister, (I'm an only child) do I know that?


I hung up on her.


My dad and I have always had our issues. I was an *unplanned blessing* when my mom was 19, and my dad in his mid-20's. Deanna has told me stories of Dave hitting her with me in her arms. Or, how he threatened to take me away from her, and simply drop the subject when she'd call his bluff and hand me over.


Before, during, and even after the divorce, I was always a weapon to Dave. Sometimes it felt like Deanna did the same, keeping custody of me until I was 18, even though I moved in with Dave at 13. They would always put me in the middle, forcing me to choose between them. 


Dave got married when I was about 14/15. Instantly, New Wife was his everything. 


We had to go to church because New Wife was Lutheran, despite my dad being Atheist for much of his life. 


New Wife had pets, and even though Dave hated animals, he suddenly loved her spoiled, annoying dogs. 


She was one of those, These are my kids people. No offense to those who love their pets, but she took it to *extremes.* They would whine if they couldn't be in the same room as her, and would whine at their bedroom door ALL NIGHT LONG. Guess who had the ground-floor bedroom? Guess who slept upstairs, at the top of a long hallway and didn't have to listen to it?


New Wife is a cigarette smoker, and a drinker. My dad is a recovering alcoholic who hates cigarettes, and I have asthma. But, New Wife can smoke in the house, and so can her entirely family!


New Wife and her dogs became my dad's life. He would do nothing but post pictures on MySpace of her dogs, and soon I fell to the wayside. When her old dogs died, he bought her a new one, and that soon became the /u/Kahluka replacement.


Seriously, my dad would post about 5-10 pictures a day of the dog. He still does it, according to my cousin. He even made the dog a Facebook page, so he could post even more pictures. My mom started asking why the dog is his daughter, as that's what he would call her. He even changed his relationships on Facebook to list the dog as his kid.


So, I told him how I felt. We sat down, had some lunch. Said things would get better.


Months later, nothing has happened. I try to call, and he never answers. Text him and tell him I'm done being his kid if he doesn't want to be my dad. Long argument later, he sends me that fateful text.


My mom is a different story. She never dated when I was young, and until recently she never talked about anyone like this. At first, I was truly happy for her. Lisa is only a few years older than myself, and she hasn't come out of the closet yet, (She admits to close friends to being bi-sexual, but that's about it. To her parents, my mom is her roommate.) but she makes my mom happy. They're been together for *barely* a year, and they're already engaged.


My mom lives states and states away, but I finally got to see her after two long years this spring. She brought out Lisa and her 2 year-old, along with my grandma. I dragged along Boyfriend, who got to meet her for the first time.


Every conversation turned to Lisa. Isn't she beautiful? Isn't she amazing? I'm so happy, 'Luka. I really am. Isn't her daughter amazing? She's your new sister. Lisa's going to be like a mom to you, isn't she beautiful?


Seriously, if it wasn't about Lisa, it was about her daughter. I'd try to talk to her about something, ANYTHING, and it would all turn into, Isn't she *beautiful?*


I couldn't talk to her about my old home state, or how my life is going. I couldn't get through to her to talk about how she is, or when will she quit smoking? How about quitting drinking? Oh, Lisa's beautiful? Sure. Yeah.


Boyfriend pointed this out not too long ago. He told me that if we ever broke up, he would be afraid of what would happen to me. He told me he didn't really think anyone gave a shit about me. (Believe it or not, he said this in the nicest way possible.)


He pointed out that my mom wanted nothing to do with me, just Lisa. Did Lisa want something? Where did she want to go? Isn't she beautiful? (Seriously, every other sentence was that.)


I tried talking to her two days ago about the Boyfriend. Said I was sad, and she spouted off about Lisa. The incredible, amazing Lisa with an amazing daughter who is now also her daughter. She can do no wrong, she's never done any wrong. She can't believe she got so lucky. They set a date, did she tell me that? (She's told me nearly every conversation.)

There have been plenty of fights and ups and downs in this relationship. I'd like to think we fell in love very quickly and it became a serious relationship fast. 


She just graduated and is moving back home for a year before going to grad school. I don't even live in our home town anymore so I will still be seeing her on the weekends but more often. I still have 1 more year of undergrad to do. 


I have been feeling plenty of anxiety about the future of our relationship and how we're going to make it work. Most of our fights stemmed from the distance and from when I was going to drive up to see her next. So now I'm thinking she's going to expect to see me more because my commute to see her would be shorter. Also I know she's expecting us to move in together after I finish my undergrad, which I'm not sure about. I know there will be more fights ahead.


I was thinking that maybe this relationship will work a lot better if it is a little more casual. Like no mention of the future or moving in together whatsoever. I don't just want sex because I know we need each other emotionally too. But we are so deep into a serious relationship that I don't know if this can be converted back. Is this possible or just a whimsical fantasy?

55998,Relationships,1lgrg5,"I know there will be a lot of people telling me it was wrong of me to pursue another relationship while I had strong feelings for a close friend.  In my defense, I never intended on acting on those feelings.  I valued our friendship more than anything and I was not willing to risk it.  

For simplicity's sake, we'll call my best friend Dan and we'll call my ex-boyfriend Ryan.  Dan and I have been friends since high school.  We dated on-and-off and he gradually became my closest friend.  We ended things for good when we went to college.  Distance was only going to cause jealousy and insecurity (which we both didn't want) and we agreed to stay on good terms and remain friends.  We're still very close.  He's very attractive, funny, smart, and is an incredibly compassionate person.  There are so many things I can tell him that I can't tell Ryan.  Dan understands me better than anyone else.

Ryan and I met through a mutual friend.  I wasn't terribly interested at first, but he was persistent and succeeded in wooing me.  Ryan was very uncomfortable with how close Dan and I were.  It got to a point where Ryan told me it was affecting our relationship.  So, I began subtly cutting down my time with Dan.  It was really hard and I found myself comparing them in my head multiple times.  I know this is a terrible thing to do and it's completely unfair to him but Dan came out on top in every way.  I longed for Dan.  I began to miss him and I even considered meeting him secretly behind Ryan's back.  I hate infidelity.  I think it's disgusting and reserved for very malicious people but I'm very afraid that I've been emotionally cheating on Ryan.

When I found out Dan was moving away, I broke up with Ryan.  Again, I know this isn't fair to him but I think I was only with him because I couldn't be with Dan.  I realized that I didn't want Dan to leave and I was prepared to ask him to stay for me or let me go with him.  Then I talked to his younger brother who admitted to me that Dan had been in love with me for a long time but he didn't have the courage to tell me.

I have a couple questions regarding how I should approach this situation.

* Should I tell Ryan why I broke up with him?  I feel like I owe him a real reason but I don't want to hurt him unnecessarily.  I'm not in love with him but I do care about him.

* What the hell do I say to Dan?  His brother told me I'm not allowed to tell Dan I know because he's the only person Dan has confided this information too.

We see each other almost every single weekend, but it is usually broken up by myself having to work the overnight shift.  Whatever time we do spend together, we talk about everything.  We have almost identical goals and taste in music/movies/life...but the exact opposite political views.


Also, I must admit...that my girlfriend is a virgin. As someone who has been intimidate in all my past relationships I find it very hard to be with someone where that element is not there.  She has said she is now ready, but I've heard from countless people that girls are crazy to whoever they give their virginity too. (Not sure if true, I have never been in this scenario before.)

46008,Relationships,1jdbp8,"Title should read insecurity instead of jealousy.

Hello, I'm here to seek advice on how to healthily stop being a insecure woman. Since I can remember I have always had a jealous/insecure streak, not a nasty one, but one that would leave me feeling like the one who is never good enough. And this also happens outside of intimate relationships, it occurs in my job, it occurs in university. 


I am currently with my boyfriend (28) of about half a year and all our fights as of late result from me being insecure/jealous. We all 'look' at other people while in relationships even if we don't act on it. He does this, I do it. But I cannot stand the feeling when I know he looks at another woman. It hurts me so much to the point where I feel physically ill. This isn't healthy, and he has picked up on it. He tells me I have nothing to worry about, and I don't. we are so open and honest with each other, but my jealousy/insecurity issue (when there is no need to have one) is strangling and suffocating our relationship to the point where we fight almost every day. 

I look at men and appreciate their good looks, this does not take from the fact I love my partner, nor does it mean I want to leave or cheat on him. When he appreciates another woman it is the exact same as me. So why does it make me want to vomit? Why can't I accept that it means fuck all and is no reflection on me? Are there steps I can take to stop myself from being this way, because apart from driving him nuts, I'm driving myself nuts. 

**TLDR** I am a jealous/insecure woman, who thinks she is not good enough. I get insecure/jealous to the point where I physically feel sick when there is no need to. Is there steps, or some contructive or progressive way I can deal with this level of jealousy? Please note, my jealousy is not nasty, I just take things really really personally.

We talked quite a bit, and I somehow managed to ask her out on a date at the end of March. For all of April, things were going pretty well I would say. We hung out a lot, alone and stuff, and I even got to meet her parents. I was trying to take things slow, and I'm the kind of guy who really wants to push things. Always afraid I would scare her off. Anyway, at the end of April, I was leaving the country for all of May. I told her that I had feelings for her, and that I would like to see how things go when I get back in June. She also told me that she liked me as well. Throughout June, I managed to call her 5 times in that month. I even mailed her a card that I made. She sounded so excited to talk to me for the first four calls, but there was something off when I called her the fifth..


When I got back, I was so excited to see her, DYING to see her, it was a beautiful day and I suggested we go have a picnic after she was done work. She declined and said that she was only available for half an hour during her lunch break. She seemed really different when I saw her again, even her texts sounded different, as we would talk a lot before I left. She didn't once ask me about my trip, and after 15 minutes or so, I finally asked her what she thought about all of this. About us. She seemed relieved that I asked, and told me that she really doesn't feel like she wants to be in a committed relationship, and apoligised. She explained that she has a lot coming up, and doesn't have the time and wants to focus on school. It sounds pretty legit, but I wonder if the response would have been different if I stayed... She said that she just wants to be friends. I acted pretty cool about it, and said it was no big deal. As calm as I was in that situation, the rejection hurt. I invested so much of my heart into this, just to have it thrown back at me when I was so excited to see her again. It's been two weeks now, but it still hurts a bit. 


I kind of got over the rejection part, but that's not what bugs me. I just down right miss her, a lot. I feel like the last three months was pointless.

A couple of months ago I met some friends of hers, which included an ex from 10 years ago that she's still friends with.  He's a very fit and good looking guy, and they obviously were physically attracted to each other then, and presumably still would be now.

I'm going away for a couple of weeks, and she's said she'd like to get a holiday in at the same time.  If I'm away, she might as well be as well.  Her suggestion?  A skiing trip with her ex.  She asked if I'm ok with it, and said that she won't go if I'm not.

Now shortly after meeting this guy I had quite a frank conversation where I said that I don't think I'm the jealous type, and I trust her completely regarding her more recent exes, but that if one day we had a big argument, and she went running to this guy (as a friend) I'd very definitely be worried.

So yeah, it's great that she's asked, but given that I've singled him out as the one guy that I might worry about in the future, why would she even suggest it?!

He has a current girlfriend of a year or two, but has a long history of cheating on her, and others, so that doesn't fill me with confidence...

This last March my ex(23 y/o) found out I was living with my new bf, became insane with anger, and decided to try and break us apart by telling everyone he could that I was cheating on my boyfriend with my ex. 1. My ex lives two hours away, 2. I'm with my bf 24/7, 3. When I cut someone from my life, they stay cut.
How am I supposed to cheat? Besides, I'm one of those ""you don't wanna be with someone, don't be with them.""

At first my bf was upset and questioned me about it, and I was upset because MY ex brought my BF's ex(17 y/o) into the situation and she /actually/ cheated on my bf when she was with him. Now, me ""cheating"" never happened and none of them have proof it did, but it did hurt our relationship. We bounded back though.

And now, two nights ago, my bf's old ""best friend"" (who we'll call Rose and is 19 y/o) decided to message him out of the blue and make fun of me and talk major shit about me. She was trying to get a rise out of him because she wanted him angry at me, because SHE'S angry at me for ""cheating on her best friend"" (who she heard all this from HER best friend who just so happens to be my bf's ex) and being stuck up his ass all the time. I'll admit, I have been like that. I've never been clingy though. But my boyfriend is also a real douche nozzle when it comes to me wanting a hug in public or a quick secret peck. Too much PDA for him apparently.

But I'm upset. My bf not only didn't stick up for me, but he let Rose continue to laugh at me and talk shit. He said everyone is entitled to an opinion, and I agree, but in no way is this right. And he won't get that through his head! Whereas I fly off the handle if ANYONE says anything bad about him to me, or at all. He's seen me do it. Rose is not his best friend. She was never there for him, she is still best friends with the girl who hurt him deeply and caused trust issues for him, she decided to just not talk to him and then pop up randomly to pick on me, and even said mean things to me..

This all upsets me for another reason. He established a rule in our relationship: outsiders do not need to know what goes on in our relationship (because we HATE when people interfere.) Rose is an outsider.

But now, after talking about it with my bf and sort of fixing things, I'm still upset. He broke my trust (because my ex constantly did this stuff to me), he broke the rule HE put down for us, and what's worse is I know he's lying to me about still talking to her and sticking up for me. He didn't right his wrongs. I know he doesn't like confrontation, but this is bullshit. And now he's broken one of the two things we built our relationship: not lying.

She's 25, a tall blonde, beautiful, smart, funny person, speaks several languages, proud of her culture, everything that would make her my absolute dream girl. Of course, there are flaws.

Before we started hanging out, she was an escort. I have no problem with her past, she's left it, but I'm still scared she might go back to it. She's talked about it and still talks to some girls who work, though she always quickly talks herself out of it.

Then, about a week after we started really hanging out, she hopped in my car and started crying. She always talked shit about a girl she knew because she was a junkie, but now she broke down and told me that she was a junkie, too. Smoked fentanyl patches. She was starting treatment for it, going on suboxone, and she's been on it for a month now. She's going to the clinic daily, but has had her dosage upped already.

I've lent her money, and she's usually quick to repay, though sometimes it takes a little longer. I'll give her credit, she does give the money back, though she's been borrowing it from her parents with whom she moved back in with. I feel bad for them, that their money is going to me, but at least I'm being repaid. I'm just scared of where her money is going. She's always meeting up with people to buy weed (or sometimes suboxone) but she's never willing to show me what she bought. I've been suspicious, but I try to stay quiet about it, trying to believe what she says.

We just really spent our first real weekend together. Cooking together, going swimming in the pool, watching movies and TV, just hanging out and making out. I haven't pushed for sex because I know the type of work she just got out of and it hurts her to think about what she did.

She has an appointment on Wednesday with a rehab centre.

The rehab centre is for women, but it's scary that it's so close to home because it'd be easy for her to just up and leave.

I'm scared of a few things. I'm scared that if I keep trying to play the hero, I'm going to fail eventually. I'm scared that in rehab she'll straighten out and not need me anymore. Part of me doesn't want her to go.

I've been thinking about breaking it off with her, and I'm worried it would make me a bad person. I want her to do better, but I don't know if I want to be around that. I'm scared that I care about her too much. It's just so much stress to deal with her. She's scared I'm going to leave and she'll be left with no one. I'm scared if I leave she'll go back to her old habits.

84188,Relationships,31pg7n,"I've dated Courtney for about three years and have been engaged for about 3 months.

I set up a very romantic show boat proposal on New Year's Eve that I knew she'd love and she was ecstatic.

However, ever since she has said Yes! she's become a completely different person. She's nasty, petulant, shallow and rude.

I'm appalled at the way she is treating her parents. I thought we'd have a small but nice wedding we'd pay for ourselves. She wants something rivaling a debutante ball and expects her parents to bankroll the whole thing. They are approaching retirement and they were gracious enough to say they'd help with expenses but Courtney keeps making more and more outrageous and expensive demands that I am positive will really set her parents back.

She treats me horribly, she wants to talk weddings all the time and while I wouldn't mind that, would even be excited to help plan the wedding, any time I disagree or have a different opinion she blows up at me.

She wants things completely different than I do, everything from the venue, to the colors, the menu, the band...everything is a fight. I wouldn't mind giving her mostly what she wants but I'm mainly concerned about finances because everything she wants costs major $$$. And frankly, it's my wedding too and I would like just a slight personal touch to mark the occassion. I thought maybe I could pick the cake or one of the colors or something. Nothing big, just a small contribution of my own.

Hell no. She flipped out. I endured a two hour tantrum over a motherfu-ing CAKE for Christ sake, and how it's HER day and she's been dreaming of it since she was a little girl blah blah blah. I don't yell or scream at her, I usually just try to reason with her quietly but that only pisses her off more. Now I'm just staying quiet or leaving the room but that STILL pisses her off and she follows me around the apartment so I'm forced to listen to her whining.

And that's just ONE example

I am so sick of her attitude and treatment of everyone I am ready to end the engagement. I don't know where the woman I fell in love with went, because Courtney has never acted like this before, but she's been replaced by this complete bitch I'm starting to hate.

My friends and family are telling me it's just wedding planning stress and she'll go back to normal once the wedding is over with but I don't think that's an excuse to act like a spoiled selfish jerk who makes everyone miserable and treats her parents like they are an ATM instead of human beings who are getting on in years and deserve respect and consideration.

There's a part of me that feels sad to throw away 3 years of bliss with a wonderful woman but that woman is GONE. I want out. I'm not going to shackle myself for life to a horrible person who treats other people beneath her for a damn PARTY. I am completely disgusted with her and her attitude.

Should I end this nonsense or give it one more try? Is this who Courtney REALLY is (seems weird she'd flip a switch suddenly after 3 years of a blip free radar) or is she just being a typical bride? How do I even go about fixing it? Or should I run fast and far?
How do I break an engagement if it comes down to that?

The wedding is in 6 months if that makes a difference.

**TL;DR Wonderful gf of 3 years becomes bridezilla from hell after getting engaged. I'm ready to end the engagement but everyone says this is normal bride behavior and she'll go back to normal after the wedding. Is it worth saving and how do I fix it if it is?

The thing is, when we were newly a couple, he brought up and we discussed the fact that we both want kids and to be married someday. I wasn't anywhere near ready for kids or a husband at the time(I was 18 at the time and he's 15yrs older than me-yeah I know I know I heard the lecture a billion times lol). But I told him those are in fact things I want someday, but I wanted to finish college first. He seemed satisfied with my answer. 

Forward to today- I'm almost 23 and just graduated from college last may. He still gives me butterflies when he looks at me and smiles the smile that's just for me. I love this man and want to spend my life with him and have a family... But even though I'm done with school and will be working in my field, he shows no signs of wanting anything to change our relationship like we talked about. 

I don't want to rush him but I feel shitty everytime I see someone's posts about marriage even though I'm happy for my friends. I feel shitty for being jealous and feel guilty.

We talk a ton including via phone call over the next 2 days and plan to meet last night. Through our texts she was super flirty and it was pretty obvious she likes me a lot. Here are some things she said to me ""I want your babies."" ""We would make really pretty babies."" ""I love giving blow jobs"" ""I want your balls in my mouth."" ""I just want to cuddle with you on our date."" And we even exchanged sexts...

 So we meet up friday at her house she didn't even want to go out. She wanted me to come straight up to her house, with beer. She order pizza. I get there give her a big hug, but then she proceeds to sit in her recliner in her living room for the next 2 hours completely focused on a netflix show (Revenge its not even good). Meanwhile I'm sitting on her couch playing with her cats trying to talk to her and she is just sitting there watching the damn show. I try to get her to come sit next to me and she's like ""No I like my chair."" Then I'm like ""What if I just grab you and bring you too me?"" ""Well that would make me mad!"" So we proceed to watch 3 hours of this god awful show then she tells me she is going to bed. 

So I ask her well does that mean you want me to go to bed? ""Um, well I'm going to bed so yeah."" And then I'm like ""what gives? I literally couldn't wait to see you all day, and you have been super stand offish since I got here."" (And frankly a bitch I didn't say that) She's like ""Your trying to hard..."" And I'm like ""Ok, i'll stop and leave. I really like you though and want to see you again."" She: ""Well I have my interview next week and school every night so I'll have to get back to you."" We then walk to her door, and we hug and I leave.

But this is the first one were I legitimately got rejected. I really like her, she is like the perfect situation for me and an upgrade from my ex. Uh, I am just wondering if she is naturally awkward in person or she didn't like me.

I work and live at home to support my parents. She lives in her own place and goes to college. I spend 3-4 days out of the week staying at her place. She texts me saying she misses me after I leave her for about an hour. She gets upset when I decide to stay at home for some nights.

Yesterday she got very upset at me for not calling her most of the day, I was at work and wasn't able to call nor did I have service in the building I was working in. Also she got even more mad at me for not calling her and letting her know I was staying at home last night as soon as I got home.

This escalated into a 3 hr conversation of her discontent of how I need space and how she tries to give me space all the time. As much as I like having her as a girlfriend, I also love to be alone sometimes. Usually when these arguments happen I am on the receiving end because she gets very emotional and doesn't listen to what I have to say so I usually just let her vent and I listen.

I'll make this brief. We were together for 1.5 years, broke up due to trust issues and many fights. 
A few days after the break up he kept wanting to get back together, I told him we need the time apart and that I think he has issues with the need to sleep with other girls. He said he's not interested in that at the moment and that we'll decide later. 

The next day I told him I need a final definition on whether we're a break (not sleeping with others) or breaking up. Told him I'm not into others, but I need to know where we stand. 
He got pissed at me out of the fucking blue. Told me we'll talk tomorrow. Didn't call the next day. I tried to talk to him the day after that, he said he'd rather break up, and that he didn't sleep with anyone. 

Except, he did. I need all the help I can get not to call him and yell at him for all of eternity, for manipulating me into waiting while he goes out and fucks other girls, and for lying to me, AGAIN.

156253,Relationships,1i0nzm,"Here's some background:
I [30M] have been married to my wife [30F] for almost a year; we were dating for about a year before we got married and we have a 6 month old.

I work full time, she is a stay-at-home mom
Last night, she was upset with me because I wanted to work out.  I've told her a million times I need to exercise because I feel like a fatass, and she says, ""well your wife is sitting here getting fat and all you want to do is work out.""  I wanted to tell her, ""well do something about it then"" but all that would've led to is her being upset about the fact that she has to take care of our son, clean the house, etc. all day long.  I help take care of him when I get home, I make formula, I clean up after dinner (most times), I help make dinner (some times) and I generally do what I can to contribute, although it may not be enough in her mind.


So, she often mad at me because she feels that my going to work is a ""break"" from family life.  I tell her I wish I could be a stay at home dad, that I wish I could spend time with my son instead of being at some worthless job... but that doesn't ever matter.  She is constantly having trust issues with me because I lied to her about going to a strip club at my bachelor party.  I also lied to her about smoking a cigarette after we both quit; when I finally admitted it to her, she now holds both of these against me claiming ""she doesn't have anything else to go off of.""  I tell her that's because I haven't given her anything, but that is apparently enough.  She constantly worries that I'm going to cheat on her or that I already have, because I have a... colorful past with girls.  I tell her she's the one I married, she's the one I had a child with, and the one I'm living my life for, but that doesn't matter.  At least twice a week she worries; checks my breath for cigarette smoke, comment on my cologne and ask if it's some other woman.  This gets on my nerves.  She also is constantly unhappy about the fact that she wakes up in the middle of the night to feed our 6moold.  I offer to help occasionally, and usually do the night feeding (9-10PM) so she can go to bed early; she usually never does and ends up waking up between 1-3AM to feed him again.  She is resentful that I get to sleep, but I have to be alert for my job, or we wouldn't be able to afford our new house, two cars, etc.   This morning, I woke up and she was mad because our son was waking up.  I tried to cuddle with me to which she said, ""DON'T TOUCH ME, I'M SO MAD!  I'M JUST TIRED, I JUST WANT TO SLEEP!  YOU'RE JUST LAYING THERE ALL SNUGGLED UP AND I HAVE TO WAKE UP.""  I try to help her with the late feedings over the weekends, but now I feel guilty for sleeping or going to work because she's ""stuck at home.""  After this morning, I sent her the following email:


*This morning you told me, ""don't touch me.  I'm so mad at you.""  I understand that you didn't get sleep, and I'm sorry.  I didn't sleep very well either - didn't get to bed until about midnight.  But making me feel GUILTY about sleeping isn't OK.  Being mad at me for sleeping is not OK.  


Please consider that the only reason I even do sleep, and don't help you every night, is so that I can go to an unfulfilling job, to do unfulfilling things, so that I can support my wife and son.  I constantly feel guilty about going to work, and about going to sleep, because you always tell me how miserable you are at home all day and without sleep.


Baby, I don't tell you how miserable I am at work every day; even if I do, I especially don't get MAD at your or make you feel GUILTY for staying with our son all day when I have to go to some shit job.  What if I actually DID enjoy my job?  I would feel even more guilty for doing something I enjoy because YOU don't enjoy being home with our son all day - or at least that's how it seems because you're constantly stressed about it.  It seems that you're jealous that I get to go to work and sleep; but then if you were working, I bet you'd be upset that I got to stay at home all day even if I didn't sleep.  It feels like that's a lose-lose.  


When you get mad at me for these things, please try and see it from my perspective:  at least you get to watch our son grow up, and give him the love and affection that he needs, and help him learn how to become a thriving baby boy.  I WISH I could be there every day with him, but I can't because I have to be here instead, making sure that our bills are paid and that my family has a roof over its head and food on the table.


You say that you appreciate that, and I believe you.  But then you go around and get mad at me, like yesterday, and tell me that I don't participate enough; that when I'm around, I'm fine, but that I need to be around more often.  Well, what if I get another job in the tech center?  What if I have to be gone even longer than I do now?  What if I had taken the consulting gig?  How would you survive?  You're guilt tripping me about doing what I need to do to make sure that the basic needs of our family can get taken care of.


If it's really stressing you out that much, let's get you back to a job and get daycare for [our son] -- yeah, most of your funds would go to that, but you'd have an extra $300-$400 left over, and then we could switch off which nights we stay up with [our son].  If this isn't something you're interested in, that's fine -- I'm not forcing it on you, it's just a suggestion.


Regardless of whether you want to do that or not, know that just as I have to do these unfortunate things every day, like going to work, you also have to deal with the unfortunate aspects of life every day too.  Babies are fussy, they have a tough time sleeping, and they are a full time job.  That's just the reality of our life. 


You have been fighting this fight with sleep for MONTHS now.  There has not been a single day that being tired, being exhausted, or not sleeping has NOT affected you (and therefore me) negatively probably since before [our son] was born.  I feel like there are very few days where we just have a good day, where we don't bicker about something or other.  


You say you ""just want to be"" - and I don't know how to tell you that's just not going to happen.  We are living the hardest life we could possibly live and we are hanging on by the skin of our teeth.  We chose to have [our son], get married, temporarily move to a different state, buy a house, and look for better paying jobs.  There will always be decisions and challenges - life will never be smooth sailing, but when we work hard towards something, we can reward ourselves too.  I need you to accept that.  


You still get sad about our previous life; you always get melancholy about ""how our weekends have changed.""  Stop living in the past.  You still bring up my bachelor party and the fact that I smoked a cigarette 4 months ago.  You CANNOT HANG ON TO THESE THINGS.  It feels like any time I make a mistake, I'm never going to live it down, and in a relationship, that's a really terrible feeling to feel.  Forgive and forget is something I live by, not only because I want to, but because I don't have the time or the energy to waste on anger and judgment.  I want to instill this in our son, too - but that means YOU have to live by it too, especially when it comes to those you love dearly.


You laugh at me when I say, ""get some rest.""  Honestly, this entire email is due to the fact that you have an inordinate amount of stress on you, and your ability to handle that stress.  However, when you ACTIVELY decide not to rest, here's the message you're sending me:


""I constantly feel like shit because I don't get enough sleep to feel normal.  However, when you tell me to get sleep, I choose cleaning the house, packing, and doing other things over resting because those things are more important to me than our rest.  I know that me not getting rest is putting a strain on our relationship, but these other things are more important to me than remedying the one thing that can help me solve some of my problems.


I'm doing everything I can to make us work as a family, as a relationship... but I can't continue with this fighting every day, feeling like there are all of these unscalable obstabacles in our way that we can do nothing about.  You know what?  We had a son - we can't change that.  We can't go back to living like we were.  We can't go back to sleeping normal hours, or quitting a job because we don't like it.  We can't go back to anything that we were, so we now have to embrace what we are, and not constantly fight it.  You continue to fight over sleep, but you refuse to acknowledge the solutions - either accept that sleep will continue to elude you, or find a way to get sleep. 


I love you so much, and I love our family so much, but it feels like we have more bad days than good days, and I can't handle that.  It's been way too long since we've just had a good day, from start to finish, without having a fight about something.  I'm over that.  I know we're capable of a better relationship than this, and I don't know what we need to do, but I know we need to do something.


WE HAVE TO LIVE TODAY FOR TOMORROW, NOT BECAUSE OF YESTERDAY.  


I am asking my parents for a couple of hundred dollars so that we can go see a therapist (no, I won't tell them that's what it's for).  I'm going to find one and set up an appointment.  I can't continue on like this and I know you can't either - and I'm not ready to give up.  So, I'm putting my foot down and getting us some help.


I love you.*


Now her response to that was, ""I'm sorry I'm such a shitty person."" and that's that.  She always does this; always becomes a victim and says, ""oh yea, everything is my fault isn't it.  I do this, I do that...""   I do tell her things once in a while but I feel like she often has unrealistic expectations of people, even herself, and she beats herself and others up for the most inane things.  She has pushed away many of her friends and is now pushing me away too, I feel.

I have developed this crush on a friend of a friend, who is physically and personality wise everything I could hope for in a guy. He is funny, smart, outgoing and nice. However we have barely spoken and then it was in a group not one on one. 

Recently he invited me to his birthday party where we didn’t speak until I was telling him I was leaving. He sounded genuinely surprised and upset that I was leaving, which took me aback. And then he gave me a hug which really confused me (and yes I realize that it is not uncommon to hug people hello of goodbye I have not had anyone who I did not know well do this until recently). I should have asked for his number at this point, but once again he was surrounded by people and my shyness got the better of me again.

I really want to get to know him better, I know from one of our mutual friends that we share several interest (anime, video games certain shows ect.).

Also one of his friends that I met once randomly informed me of his good qualities and that he was single recently, which makes me want to hope that he might be interested.

I think the easiest way to get over this is to become less shy, but that is much easier said then done.  :(

That feels so much better now that I have said it. 

Should I just message him and ask for his number or just start talking to him via FB since I have no idea when I will actually see him in person? Or is that too forward? How would you feel if a girl you barely knew started messaging you? Or is there a better way to approach this?

Hey /r/relationships!

So, I've been in a relationship for two years now. 

However, it's become a long distance relationship (internationally) around 3-4 months back with no actual confirmed date for when we are going to see each other again (we still talk over text daily, call occasionally etc.) which makes life somewhat shitty at times.


We were set up by a mutual friend at the time (their Mom's are friends and the friend who set us up is in my circle of friends but didn't have much to do with me at the time and she doesn't really have much to do with my GF either to be honest, they're not what I'd call close friends.)


The strange thing that is confusing me is this friend, we'll call her Susie.


About a month after my GF left for her home country, I got a call from Susie asking me how I was doing, catching up, etc, which isn't really strange other than the fact that she'd never called me before and I didn't know she even had my number, but we talked for 20 minutes or so and went on our ways.


But as of the last two months or so she's been wanting to hang out, go out for coffee, go out for drinks and that sort of thing. 


There was a time a week or so back where she was meeting with a guy who she was interested in and they went out for drinks together with just the two of them and she called me up to come and join (what) as she'd been talking about me and the guy asked her about me, apparently saying he wanted to meet me (a little strange...) 


When I got there, she kinda stopped talking to the dude, saying he actually wasn't interested in her and they were just friends. The both of them kinda just kept talking to me rather than each other, which I thought was weird.


I ended up dropping her back to her place that night and I felt kinda bad for the dude. If some girl called out another dude to come hang with us while we were on a date then went home with him, I'd be a little sad.


She's started asking me to help with certain things in her life and if we are all going somewhere, she'll call me to ask if she can catch a ride with me when she could easily ask one of the other girls in the group like she used to (one of the girls is her best friend, who drives and lives close by to her). Message contact has increased from almost nothing for 2 years to a really regular stream of messages between us.

TLDR at the top so you guys won't have to scroll: Emotionally distant exbf, objectively I do not want to get back together with him, but I'm still very emotionally attached to him and miss his company. How to move on?

I had a pretty rough breakup. In short, he was emotionally distant, terrible at communicating with me about our relationship problems, and prioritizes work above me. We haven't been together that long, but we had a great year together. We had similar interests and enjoyed many hours playing video games, watching tv, and we share some pretty fantastic esoteric jokes. But it was a very out-of-sight, out-of-mind situation with him - where he would just completely forget about me when I'm not physically with him - he wouldn't text me, call me, or make time for me. Sometimes he'd even ditch me in the middle of our conversations.

Now I can't sleep, I don't feel hungry, and I am having a really terrible time coping with the breakup. It's affecting my job performance. It breaks my heart that despite what I thought we shared (what I thought was special), he so willingly broke up with me when I suggested it. I see him daily since we're co-workers (yeah yeah I know it was a bad idea, but we were just so compatible at the time, I thought we would last) and it's really hard to move forward. We were such great friends before we started dating, and I think what hurts me the most is that I've lost that. I loved hanging out with him, and there's only a handful of people I can say that about. 

I've spoken to him a few times post-breakup, and he seems to have completely moved on. He is constantly going to parties, meeting up with friends, and filling his time. He doesn't miss me and he doesn't regret breaking up. I understand that the relationship wasn't going anywhere, I was unhappy, and we're probably both better off apart - so although logically I recognize that breaking up is for the better, I can't sort out my emotions. In fact I feel animosity towards him for being so goddamned happy. Like it was a one-sided relationship and I meant nothing to him. I try to talk to him about it, but like when we were dating, he either ignores me or stares at me awkwardly without saying anything. I don't understand what goes on in his mind, ever. How can someone be so cold? I can't get any closure from him.

I probably sound very immature. Based on everything I've said, I feel like it should be a simple matter of moving on with life. But how? I still have nightmares where I wake up feeling immense pain - like the type of pain and exhaustion you feel from crying for literally hours. This is ridiculous! I don't understand the hold he has on me! It's not like this is my first and/or longest relationship either, I've broken up with guys who I've been with for 5 years and it wasn't this bad (albeit, they either cheated on me or were abusive).

I need some words of wisdom or something. It's been a month and I thought that this would be a lot smoother. It's not like I can't occupy my time - I have a shit ton of things to do (my mind keeps gravitating back to him). How do I keep this from happening? How should/do I change my attitude towards this breakup?

76158,Breakups,1p9628,"If you've watched How I Met Your Mother, the exact same thing that happened to Marshall happened to me.

We've been together for 5 years. Married for 4. It was a wonderful 5 years and we were really happy together. This summer we started to lived apart as she started Med school and I found a job in the nearest city. It's a 4 hour drive. I visit her every other week (or even every week when she needed me to be). Long(ish) distance was not an issue. We had been through a lot together, created many wonderful memories. We had plans for the future and were on pursuit of those plans. Less than 2 weeks ago we were planning a trip to Montreal for the winter. She was my best friend and we were really close.

The breakup caught me off guard - resulted from a small fight that seemed like the kind we normally had. I could not wrap my head around what happened, because less than a month ago we were joking about her roommate's breakup and commented on the situation of the breakup season, refering to who is happening to the incoming first-year med student. (So apparently we did not escape the breakup season after all)

It was done over the phone. The initial fight was about a minute thing about her not texting me when she got home late. I was just worried and got upset that she forgot to do it. Then the conversation shifted to her feeling that I'm too controlling, to her wanting to be free, and eventually to her NEEDING to soul-search. 

This reminds me of what happened to Marshall in HIMYM when Lily left him. Since my SO could be dramatic sometimes, I was just upset and did not want to believe it. I apologized for the fight, I explained my controlling attitude, by phone, by text, by calling her. I wrote her an email about sweet things, hoping to remind her of the happiness we had together hope she change her mind about saying those breakup looming words.

So we talked the next day. Usually by this time she calms down and we make up. But not this time. The conversation began to be imbued by words like I don't want to be in a relationship, I don't feel about you that way anymore, despite my apologies, pleading, and proposing alternatives to breakup. I even proposed if she would consider us having a temporary break for a month or so, let time sort out her feelings and we can continue from there. But she doesn't want to be bogged down by a time table. She just wants her freedom, and insistent of breaking up the relationship. 

What she claimed was that she still cares about me, and want me around as a friend, and possible to end up with me in an indefinite future, but no more possible than she ending up with any other guys (or girls, since she's soul-searching.). This was her stance.

My thinking was, if she's grown weary of any ideas of us in the future. There is no point of me lingering. I explained to her that I cannot go from us coming from the exemplary couple among all our friends to becoming a friend, and not more. I told her that I must proceed to 
No Contact if she breaks up. It will hurt me to not be able to see her, hear her voice, tell her about my feelings. But I know time will heal and I'll forget about her. She understood this. I wished her the best. And that was it.

This is the second day after the breakup. I am visiting friends in another city this weekend just to get my mind off the trauma. I am having trouble sleeping. Just 3 days ago we were planning our Halloween customs. Now I've cut contact and she just disappears. I having thoughts as to whether I am too eager to begin the cleansing process and cutting contact. She was my whole life for the past 5 years and I don't know if I could've talked to her some more, convinced her some more, reminded her of us some more, and maybe salvage and fight for us some more. I am not afraid of letting go, it's just I don't know if I would regret it if I've let go too easily.

One thing that bothers me sometimes is that I have been purposefully vague about my past relationships and I don't know if I need to open up to him and tell him everything. We are both quiet, introverted people that don't necessarily share every minute detail, so it hasn't been a big deal. 


I was in an emotionally abusive relationship in the past, and had a couple of short-term relationships after that where I was still emotionally unstable. I did some things I am not proud of (breaking up by no contact with one guy, dated another controlling man and then kissed someone else so we would break up) when I was younger. However, I've matured and learned about healthy relationships. I've been in 1-2 healthy relationships before I met my current boyfriend. Most people who know me now don't know any of this, and I an genuinely happy and fulfilled in my personal and professional life. It's only when I sometimes think back to the past I sort of freeze up inside.


I have tried to see a couple of therapists (one after I ended the abusive relationship, and one a few years after that). But both of them stopped seeing me after a few sessions because I seemed pretty well-adjusted and was capable of dealing with the issues. I got some good advice about accepting myself and having healthy habits (exercise, eating well, sleeping well, etc.) to cope, but otherwise nothing major. The message I took away was that the past is in the past and I should work on the here and now. 


My question is, do I need to tell my current boyfriend the entire truth? He knows about the abusive relationship (not the details, just that I was in one) and that I was ""wild"" in my youth (but again, not specifically what). I am very happy in my current relationship, we are both supportive of each other, and this never comes up. Do I need to try therapy again even if this isn't really causing me any daily stress?

51600,Dating,1kx8cf,"So I work with a girl called S. She is pretty, funny, and I find her easy to talk to. I didn't see anything romantic happening with us, as she seemed pretty into another coworker named J. Since J and S were making out at parties, and generally being close I put out of my mind the idea of dating her. I just considered it a non-issue, and considered her as a fun friend, not necessarily dating material.  

That changed when she came to a party at my house. I ended up getting drunk, and so did she. She started kissing me and we had sex. I was into it, but I do remember thinking that we probably shouldn't given that she seemed so entwined with J.   

I woke up the next morning feeling guilty about it, and so did she to an extent. So we agreed to keep it under wraps and we did for the week. She still talked to J, and the two seemed flirty. Our entire work place thinks that the two are together and dating. So we talk on text and she reveals that she likes me, and I like her back.  

Here's the problem, I'm going into first year university next year, and she's going into second year. We would be living about 500km apart. I'm going into engineering, and she's in a similarly difficult course. I honestly don't think I would be a good boyfriend for her, as I would be absorbed in my studies, and sorting out my first year life. Basically I'm in no place for a long distance relationship.   

So I invite her over to my house and we talk, and I tell her what I told you. And it sucks, and she's disappointed about not being able to date me because she says she likes me a lot, and I can tell that she's upset because she doesn't think that I'm trying enough for her, but it's just how I feel. On top of that, I'm not sure if we would work out dating wise, since she has cheated before in other relationships (but with an abusive boyfriend and a week before breaking up with him) and she has a good deal of baggage (dead relatives, a friend, and medical problems), which I am totally not prepared to deal with, especially when my life is in flux.  

And though she was disappointed she understood what I meant and respected that if I wasn't totally into the relationship then it might not work out. So that is my first problem, as I feel bad making that decision for her, thinking it won't work out, but I think it's the best course. She's also a girl of mixed messages, as in she texted me earlier this week saying we should just be friends.  

Here's my other problem: she wanted to have sex one more time. We had been talking this over, and yes there had been kissing and cuddling. Then she says she wants to have sex one last time, as she is going to be going to J's cottage over the weekend, and if I didn't have sex with her she would just be thinking about me over the weekend since she likes me more than she likes him. To clarify, she's going to his cottage not because she's into him but because she's hesitant to hurt his feelings and doesn't want to say that she's not all too into him. She also said that it would make her feel better in general, and be like a closing between us. I didn't feel right doing it, and so I said no. She also asked if we could keep cuddling and kissing like we had been next week, after she had gone to J's cottage. I gave her the answer that I'm unsure, but I don't think we should. So she practically begged me to fuck her, but I still felt inside that it would only make the problem worse (of her liking me, and her guilt of stringing J on a little) and it took every bit of will to say no since she's so attractive and nice (and I remember last time being great).  

So here's my question. Did I do the right thing? What should I do? Should I have had sex with her? Would that have made her feel better? I kind of feel shitty about the whole thing, like I hurt her, though I think I did what was best for her in the long run, given that she seems so unsure of what she actually wants I took the decision into my hands.

My contact with that family occurred irregularly from when I was young to middle school when it stopped almost completely. Today, I received a message from a member of that family apologizing for not playing a big role in my life. The only reason I feel I was even thought about is because my recent accomplishments have been broadcast on Facebook by my family and extended family. My problem currently is I am in the process of changing my name from my mothers maiden name to my stepfather who has been around since I was very very young. However, I have never felt truly accepted by his family. I felt it was right to take my stepfathers name though due to his raising me. But something in that message from my family member stuck with me. He said my daddy would be proud of me. I never knew my biological father and I have only now begun to feel sadness that I didn't. I also feel sadness because my family is beginning to hold me on a pedestal due to recent accomplishments when I feel I can be a very immoral person at times, but not in regards to integrity or theft. I apologize for rambling, but I just don't know how to deal with these conflicting emotions right now. I guess my question is, is it wrong for me to change my name and my identity to that of my stepfathers when I feel his family has never accepted me of one of his own and it would show my biological fathers family that I do not care for his heritage even though they have not been in close contact in past years. And then to add on, I feel bad for changing from the name of my mothers father (maiden name) when he has been the relative I feel I am most like. At this crossroad in my life, I want to make the best decision that will make me and my whole family happy I suppose. I understand why my biological fathers family didn't stay in close contact, and I hate that I was never truly accepted by my stepfathers family. My mothers family is the only family I feel has truly accepted me and even then, there is no one unifying last name there due to divorces. I know that it's just a last name, but it shows my heritage.

52710,Relationships,2gdmsj,"Throwaway account, but my girlfriend is aware and supportive of this post. I will attempt to keep the details relevant and brief. 

My girlfriend and I met here on reddit back in April. We immediately hit it off, and arranged to spend two weeks together in person from the end of June into the beginning of July. After just one day together, we confirmed we were in love, and began our relationship. Since she left in July, we've been maintaining a long distance relationship. We rarely have disagreements, and even when we do, I'd hardly call it arguing. We're very similar in many ways, but one of our key differences is that I am very cautious whereas she never really considers negative consequences. She's not necessarily a risk taker, she just doesn't acknowledge that risks exist. 

Back before she came to visit, when we were still just friends but feelings were clearly blossoming between us, she tried meth with some coworkers. She told me that night, and explained her reasoning; it was something she'd been curious about trying, and she felt she was in a safe environment with people she could trust. I don't doubt any of that, but I was very disappointed she had used this drug, and expressed that to her. She did not regret what she had done, but she understood my feelings and promised me she would never use meth again, it was a one-time thing.

Fast forward to the other day, and we got on the topic of marijuana; she asked if I'd try some she has with her when I come to visit her. This morphed into a discussion about drugs in general, and I told her I wanted her to promise me not to use drugs again while we're together. I've never had a high opinion (no pun intended) of drugs, and I don't like the idea of her doing something potentially harmful to herself. Her attitude is that there's nothing wrong with occasionally trying drugs. 

She's not an addict, and admits she doesn't see herself using any drugs any time soon. But she says she's uncomfortable with making a promise because she feels she'd end up breaking it. She also essentially wants to keep her options open, because if the right opportunity presented itself there's other drugs she'd like to try (such as ecstasy). This makes me very uncomfortable, and I've told her that it makes me feel unimportant to her, that she's selfishly choosing something she'd briefly enjoy over my peace of mind and happiness. 

We've reached a compromise for now: if she should find herself in a situation where she'd like to use a drug, she'd talk to me first. This isn't a long-term solution though, because the end result would be that if it's something she wants to do, she'll do it anyways, regardless of how I feel. I really don't want her to use drugs, even just once in a blue moon, but she says herself that that's something she's not ready to commit to. 

We're not sure how to proceed. We'd like a way to resolve this issue, but so far we haven't figured out how to. Hopefully the good people of reddit can provide us with perspective and advice. I hope I didn't leave anything out, and I'll be happy to clear up anything that doesn't make sense.

**tl;dr**: My girlfriend wants to keep her options open and potentially try different drugs if she has the opportunity, regardless of my feelings on the matter and my request that she promise not to use any drugs. How do we resolve this disagreement?

**UPDATE**: Hey all, thanks for the responses and feedback. My girlfriend and I read it all and had a pretty good discussion. It turns out we'd been having a bit of a miscommunication, and one of my big concerns (that she was ignoring my feelings) was unfounded. So we're sticking with the compromise I mentioned above, and the fact of the matter is that it's pretty unlikely she'll be doing any drugs because she respects my feelings on it, but if she does want to, she'll talk to me about it first. All's well that ends well, matter resolved!","Me [27 M] with my LDR girlfriend [25 F] of about 3 months, I don't want her to use drugs but she won't promise not to.",0.0,False,13.0,37.0,1410712223.0,/r/relationships/comments/2gdmsj/me_27_m_with_my_ldr_girlfriend_25_f_of_about_3/,Romantic
86251,Breakups,2w1dvy,"I posted here a day or two ago, about my girl proposing a break after we'd been in an open relationship.

And update to that: well, I have her a huge Valentines Day surprise as planned, and she loved it. She said it's the best Valentines she's ever gotten. Rose petals on the bed, huge teddy bear, expensive heart box of chocolates, flowers, card, small teddy fox.. I went out. She loved it. We watched Crazy Stupid Love with Steve Carell, had pizza and wings, and made love. After that, she looked through my phone and saw that I was texting a friend who was talking about hooking me up with a girl. She got mad. I told her you wanted a break, to see other people and socialize. That's what I'm doing. We argued, I told her I wouldn't do what I just did for her for Valentine's Day for any other woman, that she was special. Then I got frustrated and left the house to go walk around the block. She got in her car and told me to get in when I got back. We discussed things.

She told me she loves me but I'm not that good at sex, she hasn't been satisfied for a while. She told me she's been seeing this guy (the guy who I thought it was) and having sex with him. I told her it's obvious who she wants. I told her I hope she enjoys him and I wish them luck, because obviously we've just thrown 10-11 months down the drain. She said she knows he'll hurt her if they try a relationship. I said well then good luck. I told her I wanted my engagement ring back before she moves out (and guess what, he's who she's moving in with, talk about salt in your wounds). She kept saying she still loves me. She asked if I would wait for her. I said yes. She asked if I hated her, and I said no. So now, we broke up officially and she's gonna be with him. I was a perfect man to her. Never cheated, never lied, always loved her as much as I said I did. Now it's over. Maybe she'll miss me in time. Through everything she said soaked in tears, she said she's not use to guys treating her right and said she's sad and sometimes wanted to commit suicide. I told her not to, because she's not the one getting hurt. I went inside and went to bed, and invited her in by texting the offer to come to bed and cuddle one last night still stands... Goodnight. And she did. Woke up this morning, now I'm single.

I remember someone from the last post I made linking me to a story called The Grass is Greener on the other Side (GIGS). A story about a girl who leaves her heartbroken man, goes out and sluts it up, and 6 months later realizes she's being used for sex, and she misses being treated right. She then goes and asks for the man she dumped back, but he says no. I think I'm starting to experience something similar.

I just need to cut communications with her, and let her realize she just left the perfect man. Buys her everything, loves her unconditionally, and just wants to be loved.

14361,Non-Romantic,1vyord,"Here's the back story (and sorry ahead of time for any grammatical errors, it's freezing at the cafe I'm in and I can barely feel my fingers) :

Last semester I met this girl in one of my classes. From the first time I saw her I thought she was pretty cute but that was about it. Halfway through the semester she struck up a conversation with me, which eventually led to hanging out after class. The first time we hung out was somewhat awkward seeing as we didn't really know each other but boy did she make a lasting impression. In our very first conversation she showed a lot of interest in me and even invited herself to go to a show with me (which I ended up not being able to go to). She had said something in passing about a boyfriend, but it sounded like that was pretty far in the past. For the next few weeks we communicated entirely through Snapchat, which I thought was weird but I didn't really care because she was awesome and we clicked. 

Turns out she had a boyfriend...I should have stopped it once I learned but it was already too late, I had already fallen for this girl. We started seeing each other all the time, talking non-stop, and going on stupid little, romantic cliche adventure-esque date things. 

This went on for a few weeks and shortly thereafter she invited me to her room for her roommate's 20th. At this point I'm sure the people on her floor knew something was going on seeing as I spent so much time with her there the past few weeks, so I was a little uneasy about saying yes.

From the minute I showed up she was constantly at my side. I told her I had work the next morning so I wasn't going to be saying late so I didn't drink at all really, but boy did she. The more she drank the closer she got and the more she made it seem like we were together. When it was time to leave, she wouldn't let me go. Now I definitely knew something was up and explained to her that as much as I didn't want to, I had to. To be honest, I didn't feel comfortable staying at all, she had a boyfriend and clearly wasn't thinking straight. I liked her too much and even though if I stayed there was a good chance of more happening, I just didn't want her to do something she regretted and I didn't want to do something I couldn't live with. Eventually she agreed to let me leave but walked me to her car where she proceeded to kiss me.

A few days later we talked about it and she told me she left her boyfriend and needed time to figure things out. I assured her that I completely understood and would be there if she needed me. A week later we went to dinner, which I thought went well, but apparently later that night he came to get his stuff and they ended up talking things out. As much as I hate to admit it, I was pissed, but it was something I had to live with. 

The next 4 weeks after that was just us constantly talking about how much she wanted to be with me but felt she had to make things work with him. I found out that at the time we met she found out he had cheated on her. I found out that he was absolutely controlling, manipulative, and somewhat verbally abusive. I ended meeting the guy, after spending the day with her, and it all made me feel so bad because I'm not at all sneaky like this.

This continued on for another couple weeks until she basically fell off the face of the Earth. I went 6 months without seeing or hearing of her, but I thought about her every day, I just couldn't get over it, I'm still not over it. 

Last month she appeared again, single this time. We've hung out twice and it's almost as if nothing changed. We talked about what happened a little bit and I asked her why she came back. She told me he deleted me out of her phone (which I suspected all along) and that she needed to patch things up with me, for her own conscience. 

I ended up telling her that I still had feelings for her after the second time I thought her because I wanted her to know exactly where I stand. She said she needed time to herself but wants me around. I don't really blame her completely for what happened and I'm finding it impossible to move on. It's been 4 years since I've felt this way about anyone and I don't know what to do.

Beyond the obvious (fitness, health, beauty), what can I do to win him back? This man is amazing, and my depression after a horrible year is the cause of our unrest. I lost someone important in February, was arrested in June, lost my brother in November, and have fallen apart mentally. I'm a very unhappy person but I've already taken steps to correct that. I'm working out daily instead of 3-4 times per week, my psychiatrist increased my medicine by half again and gave me a better sleeping pill, and I'm doing all the other things that make me otherwise happy. I'm also not drinking at all.


We plan to reconnect in a month or so and minimize contact until then. I've already lost 7-8 lbs (the breakup diet, I'm not starving myself) and plan to lose another 7-8 in the meantime which will have me looking fit. I want to remind him that I'm here, remind him of the love we shared, and keep him from giving up on me.
I've already anonymously sent him his favorite beer (a rare German beer) that will arrive early next week. I planned to send him his favorite local food to arrive on Valentine's day.


What else can I do to keep myself on his mind and remind him of the sweet, loving person that I am? Any thoughts or advice would be greatly appreciated. I'd especially like ideas that don't cost money, not because I don't want to spend it, but because I don't want to feel like I'm buying his love.


It it helps, he is a man's man, an athlete, loves sports, loves fitness, is a sharp dresser. He loves craft beer, expensive scotch (I thought of getting him a custom label bottle of Johnny blue but I feel like that verges on a bribe), and Manhattans. There's almost no chance I will run into him without a planned visit, and i can't just stop by his place - he lives in a high rise with a door man and a check in system where they have to call the resident before you can go up.


Also, for the record, this isn't about me being lonely, wanting to be in a relationship, etc. This is about him, and wanting him to be happy (first and foremost), and us to be happy together. I love being single, am very happy being single, but I know he's worth the effort. I also know that if we got back together right now, we'd go back into the bad patterns. This takes time, which is why I'm asking for help - what can I do during this time that we very much need, to keep his mind on me and the positive memories?

22293,Non-Romantic,3fe5da,"I love my best friend. In our entire friendship, she has gone above and beyond to support me. She slept on the hospital floor with me when my soulmate was diagnosed with cancer. She was the first one to come to our house in the middle of the night on Thanksgiving when my sweet love had to say goodbye. (He was still in the room, too - it meant so much to me that she came to support me in such an intimate situation) I have had a mental illness for a long time and she visits me every single day when I'm in the hospital with my favorite food. I'm including all this info because I don't want the answer of just dump her which is likely after I describe her behavior.

 I don't think she is doing all this to be an awful person, I think something bad has happened in her life to cause her to act this way out of the blue.

For some reason, she has recently started to encourage me to do things that go against my morals and lifestyle. First, I have never eaten meat, dairy, eggs, etc. I don't usually bring this up because I don't want to make others uncomfortable, but she knows since we've been friends for such a long time. She keeps buying me food with these products in it. When I politely decline, she responds with Oh come on. Just eat it. I won't tell the cows. It is kind of weird to me, especially since I would probably get sick eating these foods at first. 

Second, she seems to be encouraging me to sleep with other people. One night, when we were out with friends, she made this guy come flirt with me and she pulled me aside and said he really wants you... I have a condom, take it... This is weird for 2 reasons. 1. I don't have casual sex as a matter of personal preference (though I totally support those who do!) and 2. I'm just not READY. I'm still living in the home I built with the one I love, with reminders of our life together that well... just isn't here anymore. My grief therapist told me that my actions at this point are completely normal - it's too soon to expect me to be over the blow of losing someone I planned to spend my whole life with. Why would she try to push me into this when I still cry like crazy walking past the yogurt isle at the store because it was his favorite food?

Finally, I have a mental illness that I absolutely 100% do not want to talk about, but I guess I have to mention it. My medicine makes my life normal. It is very strong medication though, and I can't drink with it. A lot of nights she will encourage me to skip my meds that night so I can drink. Also, people with this illness are strongly advised to not smoke marijuana due to a large correlation with the disease worsening, but she always pressures me into that too lately!

She met her current husband only a few months after we became friends and married him shortly after that. They kept the marriage a secret from almost everyone (including me) for three or four years because they married so he could get his citizenship. She eventually told me and others and admitted that they did not intend to stay together after he received his papers and everything (not completely sure how that works), but that it ended up being more than that so they stayed together.

I'm not really sure where to start. Her husband is not a good guy, and I am not the only one who thinks this. None of our mutual friends like him and her family basically refuses to admit they are married or even that he exists. He has no desire to see them and they have no desire to see him so they both just pretend the other does not exist. 

He does not have a job. He has no desire to work. He is never home and is always with friends.

My friend works full time. She also, up until recently when her husband graduated, did all of his school work while she was working on her degree and working full time. 

She has gained a lot of weight since we met. She has no self esteem anymore. She has changed so much. She is excellent at her job but refuses to acknowledge it. 

She never wants to go out or do things anymore. She cooks and cleans and works full time all while her husband does who knows what. 

She caught him cheating about two years ago and almost left him. He begged her to stay and she did. The details of the situation are pretty vague, I think she's in denial about it and never talks about it. 

I am actually afraid of her husband. I do not trust him. He is volatile and has emotional outbursts. She has mentioned that he is moody and can go from happy to angry in an instant. When I do see him, which is rare, he acts weird and makes me feel uncomfortable. 

They don't ever want to do couple-y things together or hang out, which makes me sad because she is my best friend.

I have tried occasionally to gently speak about their relationship but she is very close-mouthed about everything. She literally never speaks about any aspects of their relationship other than casually mentioning little tidbits--never anything negative at all. I find this out of the ordinary. Friends confide in each other and talk about their relationships. 

I have never seen any signs of physical abuse but I am suspicious that there is some sort of abuse going on. 

I'm not sure if she is in any actual, physical danger. But I am worried about her mental and emotional state. She does an okay job of putting on a good front but she has definitely changed as I mentioned before.

I feel like he is just a leech. He definitely has it good-- school done for him, meals cooked, free money, does whatever he wants.

143882,Relationships,2i1goq,"Trying to figure out how much background I need.  My wife and I are going through difficult times - mostly due to the fact that sometimes I'm an idiot and we don't get to see each other very often.

So, my wife and I met years ago while working together.  We got on really well, became good friends and spent a few months seeing each other.  I end up leaving the country to pursue career options.  We stay in touch over the next 5 years and I eventually go back for a holiday and to see her.  

It's like nothing has changed - we still get along great, can spend hours talking about all sorts and still have sexual chemistry.  We spend the next few weeks together and say ""Hey, fuck it - let's get married!"".  Now I know some people will probably think that was a stupid idea but I don't regret it and would do it again.  She is fantastic.  Intelligent, successful, beautiful, strong, sporty.... the list goes on!

Over the last year I've made lots of efforts to fly back to see her any chance I get (incredibly difficult with work - most of the time I'm in another country).  I finish this job in 4 months and from there I'll be moving in with her.  That career is done and dusted (a difficult choice and one I was willing to make to be able to have a marriage with her).

Now for a bit of background.  I've never really had a serious relationship before, I've had a couple of girlfriends up to about the 6 month point but no real intimacy or emotion.  I'll be brutally honest - basically I've been a womanizer for years.  Never terribly interested in settling down for a variety of reasons.  I've been constantly moving with work and most of the time tend to break off relationships after a few months (my wife knows my history - I told her everything before we were married).  It's all been about one night stands and just taking things as they come.  Unfortunately not good practice at all for being in a marriage as I'm realizing now.

I know I have many failings: 

I find it hard to show emotions - it might be due to my upbringing.  I don't like to show that things bother me or admit weaknesses.

I sometimes sugarcoat or lie about things - mostly all minor shit that shouldn't even be an issue but becomes an issue because I lie about it (example: Hey, I just read your text now/ That's not true - I know you read it last night/ Well, I was drunk last night, I can't remember reading it/ Why are you lying about stupid shit?).  

The vast majority of the time it seems like the lies are automatic - I think I need to stop and actually think before I open my mouth.  Sometimes I think it's from some idiotic idea of protecting her feelings.  She's not stupid though and sees straight through it and then gets (rightfully) mad at me for lying....

We have different life goals and values - I don't know exactly what I want in life.  She does.  Especially when it comes to expectations from relationships.  I feel a bit like a complete idiot a chunk of the time when I've fucked up and have no idea why.

We have massively different points of views - we argue about loads of things and have very different views on everything from religion to politics.  I don't quite see this as a massive issue.  I'm glad she has strong views on things - it's part of what makes her her.  Haha it would be nice if she could concede  a point every now and then though....

I have never, nor will I ever cheat on her.  Unfortunately she doesn't have a huge amount of trust in me due to a number of factors:  I'm away on a regular basis, my history of womanizing, the lies I have told her, the people I work with (a rather shady bunch when it comes to cheating on wives and girlfriends).  

I sometimes think I made a mistake telling her about them but I want to be honest.  The problem is I somehow look guilty by association.  We had an argument the other day when I mentioned a couple of the people I work with cheating on their wives on a business trip.  One of them was someone I'd suggested we go on holiday with months beforehand (him and his wife - me and her).  She said I should have mentioned he was an untrustworthy person (ie. cheats on his wife) a long time ago.  It hadn't even occurred to me.  I just thought - hey, we should all go on holiday together, it'd be great fun.

Just realising now what a massive wall of text this is.  Thanks for sticking with it.

I'm still getting the hang of how marriage works.  The fact that you're a team and no matter what you will have your other half's back.  I'm slowly (very slowly sometimes) getting to grips with the basic concept of just telling her EVERYTHING.

I want to be a good husband.  I want to make this marriage work.  We're only really learning about each other now in a lot of ways (I know, I know - what kind of fools get married on a whim).  I want to be with her - live a life with her, build a house, have adventures, travel, create...

So - any advice?  Anyone had similar issues and managed to overcome them?  Am I pretty much fucked?  Thoughts please!  Thanks for reading!  I'll update with pertinent info as and when, I'm sure I've forgotten something.

178163,Relationships,3gvpa5,"I met a girl named Rachel 3 months ago and we've been fwbs since. We're not really ""friends"" but we get along well enough and have sex around 2-3 times a week. I have an actual fwb, who I've been friends with since college, who I've been sleeping with for a year and see around 1-2 times a week. Rachel doesn't know about my other fwb (my other fwb does about Rachel though) but she never asked so I assume she knows she's not my only sexual partner. I've never asked her but I also assume I'm not Rachel's only sexual partner either.


For the past few weeks Rachel has been trying to get us to do couple stuff. She's been dropping hints about going out to eat, seeing movies, museums, light travel, etc. She's also been bringing up the topic of relationships and commitment, mainly about her friends but I get the message. I'm not stupid, I know that Rachel is developing feelings for me. However, our current arrangement suits us just fine. She comes to my house with takeout, we fuck and then she leaves. Both of us enjoy this and Rachel has stated at the beginning of our fwb relationship that she knows we're not together.


It's obvious that she wants us to be together, though. She's been texting and calling a lot more just to talk about mundane things, she's been trying to make the sex more intimate, and she's casually mentioned the idea of me meeting her friends just to hang out.


I don't want any of this. I'm perfectly content with Rachel being my fwb and she is seemingly happy with the way things are as well. She still asks to come over and always obliges me when I ask. But I know she wants more but is probably too afraid of losing me to take the next step. Rachel is a nice girl but I do not want to be in a relationship with her. 


At the same time I don't want to lose her either. I know it might be selfish of me but she's ok with just being fwbs and so am I. Some of you might tell me to just let her go but I'm not going to do that. We both enjoy the time we spend together and I have no intention of ending it. What I want is a way to get her to ease up on the couple stuff and reaffirm the nature of our relationship. However I don't want to break her heart in the process.


What should I say that can 

1) Confirm that we are and will only be fwbs

2) Not hurt her feelings


I'm worried I might have to explain to her why I don't want her as my girlfriend yet am happy to keep her as a fwb. I don't think there's any way to have that conversation without damaging her self-esteem. My other fwb suggested I just let things go on as they are until Rachel admits her feelings at which point I'll have to deal with it. What should I do?

For the first few months it was a clean friendship. When we became closer she started coaching me into making a move. After she would visit she would continue to ask me if I would've done something if she was single. After a while I kissed her. At this point I was vulnerable; I lived by myself, I was lonely, and she was about the only person who talked to me on regular basis. I realize this is not an excuse for this act. 

After the kiss things changed, we became closer and closer, I realized that this person was someone I really wanted. We have similar interests and get along amazingly. She started giving excuses as to why she couldn't leave her bf all the time and still has not done so. We have fought over this many many times and still no resolution. My problem is that I am lonely with no friends, she is my best friend and currently my life. I have tried to leave this twice but fell back because of the loneliness.

They also do not even act like they are dating, more like friends. When the three of us are in the same room, she will sit by me and cuddle up close while he sits across the room and stares.

When I left Hannah over infidelity, Rebecca did her very best to make sure I was okay. She gave me her time, her attention when she had things to do, and she generally made me forget what my ex-girlfriend made me feel like. But she never really took me in. I tried, I flirted as time went on, I pulled all the stops that seemed reasonable, but she never really returned it. It was clear that she wasn't ever going to really take my hand in a relationship, that she was being a friend and helping me out. That is okay, I am not mad at her, I am just a bit stuck.

We essentially started living together since we lived in the same apartment complex. We have a really strong relationship and it is really important to me to maintain that until we can be together. He just graduated so we would be doing a LDR for about 3 years until I graduate. 

My parents have always been extremely strict. I've dated and I wasn't even allowed out much, even for academic purposes. My dad is a high ranking police officer and we get along okay, but he sides with my NMom on pretty much everything. I can't really have legitimate discussion with either of my parents. I am positive my mom just uses me, and that my dad enables a lot. That is a whole other [story I can give for context](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2fhglb/advice_repost_i_submitted_this_in_the_late/) if anyone needs it. But I have been dreading living with them for these 10 months because of her.

My boyfriend's first visit here was this weekend. My dad told me he is not allowed to sleep in my bedroom and that this was his house and not mine and it was different from sleeping in the same room when we were back at college. Which was not something I really argued with but I did try to tell him why I felt like it should be different. But I accepted what he said. My dad had to move somethings down from Northern California for my mom (she is also moving back in they have been separated.) So he would be gone for the weekend. We aren't allowed to be at my house alone. So we decided to go to my grandparents house. We hung out there and my boyfriend has met them more times than my parents. My grandparents are wonderful comfortable people who pretty much raised me until I was about 11. We stayed the night there and they had no problem with us sleeping in the same bed. 

In the morning he dropped me off at my house and went back home about 2 hours away. We plan to alternate visiting each other every two weeks. The next morning (today) my dad is supposed to drive back here with my brother. I facetimed my mom and he was still there. She asked me where we slept at my grandmas house. And I told her the truth. She told my dad and he bounded at the phone and started screaming at me and cussing at me and yelling extremely loud. Like I had done the worst thing in the world. Like he hated me. He told me I disrespected him and that I knew how he felt and had went against what he said. He never let me talk. He told me there were consequences for what I had done and that my boyfriend was no longer allowed at his home. He threw the phone back at my mom and I tried to talk to her. She said she would talk to him but that he's livid and she stands by what he says.

He is also apparently angry with my grandparents because they knew how he felt about it. I told them the truth because I felt like I wasn't breaking a rule or trust. It wasn't my dads home it was my grandparents and they were fine with it. My relationship with my boyfriend is going to be hard enough and I don't know if I can handle this. My grandparents think this is ridiculous and said I can move in there, but I  cannot afford college without my parents help. I realize I maybe should have talked to my parents about sleeping together at my grandparents but I don't think it should have escalated the way that it did. I have been completely honest with my parents. They are not religious or anything and I have almost always followed their very strict rules. I don't know what to do. He will be home in about 4-5 hours and I know he will just scream at me like he and my mom always do. I can't have conversations with them. I'm not 16. I am about to be 21.

So a little background, I am in the military, and my job gives me little to no free time. I'm also happily married as of 2 months ago, my wife is about 6 months older than me. She has a job as a social worker, and we are staying separate (about 3 hours away) so she can get her license and make more money before we decide to finally move in together. Besides, I am going on a long, 6 to 9 month deployment in a couple of months so there is no reason for her to come up here, so we are being responsible and staying separate until after the deployment. We both have our lives completely in order, and I couldn't be happier with her....

Except my parents are in the nastiest divorce this side of the Mason Dixon line, and we are caught smack dab in the middle of it. 

They have been at each other's throats since four years ago when my dad lost his job (80k a year to almost nothing) and couldn't pay for myself and my four siblings. My brother joined the Marines and i joined the navy, to get out (plus the thought of my parents financing our college was thrown out the window) 
And we started living together.

 I never liked my dad, my mom has always been sweet to me, except with any matters concerning my dad. All the blame has been thrust to him, and for the most part, she is right. But she has gone to court with him, kept him from seeing the kids, gotten him fired at any job he has tried to get, and yet, if he can't give her the  money she won in court, they could throw him in jail. I had to plead with him for a while day for him to come to our wedding, because initially, he was so mad at her, he didn't want to come, because he knew she would be there. 

Finally, his recent girlfriend left him (most likely due to the whole fiasco) and he has had enough. He texted me that he wanted to live with me (with the implications that he wouldn't pay rent)  as well as this message ""Sorry. I'm in a bad place in my life and I feel suicidal every day. [his girlfriend 45f] is gone and I'm alone . Your mother won't let me talk to your sisters[twins, 9f] . [youngest brother 16m] doesn't call ever. And I'm flat broke. I have nothing left . That's the just of it . I'm at the end of my rope . ""

And i just broke down. 

I don't care how much of an asshole my dad is...nobody should have to go through this. But if I let him live at my house, I don't know if that will fix it. My wife doesn't want him to live there, and I am inclined to agree. She has texted my dad's sister and reached out to my brother and myself, and has sent my dad the phone number to a mental health service, but my dad has a stupid amount of pride. He wears expensive looking clothing and drives a nice car, because he absolutely HATES seeming weak, so I think, shoving programs in his face may make him shut down to it. A ""you can lead a horse to water, bit you can't make him drink""  type scenario. 

I want to help cause he is my dad, but I am just unquestionably lost right now. A part of me wants to be like ""fine, come live with me"" a part of me wants to send money to him until he gets on his feet. I could support it. A part of me wants to scream at my mom and make her stop harassing my dad. Neither of them understand that regardless of their crappy situation, the people that hurt the most are their kids. The ugly truth is, that until my sisters and brother leave the house, they could seriously traumatize them, and they need to settle their differences so they can get on their feet.

I must admit I was very jealous . 

We had so many arguments to the point were he stop showing as much affection . He stop caring about our fights to the point were he would just kick me out and tell me to leave him alone . I started begging him to talk to me . Then after that he would constantly do it over and over again . He would go one to two weeks without talking to me because he felt depress or he wanted space . He never wanted space the first year of us been together . He would tell me he didn't believe in it. 

Over time all of the arguments and times he would walk away from our relationship. I would get more and more depress . My anxiety and panics attacks started to become a everyday thing. Now I don't wanna blame him for my anxiety because I suffer from anxiety at a young age however I never had it to the point were I had it everyday . Lately things have been very rocky for us. We argue everyday and it feels like he doesn't want to talk to me as much 

 I try so hard to have a conversation with him but he just doesn't seem to be so interested . Now he knows my anxiety has worsen but he doesn't believe he has anything to do with it . Now while I'm going through this he also has problems of his own he suffers from . He gets depress from time to time . He gets very irritated with things easily and he is not happy with his life . He has told me in the future he would like to move out of his house to live his life since his been practically like a father to his sister . because of his situation his not even sure if he wants kids . I always imagine myself with kids but as of lately I've been wondering if I want one myself in the future but I believe I'm still too young too think about it . I just hope my relationship with him is not just making me change my mind . 

Anyways I feel like my anxiety has worsen . Everytime I get scared and feel like he wants to get away from me I start to panic and my anxiety hits me again . I feel as if he makes my anxiety go away the moment im with him .  It's scared me and I don't know what i should do? Should I stop trying to chase him everytime he leaves the relationship or do I need to just give him his space. I love him and I imagen the rest of my life with him however I believe he doesn't anymore ... 


Update : last night we had a talk about his friends having a party at his house. Now he has a group of friends and they brings their girlfriends. Now I'm a very shy person with people I don't know and I tend to have a very serious face . Which many people get intimidated by.
I try to talk to his friends but I don't get to for a long time. I just keep quiet . Apparently the guys gf think I don't like her and my bf girl friend thinks I don't like her either. They have made this very clear in front of everyone when I'm not around. I told my bf I wanted to go to the party. However he feels like if I just sit there and don't do anything or talk to anyone I'm gonna ruin his night and I might as well not go
. He said that if he seems me not taking to them he will just have us leave the party. I told him its very hard to talk to everyone when the music is really loud and is very dark . Plus the people in there are some people I haven't seen. Now for get me wrong once I have talked to a person and know them I'm more open and outgoing .
I'm just very shy when I meet someon te first time and sadly I get judge for it. However he told me I need to try harder with his friends because their not going to ?

13971,Breakups,2wcgkb,"Hi guys.

So my ex and I were together for two and a half years. We live together in a two bedroom house. Although our breakup was not mutual (her idea), it wasn't physical, aggressive, or awful. Just really upsetting on my part. For a few reasons, we have decided to stay in our house until the end of the lease (end of April so not too long). We have moved our things and each of us has a separate bedroom. We are civil to each other and are able to pay bills and communicate about household stuff (so far at least). I am really upset and hurt over this breakup because I honestly thought we were going to get married, I even was going to buy her engagement ring with my tax return. But anyway...

She already has a new boyfriend (we only broke up at the beginning of the month and they were already talking one week after so I suspect there was something going on beforehand but that's beside the point). The first time she tried to bring him to our house, she pretty much just told me he was going to be coming by to drop off flowers (Valentine's Day) and that he wasn't coming inside or anything but that she hoped I was going to be at work at the time. I freaked out and told her it was extremely inappropriate to allow her new boyfriend to come to OUR house while I am still mourning our relationship and still very upset about everything and this guy. I told her she was welcome to meet him anywhere but he would not be coming here. She apologized and realized she was wrong, said she understood how inappropriate it was and she never should have even thought it was okay, and that they would meet somewhere else.

Her boyfriend lives with roommates and she doesn't sleep at home anymore, so I figure she stays with him at night but I know having roommates can suck especially at the beginning of a relationship.

So here's my thing. Next month I'm going to a friend's wedding and I'll be gone for five days. I want to ask my ex to be respectful of me and our house and not have her boyfriend over while I'm gone. 

I know, if I never knew it happened what would be the harm? Well my ex isn't all that attentive of this new situation. She frequently leaves her dirty clothes on the bathroom floor, her boyfriend's tshirts and other clothing that he's given her to wear, right out in the open (I know they are his because he goes to a college here and plays a sport at school and they are all clothes from that school and sport), along with, TMI, but panties with lots of dried vaginal fluid indicative of sexual activity. And I'm not going through these clothes either, they are just tossed on the floor before she showers or whatever. She also has started listening to country after starting to date this guy, and blares country music whenever she is home even if she knows I'm here. She posts on her various social media pages about this guy, etc etc. (sidenote I have either deleted my social media or blocked her so I can't see those anymore).

Basically what I'm saying is even though she tells me she is sensitive to my feelings of loss and how hurt I am about this breakup, she clearly isn't putting it in the forefront of her mind. I am trying to be understanding because I know how swept up people can get in a new relationship. 

Anyway what I'm trying to say is I want to ask her not to have her boyfriend over to our house while I'm gone because I'm afraid I'll either find out somehow through the internet or mutual friends mentioning it, or she'll leave some kind of evidence in our house. 

It makes me sick to my stomach to think about them being together, like I said I thought this girl was the one I was going to be with forever, and in less than a month I've gone from being with her to being single while she's already with someone else. So thinking about them in our house together, cuddling on the couch we used to cuddle on, showering in our shower together, fucking in what used to be our bed, I just won't be able to handle it.

So what do you think, it it unreasonable for me to ask her to not bring him here while I'm gone? Or is it her right to bring him here while I'm not here, as it's her house too?

EDIT: I wouldn't mind her bringing her boyfriend over when I was gone IF I had no idea, but like I said in my post, she's pretty careless when it comes to trying to keep me in the dark. When we broke up I even told her, if we're going to live together, I need you to not tell me if you're dating anyone else, I just can't know. And what do you know, first chance she gets she tells me she has a new boyfriend. All I'm trying to say is if I had no idea I would be fine. Ignorance is bliss. But she's just not good at that whole thing.

And title is correct, I'm a girl, ex is a girl, she now has a boyfriend.

My step-sister [27] was diagnosed with schizophrenia when she was 14. She spent some time in a mental institution and has been taking her medication since then (not sure what the names of them are). About 6 months ago, she was attempting to get pregnant with her husband of 4 years. This requires her to stop taking her medication for schizophrenia as you cannot get pregnant while on it. 

Since she stopped taking the medication, her condition has become worse and worse. For example, she first thought she was pregnant, then she was sure it was twins and then triplets but one of them was lucifer's baby. Despite pregnancy tests coming back negative, she insisted it was true. She used this to refuse medication.

Fast forward to now, and she is having hallucinations of a bad man hiding in the attic, calling herself spongebob because everyone is laughing at her, and putting random food and liquids in the bathtub and sink, clogging them.

I feel powerless to stop her because my parents seem to not be doing anything. One of my step-brother's died 3 years ago and I believe my step-father is too afraid to lose another child so he is not acting in his right mind. He has resorted to weed to reduce his stress and that seems to be his only course of action.

I'm afraid that if I tried to stop any of the crazy things she does, she will attack me and I will end up hurting her to defend myself.

79929,Dating,1k6jnb,"Over the past few months, a co-worker from a different department who works near me has been talking to me more and more. She is drop-dead gorgeous, and I'm average at best, so at first I just thought she was being friendly and that I had no chance with her.

The past few weeks, however, I've noticed some of her behavior that might mean she is more interested than I thought, but I don't know if that is just wishful thinking on my part. I'd rate my social skills as below average, and sometimes I have a hard time reading people. This situation is a little trickier since we work together, so I don't want to read too much into it and make it awkward. 

Here are a few things I've noticed:

1) She's invited me out for dinner/drinks a few times. They haven't been really formal, and there have always been other people she's invited, but I'm always the only other single person she invites, and she always sits next to me.

2) We found out that we are fans of rival NFL teams that play each other the last week of September. She suggested we go to a bar together to watch the game, then whoever's team loses has to buy lunch the next day.

3) She's come over to look at things on my computer a few times, and when she does I sort of move out of the way to give her room to comfortably look at it, but she always ends up getting unnecessarily close to me, often to the point of touching heads.

4) Lots of small, flirty/friendly things - frantically playing with her hair whenever we talk, mirroring my behavior sometimes, asking me about personal things I post on Facebook, etc.

On the less convincing side - her behavior in general is fairly fun and flirty with lots of people. I am really starting to like her and would like to see if this could go beyond a simple friendship, but I don't want to screw things up and make work awkward (I have a lot of money and my job is in high demand, so worst case scenario I get shot down, things get really awkward, and I just move on, but I'd prefer it if that didn't happen!). So, I have two questions:

1) Does it sound at all like there might be something there? What other signs can I look for to either confirm or disprove the idea that she might want there to be something more between us?

2817,Relationships,2zlt44,"About 5 months ago I posted a situation in which I put myself in, I had an emotional and not really deep affair with a friend of mine.

Short story was that I got a female friend, we became best friends, about March 2014 things got slightly romantic through written emails and phone text messages for a couple of weeks.

Whenever we saw each other we kept it as regular friends and two weeks later we talked about how we should preserve our friendship as it was something we'd both like to keep for life. 

I was stupid for letting this happen, and even more so for not telling my wife. 

My wife then found out, I just had to confess.

For a while I just wanted my wife to forgive me and my friend and let things be the way they were, I know, silly me....

My wife and I seem to have made it through this mess I created. But it seems to me that she was partially able to forgive me by putting all the blame on my former friend.

I think I should call myself lucky and keep quiet, but I'm not ok with that, it feels as if it's unhealthy for my wife, hence for both of us.

Just this week I have lost sleep over the fact that my wife will start an activity that may put her at the same place as my former friend, I told her my concerns, and she ranted about how she hates her and will always hate her.

I try to reason a bit, I tell her that I understand, but that she's placing her hate on a person that never had a commitment or obligation with her, that by doing that she may never find a reason to let go of that hate, and she's adamant in her reply, and twists what I say into me defending my former friend.

I'd say: it's not that I'm defending her, calling her a whore does not make her one, I wish you'd see her as a person who made a mistake, did not intend to do you harm and backed out before anything got serious, I'm the one who betrayed you and your trust, grabbing onto this hate is not good for you at all, and you know that this hate should be directed at me

Her answer went something like: to me it sound like you're defending her and that makes me hate her even more, I hated you for a while but I love you and want this to work

Going to a psychologist seems not to be an option for her, and what I said is what it is, I'm worried that she's does not consider even the possibility of trying to work towards a future where she'll stop feeling all this hate.

Any suggestion is welcomed and appreciated.

Sometimes I'm not sure what feels worst to me, the pain I caused, or the hate I created in her.


It stills saddens me to have to call my former friend a former friend...

91106,Relationships,2zwyyu,"Alright so, me and my girlfriend are high school sweethearts. I know this is typically frowned upon and a pretty big red flag, but allow me to defend myself. We are very much in love. Everytime we hang out, it's a good time, we're always on each other's mind and make each other very happy, and it's always been this way. I know people say to just break up with your high school relationship at a certain point but to me that would just be so useless since we are so happy together and life is just really good together. So hopefully everyone can kind of look past that.

On to the situation, so after High School my girlfriend went to the local community college, and I went about an hour away to a local state school. I hated it, it was miserable, I hated my major(which was the main focus of the school), and I just wanted to die. The missing my girlfriend part sucked, but it's not why I hated the school. I would often times see her on weekends, and in High School we really mainly hung out on weekends anyways so that part didn't feel like a big difference. After a miserable semester at the school, I decided to come home and go the community college, so I could try and save some money while figuring out what to do with my life.

That was a year ago, I'm now in my fourth college semester, and my third at the community college, and I have finally found what I want to study. So naturally the next decision becomes what 4 year university to transfer to. Me and my gf floated the idea of going together, because why not? It seemed like it could be really fun and if we both liked the school it shouldn't be an issue. However, she plays college sports, she played them at the community college and planned on playing them when transferring so that was a factor, and I'm always cool with that.

So she narrowed her search down to two schools(for sports purposes) and one of which was an all-girls school, the other is about 2 hours away out of state. She checked out the girls school and liked it, and I know she likes to be close to her family so at that point I think we both kind of figured she would go there. With that in mind I thought it was time I picked my own school and I narrowed down my options, and applied to my first choice, an in state school. It was about a half hour from the all girls school so I thought that was a bonus too. 

I told my eager parents and they were pretty happy I was finally deciding, they're ready to support me, etc. And just recently, my girlfriend decided to visit the other school two hours away. She fell in love with it. She loved the atmosphere, her major program, the sports team,  everything. And I'm extremely happy for her but now of course these thoughts are entering my head that maybe I should look into this. If I go and check out the school and love it, I would love to go to school with her. The only problems are:

A. It would be impossible to convince friends and family I'm not ""following"" her and I'm sure they would all frown upon it. 

B. The big issue. The money. After already spending all that money at my one semester away at school, and after getting their hopes up with staying in state, I don't know how I could get my parents to help me on this one. It's about 15 k more expensive than my instate option and I don't know if my reasoning will be enough for my parents.

Any help? I know the logical answer says we should just go to different schools and I should save my money, but I just can't help but worry I could be missing out on such a good experience. I plan on visiting the school soon and see how I like it anyways but I'm just really in a pickle here.

TLDR; long time gf was originally going to transfer to an all-girls school so I told my parents about a school I had in mind, now she wants to go a little further to a different school and I want to join but don't know if I can convince my parents because of the expenses.","Me [20 M/F] with my girlfriend [20 M/F] been together since High School, we're both leaving for college next year and I need some advice.",0.0,False,2.0,2.0,1427042203.0,/r/relationships/comments/2zwyyu/me_20_mf_with_my_girlfriend_20_mf_been_together/,Romantic
165141,Non-Romantic,3b64p7,"I tried to get her help, but she brushes it off saying ""it's fine"" or ""I'm not crazy"".  Though I reassure her saying, there's nothing wrong with getting help, she doesn't take it.  She's been this way since she was 13, and has been fighting it, but it's been worse lately.  She's saying it's uncomfortable everywhere she goes and it's tiresome just living.  I've told her she needs help and needs to see a therapist, which is something she encourages other people to do, but she denies needing it or even having a problem.  

I've tried being passive about it, I've tried being pushy about it, I've tried waiting for her to come to me, but after her actually trying to kill herself, I fear this is the last chance.  Especially since she's been getting increasingly impulsive and bears terrible guilt for small things she's done in the past.  She blames herself for everything that no one has ever pointed out (from what I know at least).   Things she's done years ago, she still feels terrible for today, and, again, it's nothing compared to what other people may do.

Due to her feelings of guilt, she also feels that she's a waste of money and space.  So if I were to push therapy or medication on her, she would feel guilty about the cost of it.  Where I live, one visit to a psychologist is anywhere from $100-400.  I've tried to find cheaper therapists, but since she's not willing to take help, I'm not sure she'd even talk to them.

Something happened a year ago that may have affected her more, was when my boyfriend killed himself in our house that we are currently living, in the room about seven feet away from her room.  I found him and, this is my fault, but when I was in shock and screamed I let my mom and my sister (same sister) find him as well.  She was definitely traumatized, but never talked about it because she was scared to bring it up.  I think she felt like she didn't deserve to talk about it around me? feeling like I had it worse? though I NEVER believed that.  I tried talking to her about it but, again, she brushes it off.  I'm not sure if this event is the sole purpose for her emotions and actions escalating, but she's definitely been more open about it to me since.

She's a good girl and I want to help her.  She fights and believes in human rights and she tries to help anyone who needs it.  She just won't accept help herself.

I came in all geared up and just wanted to get in and out. When I was purchasing my stuff at checkout she struck up conversation with me.

In between her love for art, the fact that she chatted me up, she likes motorcycles, this is the point where I said fuck it, you only live once and asked her on a ride. I offered to give her my number, but she just politely said ""come back when I'm working next time"".

So I was missing one of my rear footrest pegs for passengers. I had to order one and it just got in yesterday. I fixed it on my bike today and now it's been a week later since the initial introduction (I figure hey, I gotta get some groceries and that way it doesn't seem like I'm being creepy even though I'm looking forward to this). I roll into the parking lot and I actually see her at the side of the building stocking with the door open, she notices me because my bike is pretty loud (and that's the location of the parking lot)

At this point I figure if she's busy I don't want to bother her at her work. I know I already broke cardinal ask out rule #1 which is don't ask people out at their jobs. At the same time I also assume if she's interested (for real interested) she'd maybe make herself available for discussion if she recognizes me? It was just a thought.
I see she seems to turn away from where I have parked, I get a little bit of a sinking feeling but I know she's working and I try to put myself into her shoes and I assume she's busy. No biggy.

Anyways, I get my stuff and pay some other dude who is manning the cash register, no sign of her. I leave, and as I'm leaving I see her again, she seems preoccupied and I kind of get a feeling maybe she was ignoring me. It was really hard to tell because I was looking forward to getting to know this girl and it seems like I misread the shit out of her. She had her back turned to me most of the time and didn't move from her spot. It had the appearance of maybe she wasn't working and just trying to avoid me.

Now I'm debating... should I actually go back and play it cool and just let her know that the offer is always on the table the next time I grab some groceries. I feel like I fucked up asking her about her tattoos and / or asking her out at her job in general. I didn't want to create some sort of tense friction but she genuinely seemed interested + positive body language + she was smiling and had that look in her eyes like she enjoyed talking to me. Maybe I misread all of this, any thoughts?

176081,Relationships,1zj99h,"I [F25] have been with my SO [M24] for 5 years. Last year I started to have my doubts, something just didn't fit anymore. We went on vacation together and we fell out over silly things. I told him a crack had appeared in our relationship but he denied it and told me it was just me.

Fast forward to December 2013 where I became close to a male co worker, who before the month was out eventually made an advance on me. I turned him down, but I found myself sad that I had too as this co worker was offering me affection and attention that I don't think I've ever had with my SO. My SO is uncomfortable with public affection (as little as holding hands), and doesn't like sharing and buying gifts etc. I was okay with this when we first started seeing each other as I didn't realise we'd be together for so long. I do love him and we have a lot in common.

However, now I'm pointing out to him that I need some of these relationship ""norms"" and he doesn't ""see it"" which makes me doubt myself.

In the meantime, I'm still good friends with this co worker who is so much more ""boyfriendy"" with me. We went out for dinner once (which I felt guilty about and did tell my SO) but that's all it was, dinner. But the way he was with me was so different to my SO, there was an easy flow.

I'm 25 years old and I've never had my hand held, been kissed in public, had someone put their arm around me, slow dance with me etc. My SO leaves any inter-personal behaviour to inside our apartment. I am aware that these are his issues with relationships or whatever, but am I overreacting? When I tell him I want these things he says they've not been an issue for me so far and it's unfair to put him out of his comfort zone and ask him to change.
What am I experiencing? I don't understand what's happening inside of me.

18618,Relationships,1nl9px,"I've known my girlfriend, we'll call her Melissa, for a little over 2 years.


Her best friend started dating one of my closest friends and Melissa started hanging out with us and became part of our group.


Up until this past April, her and I never really spoke much but I was always attracted to her.  She on the other-hand had a huge crush on one of my other friends, but he didn't return the feelings.


Anyways, this past April at a party her and I just ended up starting up a conversation.  We realized we actually got along pretty well.  


We started hanging out alone, and within a week it became sexual.  


Now at this point she told me it was just a FWB thing.  She still was in love with my other friend, and she also spent a lot of time hanging out with her ex-boyfriend, admitting they still had something sexual going on.  


I thought I would be fine with that but by the end of May I had really fallen from her.  I told her I had to stop seeing her, I know she doesn't want a relationship, and it would be better for me.  


Surprising she told me to forget what she said before, she wants to be in a relationship with me.


So at that time we became official.


For the first couple months I felt like I was much more invested in the relationship than she was.  She still hung out with her exboyfriend at least once a week, even staying overnight at his house a few times, (she swore she slept on the couch and it was only because she was drunk and that she would never cheat on me).


Around the end of July she had a party and her ex was there.  At one point in the night he comes up to me drunk and tells me I need to just give it up, that she doesn't give a shit about me.  He then says to me, You know she told me you've got the smallest dick she's ever seen.


I get really pissed off and told him to fuck off that she wouldn't say that.  He says Oh really?  Well she also told me the first night you guys tried to have sex you were so nervous you couldn't get hard, and then the first time you actually managed you finished in under a minute.


Now as embarrassing as it is to admit, that's the truth.  
I was really hurt that she not only told someone about that, but that she told it to her exboyfriend.  


Later that night I confronted her about it.  She apologized and said it was before we were officially together, and she was sorry.


Since then, she's done a complete 180.  She's stopped hanging out with her ex, and she's completely invested herself in the relationship.  She even recently told me that we should get an apartment together.


The thing is....I just have such a hard time being able to trust her.  She's become pretty much the perfect girlfriend lately, and I feel VERY strongly about her, but I just get this weird and untrusting feeling after everything.

Am I wrong for that?  How can I get over it?

Prologue: I have a bit of social anxiety that makes it really difficult for me to carry on a conversation. I hate parties, but more so school football games.

A few nights ago I went to a  school football game for the first time because my friend convinced me so I went. My and him hung around with my crushes group of friends and I somehow found it really easy to talk to my crush. 

We talked for a while(she actually told me some really depressing stuff about her family life) and she even gave me her number.

The problem is, I'm pretty sure it was of pity. You see, I'm somewhat a social outcast; I don't go to many parties, I'm rather quiet, and I'm also a bit, umm, round( so is her but she is really nice and sweet) But I'm also pretty ugly. I like to consider myself funny but I say a ton of stupid things. She texted me afterwards but again, I'm sure it was pity.

The problem: My best friend told one of my not-so-much friends that I did like her, and then my not-so-much friend told her. She came up to me today and said, to the best of m remembrance,"" Umm, so not-so-much friend told me what you said."" I pretended to not understand, then I said, ""Oh yeah, that."" The killer though was that she said, ""Yea, awkward.""

What should I do about this? Should I avoid her completely, act normal around her, what? My biggest fear is that everyone learns and then people have another thing to laugh at my about besides my social anxiety.

116681,Relationships,3hewuv,"My boyfriend and I have been in a long distance relationship for 8 months now. It's been tough trying to start our relationship as LDR especially b/c this is the first relationship for both of us. However, we have known each other since elementary school and have been friends ever since so we have a pretty decent foundation to hold up our relationship. 

The only problem right now is that my boyfriend is in a depressive episode. I knew about his depression before starting the relationship, but this is the worst episode yet. Usually when he ""feels down,"" it lasts for a day and he still manages to text me consistantly throughout the day and to call me at the end of the day. But this time its been going on for a few weeks now and his mood has been very very inconsistent. One day he seems fine, and then the next day he wakes up and give me very cold replies over text. We recently broke up because I kept asking him to call/skype more and he felt like he couldn't do more as a boyfriend to satisfy me. We got back together after a day because he regretted the decision and also I didn't want to give up on our relationship. Still, we call considerably less now and his replies over text are very short. To many people who aren't in an LDR, this might seem like not a big deal. But texting, calling and skyping are the only things we can really do to spend quality time together over the distance. Also, he is less ""lovey-dovey."" 

I miss his usual self that used to be very much engaged in the relationship. And it's kind of hard for me to deal with this because I personally have not been through a major depressive episode. Today he told me how it feels to be depressed: he only wants to eat, sleep, and entertain himself through stuff on the Internet. He said he doesn't really want to talk to people because they can't do much to help his depression. 

One thing I know is that I definitely do not want to leave him while he is going through this. Right now, I feel like our emotional intimacy has decreased quite a bit, and I feel a lot more distant from him than before. I even have thoughts about breaking up and how easy it would be to do so. But what I have learned is that a relationship consists of not only spending happy moments together but facing life challenges together as well. 

I just would like to ask if anybody has any advice to help me deal with my boyfriend's depression? What can I do to help him feel better and how can I stay optimistic and hopeful throughout this?

A small backstory: I know this is gonna sound like a typical youngsters don't know what love is kind of post, but this is the girl I always saw myself with. We'd been together almost two years when things started to go a bit sour, not bad per se, but just a bit, normal. We weren't clicking on the same level. We decided to go on a break for a couple of weeks and see what happens. Long story short: I initially wanted to get back together, she convinced me breaking up was the right thing to do.

It got almost like we were married. Comfortable rather than happy. Seeing each other every day, but only for like 2 hours before falling asleep. Like I say though, not bad, just not actively good. That kind of thing. And I love her, but I'm not ready for that and neither is she. I myself need time to mature, by myself, and focus on what's best for me after uni.

But we still very much love each other. She's the most important part of my life and I can't be without her in some capacity. We decided to try and be friends but man that's the hardest shit. I just dunno what to do man. I feel, and think she feels it too, that we'll be back together at some point. But fuck me if that doesn't seem like so far away.

I guess I just don't know how to get through this. Never had this kind of break up before.

Short long story: after 2 years in a complicated relationship (I am quite stressed and depressed by a severe family situation), my bf found consolation with the other girl in our group of friends (not sex but still...).

He confessed that to me 1 week after. The whole group knew it but i didnt. I forgave him but it was not the same anymore for me, i couldnt trust him anymore, i felt humiliated and he acted in a way that forced me to end the relation abruptly.

Few days later i came back to have some explanations about his behaviour and he said he wanted to stay alone.

So i started to lie to him in order to obtain the truth. He told me i was not so pretty as the other girl, that i was hypochondriac, depressed, hysteric (which is true) and that he never liked my body that much. He said he know he will never find another girl deep and intelligent as me but still wanted to break with me and stay alone. Probably because of my negative aura.

So i left him and all my friends as well.

I was mad with them because they covered the whole situation. They (including the girl) kept hanging out with my bf (who wanted to stay alone???) and they never asked me how i felt or if i needed somebody to talk with.

I also discovered that the girl is now planning on taking my bf in few months and i suspect she tried to take him away from me before as well (maybe saying how i was depressed and such, idk).

important mention: all of that happened without having a real face to face speaking, because he didnt wanted to.

he left me after 2 years without even talking to me irl, like i were garbage.

i know i was problematic because of my depression and that maybe i was not that sweet with him, but still, i did facts instead of sweet words. i was always here for him when i needed me and discovering how he cheated on me destroyed myself because i really trusted him. i chose him because he was so pure and honest with me when i first met him.

I already had trust issues when i knew him and he knew it. he also knew that my previous bf abandoned me without an explanation after 2 years. he did the same. he did this to me and all i ever asked to him was to be honest and loyal.

i cant' understand why. he never had a reply  for this.
and when i told him what i told you, he felt annoyed by that and blocked me from facebook.

I know he didnt deserved me and that i am lucky because i discovered how bad he was.

but still, there is something devouring me from the inside: i feel angry, even more depressed than before, unable to trust anyone, apathic and at the same time obsessed with thoughts about him, her, them and what they did to me.

I ofter think about suicide and self destruction, although i am trying to get in shape again and be healthy. I know i wont make it because i feel like somebody kicked me in my weak knees. 

and even if i would manage to do so, i know i want to stay alone because i dont trust people anymore.

I lost all i had: my bf and my friends and i dont know how to forget and go on with my life. I dont know what should i do at this point. i always feel the need to speak with him and get some explanation and this is frustrating. i cant let him go but at the same time i dont want him back.

She admits the same feelings and she then finally breaks up with Bob.  

Alice and I go to prom together, and we hang out over the summer.  I'm not sure if I was just bad at taking hints, or was too shy, or if she didn't want to, but it wasn't a very physical relationship.  Because of this, I thought she was more interested in being friends, so I took it in stride and didn't worry about it.  When it came time to head off to college, I thought ""Well, since she wasn't romantically interested, I guess meeting people in college won't pose an issue.""

I go off to school, and in the first week I meet this girl down the hall (I'll call her Eve).  Eve and I hung out increasingly, and our relationship pretty much consisted of us hanging out together, getting drunk, and hooking up.  The thing is, T had a boyfriend who was still in HS.  Neither Eve nor I ever told him about what was going on, but I was starting to feel weird with the situation.  I went looking for help, and who else seemed the best friend to ask about relationships where one person is in college and the other is a senior in HS than my friend Alice.  I told her all about it and asked for help and thought nothing of it.  Alice didn't give any advice, so I blundered through my increasingly complicated relationship with Eve for a few more months until she finally said ""I love you"".  I then told her, ""You can't love both me and your boyfriend"".  I felt like an asshole for giving her this ultimatum but I guess I secretly hoped she would pick me.  She didn't, of course, so who else should I go to for support but Alice.

Fast forward through an awkward semester of slowly distancing myself from T and I'm coming home from school.  Alice calls me up drunk one night, and we make plans to hang out over the summer.  A friend tells me that he's having a party, so I call up Alice and invite her.  At the party, we both get drunk and head off to a secluded spot.  She tells me that she wants me to take her virginity, but (and this is really difficult to write)  I don't know how to ""get it in"" so to speak (T would always help and I would always pass it off as being drunk).  Anyway, nothing happens that night, but I make plans with Alice to go see a movie later.  After the movie, Alice tells me that she's not really sure where we stand.  I'm not 100% sure if I understood what she said, but it was something along the lines of this:

* She had wanted our relationship to be more than just friends last summer
* She had thought of our relationship last summer as being more than just friends
* She got jealous of Eve and felt really hurt about my relationship with her
* She doesn't want to get hurt again when I go off to school this next year
* She feels weird that we almost hooked up at my friend's party

I'm not really sure what to do at this point.  I apologized to her for hurting her by telling her about Eve.  I had no idea that Alice thought that we were more than friends, and now I feel bad for hurting her, but I still want to hang out with Alice this summer.  I understand that maybe she doesn't want to hook up with me if I'm just going to head off to school again and meet another girl, but I still want to salvage our friendship.

My FMIL has not really cared for me at all, and in fact refused to acknowledge our relationship for the majority of it. We are looking for a house to start our life together, the market is good, were financially prepared, and we are being very responsible about it. 

Her mother has been despite disapproval, more or less cordial. She was well aware of our home search, so I assumed all was peachy. I was sufficiently incorrect. Apparently she wasn't aware that us looking for a house meant that my fiance would be moving out and we would be living together. That seems obvious to most people but alright, maybe we didn't communicate properly. I'm personally confused because we stay the night at each others places multiple times a week, so I wasn't expecting such an objection over our living together prior to being married.

Is there something else at play here? Why would she not be opposed to us sleeping together prior to marriage, but not having our own home? And how can I fix this, I don't want either of us to resent my MIL in the future, and I'm personally unwilling to put my plans on the back burner for such a trivial thing, but her mother is very important to my fiance. Anyone been in this position as well?

TL;DR: FMIL(50s) doesn't want me(25m) and fiance(25f) to live together before marriage, despite us spending the night together often for the past 3 years, and having not really brought this up before, and MIL not being religious.

OK, so the title is a bit inflammatory. I *hate* the idea of a relationship leash. But clearly the fact that I let my husband roam free is what got me made a fool of. So I have to figure out what accountability looks like, what verifying his claims of good behavior would look like, until I get to a point where I can believe it without receipts.

He's been cheating for like 6 months. I have known it for sure for MUCH much shorter of a time, but there've been red flags and suspicions for ages. He's been getting more and more reckless lately. They're all over each other on public streets; they're telling people that they're, like, dating, or whatever you call it when you have a wife at home. I know a lot. A LOT. But he doesn't know I know anything.

I'm still in the stage of figuring out what I want, when I confront him. Divorce or my husband back. He is my best friend, or he was until he treated me like this... I can't tell. And I still love him (even if I think I'm notactuallystupid, even if he clearly thinks I am from how much egregious shit he's pulled). So I'm trying to think through what each path would really look like.

And what I can't get past is, if I say I know everything and he says I'm so sorry I'll end it and I'll be good, how can I possibly trust that? At this point I honestly think he spends more time with her than with me. They ride into the city together for work (not the same job but located nearby); they get lunches together; they go to the gym together; they hang out together on evenings when either they invent work events or they actually have work events that they actually go to with each other as actual dates. 

When I say I don't (or didn't!) believe in a leash, I mean it. He gets home when he gets home. He goes out if he goes out. We both travel a bit for work or work-ish things (conferences, etc). And he's just taken advantage of that on like a near-daily basis. To say nothing of the constant texting and Facebooking he somehow thinks I haven't noticed. 

Obviously, assuming that adults who are married and who are friends will not abuse one another's trust isn't going to work anymore, at least through some period of rebuilding that trust. But what is the alternative, that doesn't turn me into a psycho stalker? I can't make him be home at 6 every day, or not travel periodically (his job doesn't work like that). I can't forbid him from going out in the evenings (he has &amp; deserves friends, although some of them have aided and abetted and I'd be JUST FINE with a leash that puts those assholes off-limits). I can't ban the internet for him (again, job) I can't go with him to the gym or to lunch every day or ride with him in the work to make sure there's not a woman in the car with his hand down her pants to start the day off with a smile. But how do I let him work late, or go on travel, or go to the gym, or see his friends, or basically use his car, computer, or phone, without losing my mind that he's pulling all the same shit? 

Understand I have NEVER worried about this stuff before. I am not a controlling type looking for an excuse to BE controlling. I am someone being eaten up by how much my trust was utterly shat on, and trying to envision if there is even a way I can get past that. Maybe the answer is no. I need to figure that out before I talk to a divorce lawyer. And I need to talk to one soon because I cannot bear pretending everything's great while I work through a plan here.

---

EDITED TO ADD SOME CONTEXT based on initial feedback: I'm *not* sure I want to stay. The reason I'm not asking divorce questions is just because I'm confident on how I'd proceed with that. This question is about envisioning what other options look like, if they even exist. FWIW, he's told her he wants to stay married to me. Also she is married too. I don't think her husband cares what she does, but I do think she cares about his bank account and possibly even her small children. // Also, repeating from paragraph 1: leash is a bit tongue-in-cheek. Really.

---

EDITED AGAIN: The tenor of the responses here vs. my those from my friends who know him is SO different, it's amazing. I'm thinking through what that means. I am sure that if I had read this post, not written it, my reply would also be nuke the site from orbit, it's the only way to be sure. But many of my friends who know him well, who've seen us be really good together because we *were*, seem to think he really does love me and is just living in some sort of lust-driven fugue state, out of which he will be shamed once he is disabused of the notion that I'm ignorant and unharmed here. I'm not saying they're right and folks here are wrong, but it's interesting to me that even on like Day One when I was like I am going to take every damn thing he has because how dare he, many of my friends (who are NOT doormats or traditional wives in ANY way) were taking a less vengeful view of things than I was. I dunno. Need to parse that out more, for sure.

9892,Dating,1vmsrb,"Just to clarify: I live in NYC. Most of my friends don't have cars, she doesn't have a car. I have friends who have never learned to drive. I have a good job and make enough money to live reasonably well. With that out of the way:

I'm relatively new to dating in general and very new to kissing (no excuse for that). It seems like when I see dates in movies or on TV, the man picks up the woman at her house, they go on the date, he takes her home, and the kiss seems to happen in the car once they get back to her house. 

The problem is, in MY life, it works like this: we meet at the restaurant or wherever we've arranged. I wait at the bar. She meets me, I give her a hug, we sit down across from each other. We have a nice conversation, eat, whatever, I pay for the meal, and I walk her back to the Subway. It seems like it would be pretty weird for me to take the Subway with her back to her house, and even then we'd be on the street. It just seems like there's no privacy.

Does anyone here have any tips on how to get in a kiss when there's no private time at the end of a date because you aren't driving? Should I just suggest going to a movie for the next one? How is this done?

Also worth mentioning: it's fricking freezing here. If it were summer, I could imagine suggesting a walk in the park or something, but that's not happening right now.

Her mother and father were never married, though she knew his identity, and that was just kind of status quo. Unfortunately, my mother was between her half-brothers in age, indicating infidelity within my grandfather's relationship with his wife. We met them once. It was lovely, and I learned I had cousins around my age (kind of a big deal since previously I thought both my parents were only children). We made some promises about introducing our faimlies to each other and then just...never saw them again. We found out he died a few years back, but no one told us or asked us to the funeral. Talk about a fucking blow. I had only met the man a few times, but he was in some way my granddad, if only because he explained my curly black hair and olive skin. But of course, it's more than that. In a family where there are NO records of marriages or births or names before my great-grandmother (including only 1 of her 5 husbands) , I want so badly to know where I came from. 

I found a group called (last name) cousins on facebook, and sure enough, a picture of my granddad and his brother, and all their children pop up. Well, almost all their children. There was even a picture of him in the navy, which I never knew he served in, and with his granddaughter, who even kind of looks like me. 

We were only contacted by 2 of the 4 kids (both ~50/M). Do I have a right to introduce myself by facebook or email, and to perhaps ask to meet or for family info about my grandfather's ancestry to be shared? It's worth noting that he was not a healthy man, and we are not a healthy family, and some of that info might be valuable to my mother's doctors, or mine in the future. 

If it is right, how do I go about it as politely as possible? What if they say 'no'? This is a big hole in my understanding about who I am. I don't even know if I want to have a relationship with them, but I'd like to have some photographs and info for my niece and my own children (should I ever have any).

I was in the same situation however I have more friends here from high school. At the end of last year I have a friend who is a guy who I decided I would room with in order to prevent another horrible random roommate assignment (he's friends with my bf and definitely not my type). Of course I asked my boyfriend and he was okay with it. Now skip toward the next semester, my boyfriend met some friends who were part of an international program and he really enjoyed himself. I was happy at first but got concerned when I realized he would always get crazy drunk with them all the time. Now I don't mind the drinking but often be wouldn't text me or let me know and id worry if he was okay or not. One of the people he met was not an international student and she is pretty but not threatening to me at all. I visited twice this semester and she seemed nice but they all seemed to spend a lot of time drinking my boyfriend'a alcohol and eating his food.

This is pretty much a deal breaker for me but he thinks that I'm crazy and a hypocrite. Since he doesn't think it's that big of a deal, he doesn't think ill break up with him over it.

99986,Breakups,3474z4,"Before I start, I just want to make it clear that I'm not trying to get back together with this guy. I'm just looking for advice on how to move on and how to not make the same awful mistakes. Sorry if this is a bit disorganized, it we broke up less than an hour ago and it's all come crashing down on me pretty fast. 

We started dating almost two and a half years ago. About six months into our relationship he cheated on me. From the start, this relationship was pretty much doomed to not work out. But for some reason, probably because I was stupid and believed I was already completely in love with him, I tried to forgive him and make it work. On his request, we tried being polyamorous for a short time. I wasn't happy, but I thought I wanted him more than anything, so I tried to deal with it and stay with him.

We fought a lot, then decided he had to break up with her and go back to being monogamous. For about a year after this, I had some pretty serious trust issues. I never intentionally told him not to do things with other girls, but I know I would get really upset with him and kind of guilt him into not doing the things he wanted. Looking back, our situation was pretty messed up and we should have ended things then.

Once he'd regained some of my trust, though, things were great. We had a wonderful, loving relationship. He was my first everything (from kissing to sex) so I guess it's no surprise that I got pretty attached to him. And that was fine, we loved each other and we were pretty much happy.

But then I got kind of... I'm not sure how to describe it, other than to say that I was emotionally manipulative. It was really bad. I'd get upset about something little, drag it out for days, making him apologize for whatever else he managed to do that upset me more. I'd constantly bring up things like how he cheated on me (evidently I hadn't forgiven him), things that happened ages ago and didn't affect anything now. And eventually we'd make up, I'd apologize, we'd say we loved each other and we never wanted to lose each other. 

So this breakup is entirely my fault. I'm fully aware of that. Of course, after months and months of being subjected to this, he got fed up with me and tried to break up with me. Of course I was devastated, missed school for a day and did nothing but mope around, but the next day when I went back I somehow convinced him things would change and it'd be better. And I really did mean it. I tried.

I went to a therapist to try to get my own issues worked out (anyone close to me seems to suspect I have anxiety issues and possibly depression), but the therapist pretty much ignored everything I said and focused on how my schoolwork was going. After four sessions with the therapist, in which I brought up these issues and he moved on to other topics without so much as acknowledging them, I decided to stop going. 

So nothing really changed. The worst part of this is I *still* acted like a total bitch, getting upset for nothing and just trying to get attention from him. Afterward, I'd realize what I'd done, and I'd try to apologize, but it didn't really mean much, even though I thought it did at the time. It would invariably happen again, and during one of these fights (which were pretty one-sided, just me getting upset over nothing) I always felt like I was justified. It's only after that I realized how stupid the fight had been.

So I should have seen this coming from a mile away. He broke up with me, again, and this time we're actually done. I understand completely why he wasn't happy, and to be honest, near the end I wasn't either and I was considering leaving him. We ended on pretty good terms, all things considered. We are not going no-contact, mostly because we were very close while we were together, best friends as well as romantic partners, really. Between the fights (which happened often-ish, once every couple months, more often than that recently), we were really close, really loved each other (I thought), and were really happy with each other (I also thought). We know pretty much everything about one another. So after our talk, we decided to try to stay friends, even though it probably won't work and it's likely we'll stop talking to each other completely. I'm going to note here that I'm not emotionally manipulative with any of my other close friends. I'm not sure why I was with him, and I need to figure out how to stop before I hurt someone else again.

I'm really just uncertain how to move on from something like this, being my first serious relationship. I still have other friends, of course, but there's a huge hole in my life now where I used to spend time with him. I know I was absolutely a shitty person throughout our relationship, which I'll attribute partly to being young and stupid, but I can't blame anyone but myself for this. How can I make sure I never hurt anyone like this again? I know I'll date other guys in the future, and I don't want to be manipulative, but since I don't realize when I'm doing it, I don't know how to stop myself.

6448,Breakups,1nzp9s,"After arriving at college my girlfriend and I broke up after dating for about 16 months.  We had always treated the relationship as a long-term endeavor however it became clear partway through that it would be difficult for things to last over the long-term.  We found ourselvIes no longer in love, despite still loving her as an individual.  However, until the beginning of September I never developed the heart to convince myself to consider ending things.  When we finally did I initiated but it was worked out mutually.  However, it felt like it killed her that we did so.  It hurt me just as much but I felt stuck in the role of comforting her and thus felt both heartbroken and terrible.  She was awfully upset for weeks as we tried to maintain a friendship and told me all these things about how she could never handle if I went after someone else, and wrote me heartfelt letters that damn near killed me.  I felt just as bad, and I wanted more than anything to stay in love and keep her happy but I couldn't control that I no longer was in a sustainable way.  A month later she has quickly gotten better, we have failed at being friends, and she flaunts her unofficial new man around.  I on the other hand have tried to avoid eating with women so that she won't see and be upset, tried repeatedly to maintain a good relationship, and stay out of her way at times (btw she lives in the same small dorm on my floor...) as she often tells me its too hard for her to see me.  I have felt like I have spent the last month accommodating my grieving ex-girlfriend, while I just shrivel up missing her, fell terrible and have no support.  Last night we had a huge fight like I never thought possible, and she still had no idea that I has been so hard for me to try and comfort her, and completely blames me for our inability to be friends.

We met 3.5 years ago. I'd just separated from a husband who left me for another woman. He'd just been dumped by a girlfriend of 4 years. We were both in a bad way, but found comfort in each other. We had a few one night stands which turned into a 2 week summer romance. We were infatuated. 

Then he had to leave to live 3+ hrs away for Uni. We should have ended things. It was clear we were just fulfilling each other's sense of loss, and we probably needed time single. Stupidly, we ignored that. We decided to give long distance a go. For a couple of weeks, we were still infatuated. Sending hundreds of texts a day, planning trips, etc. Then he met a new friendship group of students. 

He started the typical going out and drinking routine and I was hearing from him less and less. Three weeks after he'd left, he text me to tell me he'd had a one night stand with a course mate, Anna. I should have let him go. But I was weak, and pretty pathetic. I can see now I just craved his attention. I wanted someone who wanted me, so I forgave him and said we'd give things another go. 

The next year was tough. He withdrew and spent less and less time talking to me. I often didn't hear for days. I became clingy and jealous. With my ex husband's cheating and now his, I was a paranoid mess. I wish I'd had the strength to leave. I was always stalking his Facebook wall, looking at his female friends, terrified he was cheating again. I was always questioning him, which just made him withdraw more. A year after our relationship ended, I broke things off. I realised it was never going to be how it was in the beginning. 

Three weeks later, he got in contact. He missed me, and loved me and wanted to try again. He promised he'd be different and not neglect me. The weak idiot in me fell for it. I just wanted to be loved. I agreed to try again. To be fair to him, he did turn things around. He came to visit me more, was loving and attentive and we spoke all the time. My trust issues were still a problem, and a month after getting back together, I found myself snooping through his Facebook (which I know is terrible. I'm not proud). 

I discovered he'd cheated a second time during the first year, with a second girl, Becca. It looked like he'd slept with her once towards the end of our relationship and again when we broke up, before breaking things off with her. I confronted him, crushed and broken. I couldn't believe he'd lied. He'd slept with me without me knowing about the other girl. I felt dirty. 

I broke things off again. He got down on his knees and begged me, in tears, to reconsider. He told me over and over he loved me. He said he'd stop drinking, he'd visit me every weekend, he'd have counselling, do whatever it took. I said no. But we stayed in contact. I needed to know why he did what he did. I needed to know it wasn't because I wasn't enough for him. After a couple of sessions of counselling, he told me he thought he'd cheated because a) he was drunk and thoughtless and b) he wanted girls to want him. He felt rejected when his ex broke things off and was looking for a way to compensate. I accepted this. For some reason I even felt sorry for him. So I took him back. 

That was around 2.5 years ago. Since then, things have been no picnic. We've been in couples counselling, but not for all that long. My trust issues and his cheating have caused so many problems. For months I would question him about every detail of the cheating: what position? Did he like her body more than mine? Did she make him feel better than I did? I was also terrified he'd lie again. I questioned him over and over and over: Was there anything else? Any other lies I didn't know? Anything at all? He always said no. That there was nothing. 

Our unhealthy relationship dragged on. I was paranoid, checking his phone and facebook messages (gahhh, I know, I became a real psycho bitch). I'd question him about girls he worked with, ask how pretty they were. You're probably wondering why we carried on? I guess it's because, when we weren't dealing with the trust problem, things were amazing. The sex was great and plentiful, we were so loving towards each other, and we had so much fun just hanging out, being idiots together. He's like my best friend, and I love him more than anything. Sometime when he professes his love for me and talks about our future, marriage etc, he wells up. There is a lot of good between us. 

A year ago, we decided to live together. Before we moved in with one another, I HAD to be sure that there was nothing between. I told him I was scared he was still lying. He promised me there was nothing. **He took my hand and told me there was nothing, he couldn't lie to me, he couldn't let us move in together and start a life together with lies between us.** Then a month after I moved in he broke down and told me. He'd kissed a girl when we broke up, also, he'd lied about stopping smoking and was doing it behind my back. Even though these were tiny lies, the fact he'd been dishonest broke me. If he could be dishonest about small things, surely he could be dishonest about big things? I was terrified of him lying, all the time, despite him constantly reassuring me he wasn't. 

Somehow, through counselling, we muddled on. Recently we had a breakthrough in counselling. The reason he didn't admit those lies before I moved in was because he was terrified I'd scream and go psycho on him. Whenever I'd questioned him about the cheating and he'd told me details, or whenever I saw an innocent message from a girl on facebook, or whenever a new, pretty girl joined his office, I would cry and scream hysterically. He was terrified I'd leave him, so he just kept things hidden. I get it. It's still not right, but I get it. 

Recently, I changed my approach. I trusted for certain that he'd never cheat again. He's an open bottle with his phone and computer now, I'd know if he was hiding anything. Plus we're very intimate. I just know he wouldn't cheat again. But I do think he'd lie about smaller things, and the past. I knew that they only way to get him to be honest was to accept what he said gracefully and calmly. So the lies have been spilling out. 

**On Tuesday**, he admitted that he sometimes still smokes and tells me he hasn't (FYI - I don't care, we just made a pact to stop together, that's why he lied). He also admitted that he'd lied about some of the girls at his work, because he didn't want me to freak out that there were pretty. OK, fair enough. He had no obligation to tell me anyway. 

**On Wednesday** he admitted that when he went on a work trip to Tenerife, it wasn't him and 4 guys like he'd said, there were actually 30 uni students, many pretty girls who he spent time with (as well as the guys) while they were in bikinis in the pool together. He also admitted that sometimes he uses incognito mode to google glamour models or watch porn in case I go crazy. I get it. 

**On Thursday** he admitted that although he only slept with two girls when we were together, there was a third girl he kissed. 

**Tonight (Friday)** he admitted he actually kissed the girl he first slept with, Anna, one other time during our relationship. 

Each night he tells me something, I smile, thank him for telling me, react calmly and say we'll work through it. Then he smiles, cries and thanks me for not going crazy. He says he likes being able to tell me and then says there's nothing else, that everything is out in the open now. Then the next night there's more! In fact, he told me there was nothing else when I took him back 2.5 years ago! 

Despite this, when we aren't focusing on this issue, there's still so much love between us. He wrote me a letter today telling me how much he loves me and how deeply sorry he is for all the hurt he's caused me. So much love, but not a scrap of trust. I don't know if I'm ever going to believe that everything is out in the open. How do I do that? Really? 

Also, I get that I was a crazy biatch and terrified him into lying, but I'm struggling to understand how he could keep it all this time? Letting me move in with him? Being so loving and reassuring throughout our relationship that ""there's nothing else, I promise, I couldn't do that to you...."". Clearly he could! Is he just that callous? I mean, sometimes he would CRY because I wouldn't believe he'd told me the truth about everything. But... he hadn't! 

Honestly, is there anything at all we can do?

We've been dating for over a year now and we get a long really well, I really am in love with her. I honestly can't imagine myself with anyone else. We are really happy together and we rarely ever fight.

However, she can get extremely jealous of other girls. It doesn't matter who the girl is, it could be a random waitress or someone I knew in high school, but she gets jealous if any other girls talk to me. She'll ask me tons of questions like ""Who is she?"" ""How do you know her?"" and ""Do you think she's pretty?"" as soon as possible and then will instantly say that she doesn't like this girl. She assumes that any girl I talk to I am instantly interested in and doesn't want me to speak to them. She suffers from anxiety and constantly worries about things, and I don't want to upset her, so I found myself losing female friends and avoiding making new ones so she won't get jealous. She knows she can get jealous and I always assure her she has nothing to worry about, but she doesn't get it. She will also claim she is just joking when she acts jealous but I don't think she is at all.

I don't think this girl is interested in me at all and just wants to be friends. So when I texted her and just had a friendly conversation with this girl, mentioned it in passing to my girlfriend. She expectedly got upset and demanded to know who she was and what she wanted by texting me. I don't have anything to hide and I didn't want to get my girlfriend jealous so I showed her the text messages. I reassured her there was nothing wrong and I'm not interested in anyone else and she seemed to believe me and was ok with it. But the next day, my girlfriend texted me and said she's not comfortable with this girl texting me and wanted me to stop. I told her that's fine and I would stop, but at the same time, I feel bad/weird ignoring my new friend just because she is a girl. I'm not sending flirty messages to anyone and I was just talking to someone I thought was nice to me. I can understand if I was blowing my girlfriend off or texting this girl while I was hanging out with my girlfriend, but I'm not doing that at all.

I ""knew"" this girl for 6 years, of that 6 years we have been together for one year. Just as we were getting in to the relationship she told me that one night at a party she took only one or two glasses of alcohol and found her self in the bed naked, she pissed herself and puked all over herself. She said that she ""slept"" with this one guy but she wasn't sure. I took this really wrong, part of it has thanks that she told this story trough laughter and with weird grin on her face. She told me that that guy was her best friends boyfriend and that he was in love with her. I couldn't listen to this, I was angry as I could get. I thought about betting this guy, but she told not to do anything, that she left that in past. I asked her what did she do after that, seeing that was her best friends boyfriend and all, she told me that her friend is angry at her and called her a whore for doing this. After that conversation I went into shock. I hit me like a truck. I went on medications, started seeing shrinks, I just couldn't cope with that information and pictures my brain started to project on me. I tried to be her comfort in that situation as best I could. But she didn't want to talk about it, she said that that were bad times for her and that she was in a depression for a long time, because that girl was like a sister to her. I tried to get number from that guy to see what he has to say but she wouldn't let me, I tried to talk to her friend to see what she has to say but she didn't let me, and that was killing me. I had most disgusting  pictures in my mind and I thought that knowing more would help me and would be at peace if I could also put this thing behind me, but she didn't want to talk about it.She saw that I was devastated, taking antidepressants, seeing shrinks crying most of the time, that I lost 20 pounds, didn't speak at all and she knew that that wasnt me. That before that I was the happy guy, always making jokes, cheering every body. And I wanted was to know everything about that night and everything that happen, but she said that was all  and it was better to leave it that way.

She told me that she misses her, I couldn't believe that. How could you miss someone who is in a relationship with a guy who you said put something in your drink and took advantage of you? I found out she was texting and that they were arranging to meet and have a few drinks and talk for hours just like old times. Dont get me wrong I know how much you can miss your best friend but this was just a knife in my back. I confronted her, and she said that she didnt talk to her and didnt say that she wants to meet witht her until I showed her the evidence, than she admitted, I should have left her right over there, but as I said I wasnt a stable person, I couldt make my self to do anything so I just forgave her. 

After some time one of her friends saw the state I was in and told me to confront her again and to say to her that I now know everything, so I did. And she finally cracked and came open, and told me that she slept with this guy one more time after that incident and she was in contact with him after that night for some time. And that was it, something strange happened, I felt like one tone was removed from my back at that moment I yelled at her, screamed but somehow I was relieved and broke up with her. She begged me to get back together, and that she was scared to tell me that she slept with him after that. I still don't know why would someone tell to their boyfriend about her first sex with that guy, that was like rape, and keep seeing your boyfriend slowly fade in to darkness and not about a second time. She was single she can do what she wants I wouldn't be mad at her, but she kept that information silent, the information that later as I now see brought me back to life.

My Ex of 3 years, is now in an abusive relationship, and her BF has her addicted to his methadone he gets from the clinic.
 
Let me start by saying, me and her relationship was not perfect, she cheated on me with her ex a few times, we broke up a lot, and she still had a pill problem (xanax at most). 
 
She grew up without a father, and has had a lot of sexual partners, but I was young, and I seen good in her.. I still do despite what others say. Maybe I am delusional.
 
Anyways we broke up a year ago, I made her pack up her things and leave, I had no job, and It was apparent she was about to leave me (again). She then went back with her ex, and eventually to the new guy. She tried to speak to me 1 last year, I was nice but mostly blew it off. I heard she was getting engaged, good for her. Until recently, I started hanging out with her brother (which happens to be my life long best friend) and he has informed me that she is not doing good.
 
She is not allowed at her moms house, she has had the cops called on her and her bf for abuse, but she denied it. Her brother has tried to beat the shit out of her BF for it, he hides, she defends him (her and her brother were very very close, and for her to actually hit on her brother to defend the new BF is ridiculous). Her mom is dead set on doing the same.. maybe a bit more intensely. Then he also informs me that he has her addicted the Methadone, and she has wrecked 2 cars from being so fucked up on it, and is about to lose her job. 
 
This makes me sick, very sick to my stomach. I cant help but care about her, and just recently lost my father, and I do not want to lose another person I care about.
 
I know she used me, I don't know if she really loved me as much as I did her, but I know she has a good heart, and she uses drugs, and sex as a instant but short gratification to deal with her bigger problems.

Or she really just likes it, and im wasting my time..

I dont know what to do, If she contacts me I have no way to know her true intentions, I recently got a new car, went back to school and graduated, got a good job, I have my own place, and am currently in college, all within this year, so I cannot know if she really just wants money, but I do not want to be mean, for if she hurt herself I couldn't live with the guilt.

113832,Relationships,255tmf,"We have been together for almost two years and were extremely close friends for two years before that. She is literally perfect and while I have had my fair share of relationships, I never would have imagined someone caring about me like she does. The only problem is that it scares us to want to spend the rest of our lives together when we are both still so young. We joke all the time about wishing we had stayed friends until later in life so that we could settle down already. We both have known for a long time that we want to be in each other’s lives until the end, as friends or more. But we just got to the point where we couldn’t restrain ourselves anymore. 

Anyway, in a week we will both be graduating from University. We are spending the summer together in the mountains working and saving money. In the fall we are planning on traveling, some of the time together and some of it apart before we both head back to the city to start our careers. When we get back, neither of us will have places to stay and the most logical decision (financially and logistically) would be to get an apartment together. But considering our relationship and hopes for the future, we are scared that getting an apartment together will lead to us settling down too early and maybe ruining our relationship. We have talked about this a lot and have basically decided to get separate apartments with other friends but we keep having doubts, as we really both want to live together. So I’d just like an outsider’s opinion: are we making the right decision by playing it safe? Or are we just letting fear get the better of us?

76494,Dating,3e620b,"Hey everyone! So I'm a little nervous about posting on here but I have seen so much support and helpful advice from this community that I thought I would reach out.


I am about to start my senior year of undergrad this year and I am dating someone for the first time since I have been in college. My only other relationship was in high school so it's been about 4 years I have been single.


I have had fibromyalgia for about four years now which is a chronic pain disorder. In a nutshell I'm in a lot of physical pain every day and also suffer from chronic fatigue, migraines, and some other symptoms. Part of the reason I have not dated anyone is that I find it really hard to have a social life because I spend a lot of time feeling sick and in bed. That combined with being in college has made my dating life pretty much nonexistent. 


I finally met someone about three months ago that I really like. I'll call him Chad. We have been dating for about three weeks but I have not yet told him about my fibromyalgia. We have spent a good amount of time talking and have kissed a few times but nothing has progressed past that. I have been rather reserved about getting too physical or spending too much time together because I get tired about super easily so I usually find an excuse to cut our dates short and go home because I don't feel well. I am also very nervous about having sex because it can be a very painful and exhausting experience for me because of the fibromyalgia. I also do not often have a sex drive because of the pain medication that I am on.


I think that Chad has perceived my behavior as me not being interested or attracted to him. I have told him that I find him attractive and I have been very flirty when I do spend time with him but I always cut it off before anything goes too far. I know that he is attracted to me and definitely want to have sex as we have talked about it and done some mild sexting. I also know that he wants a serious relationship and not just a hookup or something causal. However, I am worried that he will not want to date me if he knows that our relationship will likely not involve a lot of sex and that I am often so sick. I also don't know how to bring this up and tell him about it.


I'm not sure if I'm leaving out any important details but I'm willing to answer anything I may have left out. I guess I'm looking for advice on how to tell Chad about this and maybe advice from anyone who has a chronic illness or has dated someone with a chronic illness.

93805,Dating,2hgxvx,"Girlfriend of 5 months identifies as bisexual and I've known this since before we started dating. We ended up losing our virginities to each other about 2 months ago. She seems fairly into the sex and the relationship, but has told me that I am literally the only guy that she would ever consider sex with. She doesn't find other men appealing in the least, but is very attracted to women. She exclusively enjoys watching lesbian porn, especially before we have sex.

Now when we started dating I wasn't exactly the ""manliest of men"". For all purposes I had a somewhat slender and had a ""feminine"" figure. For the past month or so though I have been working out quite a bit and my girlfriend has been pretty opposed to me ""bulking up"".

I'm her first and only real relationship. She has fooled around a bit in the past with guys and girls, but has only been in one significant relationship with a guy (me) and none with a girl. I'm beginning to think that she may actually be more of a lesbian than a bisexual and that she may be happier in a relationship with another woman. I've been looking for ways to broach the subject. It's still fairly early in the relationship (by my standards) and I would rather not have this pop up way down the line (like 2 years) when she realizes that she should have been in a lesbian relationship all along.

140756,Relationships,2s36qi,"Me and this girl have been talking for around 6 months, we see each other whenever we can, and we're always in touch when she's at Uni. Recently, she returned home for Christmas, and I messed up a bit. I kept sending her messages to check she was okay, as she'd many horrible things happen when she returned and I wanted to be there, but, in hindsight, I must have sounded pathetic always hoping that she's not stressing herself out too much. I was stressed myself, I'm a professional musician, and my work was getting to me a bit, making me act in that manner. From what she messaged me, she understood completely and wanted a bit of space, that was fine, I didn't want her to mess up her Uni work, or to end up resenting me for taking her focus away from the things that mattered.

Basically, when she apologised for sounding rude in an early message on Thursday and explained how she's so busy, I told her that was fine, I wanted her to do her best and succeed in what she was doing, and I had an audition, so I understood her completely.

Today, it turned out that, for some reason or another, she hadn't received the message, and sent me one saying that she'd had enough of the silent treatment. I sent the message once more, to prove that I had, and she still didn't apologise for jumping to conclusions, or accept that I had sent it, and she's disappeared again, leaving me wondering what's happening.

I'm confused, everyone around me is saying that I'm being messed around, that she should find time for me, and she definitely should know that I wouldn't 'give her the silent treatment'. The problem is, I really care about her, and feel like I'm doing everything wrong all the time, I always do. I feel like I'm losing who I am because I'm always wondering how she is, if I've done the wrong thing, but I know I will always come back whenever she gets back in touch. I don't know if it's possible for everything to be okay, but I'm battling my way through praying that we can be happy, but that's doing nothing for my health.

I know this is only her bad side, we all have one, and we've had amazing times together before, but there's just something in my head that's shaking me and telling me that if her bad side is making me feel like this, it's not worth it, but everything else tells me that all this is my fault and if I work hard I can fix it, and I really don't know what to think.

I am in medical school, and she is also in law school. This may make me sound like a douchebag, but there is just this disconnect there intellectually. Her being in law school immediately might imply to you that she must be at least somewhat smart. And she IS relatively book smart.  However, I still feel that there is a depth to intelligence that doesn't only include learning from books.  She has exactly ZERO emotional/interpersonal intelligence. She blurts out whatever's on her mind, never can understand social contexts, lets people take advantage of her (doing lots of favors for people, etc.), and she lets people walk all over her, and expects favors in return when she does something for someone else (stupid).


There is also a lack of general intelligence about the world, wanting to know and learn anything outside of what she has to. I feel like I can't talk to her about anything in depth because she doesn't get it, or doesn't want to. Politics, sports, philosophy, economics, religion, world news, history, science, etc., etc.  She is fine with learning about textbook material, and gets decent grades, but she has no interest in pushing herself intellectually and that is literally what I do FOR FUN.  I read history, I keep up with world politics, sports, and film. I KNOW this sounds extremely douchey, the whole I'm smarter than you are bit.  I'm no genius.  I'm not pushing IQ's or test scores. I like to think I'm a pretty nice person, and I'm not someone who goes out of his way to let the world know that I am knowledgeable.  I'm more of the guy who enjoys getting a bunch of stuff right on Jeopardy and talking shit to the contestants through my TV.


I feel like shit sometimes because she has no interest in any of that, and would rather lose herself in a rotten sitcom than open up a book and learn something new, and is completely unable to discuss anything that isn't related to her interpersonal relationships or what type of cheese she just ate (she loves cheese). 

Please understand, after all that, she is generally a very caring, hard-working, kind, honest, and attractive girl.  I love her very much, and we connect very well on an emotional level.  I would say that outside of this intelligence thing, we have a wonderful relationship. But her sometimes complete lack of intelligence and boneheaded decision-making are just baffling to me.  I have told her on several occasions that I wish she would keep up on more things, but I fear that her upbringing and interests differ too much from that.

(20 minutes north of our house, about 25 minutes from the college). this is extremely frustrating to me because i take all online college courses so i just sit around waiting for her classes to end. no gas money or even a thank you has ever been provided to me. if ever i have a proctored exam or something like that and i can't take my sister to school, my mom acts as if ive ruined her whole life due to the rearranged gym schedule.

She would call me constantly after we broke up (saying she was going to visit me, send me care packages etc) for about 2 weeks and then nothing. 

Anyways, I called her today because I might be moving back to the area earlier than expected and was interested in building back up our relationship. We had a nice talk and then she asked if I was dating I told her no (and told her about a bad dating story) then she told me she had been dating someone and trying long distance with them (she interned over summer about 6 hours from our college and he worked at that company). I asked her how long after she broke up with me and she said 2 weeks. She told me they haven't had sex and that they met after we broke up. She also told me how great he is and how she was instantly obsessed with him and how he's an engineer and how he's so outgoing and how she enjoys being around him.

92099,Relationships,1ijm33,"I met my best friend nearly ten years ago. She was 27, and I was 19. We worked for the same company, though we were in different departments. She was intelligent, driven, and focused. Quite literally everything that I wanted to be ""when I grew up."" 

Before too long we became roomates. Our mutual friends referrred to us as ""Batman and Robin."" We had many similar beliefs and interests. She helped me through my mother's breast cancer, my father's alcoholism, and through two suicide attempts in my family. There was nobody I respected more than her. 

In time, however, I began to notice that she had an outrageous temper. Many times, other friends would mention to me that they thought she was controlling and possessive of me. 

I grew up in a very unstable household, though, so I brushed it off as relatively normal behavior. Sometimes it was tough to deal with, but I was the only person that ""got"" her. 

Fast forward a few years: I found myself in an abusive relationship at 23. I moved out of our shared house and in with my boyfriend. Though I made it through, it cost me my friendship with her. She just watched me crash and burn. 

I actively avoided ever seeing her for about a year- not an easy feat in a town of less than three thousand people. In that time, I found that I didn't really miss the tumultuous time that she and I had together. We eventually reconnected, and for a while everything was great. I stayed with her for a month before moving overseas, and it was like a long vacation. No stress, and no worries, aside from the occasional issue with her family. 

After several years, I returned to the united states and moved back to my home town. She got me a job at the same place that she worked, and My son and I moved back in with her temporarily, while my husband was attending school a few hundred miles away.

I felt as if I hade made a mistake the first morning that I woke up there. My husband had stayed the night, and accidentally let her dogs out unattended, after which they promptly went for a romp and ended up being gone all night. I spent the entire morning and anxious mess because I was afraid she'd blow up at my husband, leaving me to choose between them, and I felt that I had no place else to go. 

Things began to get fairly stressful at work. I am in the service industry in a tourist town. Summers are awful, and we are understaffed, which stresses everyone out. Before long, I was the target of muttered complaints from her, that turned into vocal criticism right in front of customers. On several occasions, customers mentioned to me that the way I was being treated at work wasn't right. 

I am a grown woman, and nobody's doormat. I told my friend how I felt about the way that I was being treated by her. Her response wasn't an apology, but a statement that she would be nicer to me if I stopped making so many mistakes. 

Two weeks ago, she walked into work, noted that I was distracted, and told me that she didn't want to have ""one of those kinds of days.""  I was going too slowly, though I hadn't made any mistakes that morning. 
The shift culmintaed with her throwing things at me. 

She of course apologized, and I accepted.

Three days ago, she got on me for moving too fast at work...I was invading her space, apparently. Then she told me that I was being ""dismissive"" of some of our best customers. If there's one thing that I know about myself as a professional, it's that I ace customer service all the time. 

I know she is tired and stressed out, and that there is a lot going on in her life, but I feel as if nothing that I can do is right. I won't have a verbal confrontation in front of customers, but I don't feel comfortable confronting her about her behavior outside of work either. 

I know I messed up by agreeing to work with her, but I feel like I can't back out. There are three people doing what is normally the job of five or six, and she is trying to buy the business. I don't want to leave her hanging. I really do care about her and want her to succeed.

We have also grown more apart in our worldview...I have moderated a bit over the last few years, and she has grown more conservative. I have married and had a child, and she is still single and working the same way she did when we were young...something that I'm not interested in doing anymore. I'd rather be with my family. 

I have found that she is unforgiving in her judgement of people, and vicious in the way she expresses it. So much so, that sometimes it makes me uncomfortable. She's taken an overzealous dislike to my mother-in-law, who is annoying, but kind, and not nearly as manipulative as my friend seems to think. She constantly talks about the people that she dislikes...so much vitriol. It's exhausting to even think about it. 

Looking back on all this, it seems like a pretty one-sided friendship in a lot of ways. I feel like I've put myself in a position where I might have to hurt somebody that I care about, or risk my own mental health. I honestly don't know what to do. I've talked about her behavior once with her already...I don't feel like I should have to do it again.

87422,Breakups,2ong3m,"so about a week ago, a girl I liked posted a picture with her and her boyfriend for the first time.

so heres a little backstory. I met this girl when I was on co-op which started at the beginning of this year. A few weeks into my job, I started to have feelings for this girl. She was cute, funny, friendly, pretty and smart. Just to give you guys a heads up, I have never dated before so falling for a girl comes quickly to me even though I do not know them quite well. And I don't have many female friends so the things she did for me were mistaken for signs (she would bump into me when we walked, sometimes grab my hand if she wanted to talk, to sum it up; more body contact then im used to) instead of friendliness which I found out later when I hung out with her guy friend. With all these reasons, I tried asking her out indirectly to see if she wanted to go bowling with me and my friends. However, she politely declined. As we spent more time eatting lunches together, I soon found out she had a boyfriend. My heart sank and I felt angry and sad. That night, I drank to the point which almost got me arrested. From that day on, I felt like if I didn't get over this girl I could hurt myself real bad. I gave no thought of asking her again but as our work lives continued and as I continued to see her everyday, I couldn't let my eyes off her.

so jumping to present time after our co-op was finished, I still kept in contact with her. I would message her on facebook and she would reply but she would never take the initative to message me. In the times that we do talk, it felt like I was trying to flirt with her. I felt like I still had a chance since there is not a single picture of her and her boyfriend on any of her social media. However, reality hits when she posts a picture with her and her bf for the first time which happened a week ago.

now i am sad as fk once again and the only way I can see myself happy is to get over her which I am having trouble doing. I am here to ask you guys for advice on how to get over this girl. Should I stop all contact with her? I mean how can you still talk with a person you like but has a boyfriend without feeling depressed and sad? And when i feel like that I can do some really stupid sht which I have already done once.

tl;dr - crush posts a pic with her and her bf for the first time. feeling sad. how to get over it?

Obv, he dated during the past 10 years, but one relationship was pretty serious. They dating off/on for 2 years, and were really close friends. They stopped talking when we started dating, because she always suspected him of having feelings for me. She was a sore spot for me as well. I had recently gained a lot of weight from meds I was on, and she was super in shape. She usually has her face all done up too, and always looks really pretty. Very 1950's. Meanwhile, I am still trying to master liquid eyeliner. 

I am currently trying to get my self-esteem in order by losing weight [down 27 lbs so far] &amp; I am back in school after a 3y break. Everything in our relationship is perfect, but I still cannot stop obsessing over her. I check her facebook and instagram almost daily like a sick fiend trying to see how pretty she looks. It's pretty sick when I think about the motivation behind my ""seeking"" - it's almost masochistic. 

We have had countless fights over my insecurities. He doesn't want to hear about her anymore, yet I stupidly bring her up! I have been good about it over the past few months though. Maybe once a month, but STILL anything more than zero is too much in this situation. 

I want to allow myself to be happy. We have a great relationship. We are best friends, and I want this insecurity to end for good. I hate looking at her pictures, I hate delving into the sick, low self-esteem part of me. I hate feeding that negativity in my mind. It feels like an addiction. An addiction to find something that will make me unhappy, make me feel lower about myself.

She started causing fights towards the end, I was getting acclimated to new medicine, we decided to mutually take a break for a bit, she took it as a breakup. 

That was in November, and I haven't been with anyone since her. We did not have mutual friends, and my friends did not like her, they told me this and my ex also hated my friends. Since the breakup, I've had two of her recent ex's message me randomly trying to start drama, and or tell me I should get her back because she talks about me often. I just ignored and blocked, I don't want to start or get into drama, because I'm still getting over the relationship, and losing her. Both went NC, she blocked me on everything months ago. 

A couple of my friends I've noticed still have her added, as I see her commenting on their photos. I had been friends with another girl for 6 years now, that goes to the same college as her, we all went to the same highschool, but they didn't know eachother. A few months after our breakup, I was moving on and talking to this friend, and hanging out. She was cute and funny and I loved to talk and hangout with her. My ex messaged me during this time asking for her stuff back, that she had left at my house, and she was visiting home from college. I dropped it off, had a small conversation, stupidly I told her about my friend, and she told me she never really liked her. We part ways again, NC. 

She starts drama soon after, telling everyone who will listen that I harass &amp; stalk her, I'm a big creep and I lie about everything. Like went out of her way telling people this massive lie about me, that really hurt because I would never do that to her, and it really was the best relationship I've had and I wouldn't belittle it. 


My friend and I arent dating now, we had a small fling but we are still friends. Now I see that my ex actively became friends with her, shes in all her photos, snapchat always hanging out.

Should I just stop being friends with them? I've talked to them about it, they know everything she did to me, about all her lies and they don't say anything about it, they like her now. I can't tell if she did this to get at me, which shes done with other things for no reason but to hurt me. 

Should just mention, I had a tumblr blog for years, I started getting hate anon messages so I got a tracker that tells me the location - City/State/Country of whoever opens my blog.

Before I deleted it months ago I came across my ex, and stupidly I just liked her.

52282,Relationships,2hbr3t,"For the past 2-3 years, I have known this girl from my school and we originally did not get on, but overtime we started to become friends. This girl is naturally flirtatious and I guess a bit of a tease, but around me she does it about 10 time more than any other guy. It mostly began, because at the time I was pretty awkward around girls and at that point she did it in front of her current boyfriend who was also a friend of mine. Then, I knew it was just for fun. Fast forward a year and she is still doing this, despite the fact she is not going out with my friend any more and therefore do not have as much contact with me as a friend. It had gotten to the point where she would literally rub herself against me or be as close as possible to me, supposedly to make me feel awkward. By this point I had come out of my awkward with girls phase and I actually was flirting with her as well ( just a little though). 

My friend who I had known since I was about 8 ( he had come out as gay about a year prior) even began to 'ship' us ( I hate that term -_-). We both just joked about this though. The problem is that I think both of us knew a relationship would never work, because we have the opposite personalities; she was outgoing, liked trashy TV, went shopping etc etc, whereas I am your typical Nerd : reclusive, plays Video games, spends time studying, although I do have a good body and take regular exercise. I knew that if a relationship were ever to occur it would most likely be simply a friends-with-benefits relationship. 

Fast forward another 6-8 months and we have both left school and have gone to our respective six-forms and had little to no contact. She has to my knowledge come out of a relationship. Basically the whole story comes down to about 4 days ago I made a post on FB with my first profile pic (new to facebook, only signed up to keep in contact with old friends). Anyway, she is the first to respond with: U literally just burst my ovarys u sexy beast xoxoxo of course this makes me feel a little weird at first, but I play along (flirt back at her) and it gets to the point where we joke about playing strip poker with her last message being: I don't brake promises ;) ;) when I ask if she’ll stay true to that side of the bargain. 

Now, the problem I am having is that I feel as if both of us still have an attraction to each other, but are too uneasy to actually act upon them. I even described the event to one of my friends who was confused as to what was going as: a game of chicken but instead the car is sex. Since Monday, which was the last time she commented, I have been debating whether to act upon this theory of mutual attraction. I still stand by the idea that us as a romantic relationship would not work, but am leaning more towards the idea of us being a friends-with-benefits relationship. I just don’t know whether I am reading too far into this or am actually right and she is just waiting for me to make the first move. Also, if I should act, then what should I say; how exactly am I supposed to propose that I think we should become friends with benefits without sounding like an utter creep.

Came back to break up with me and left again. Left me heartbroken. Posted a picture of this guy with his arm around her grabbing her boob... On my birthday. 

Me being the mature adult verbally abused her via text and sent the picture to her mom. Needless to say she is never going back to hawaii. 

I was no saint. I was rolling face off molly and this lesbian let me touch up on her... Like you would a cat... But no grabbing or kissing. That was it though! She would be letting this guy walk her home at 2am and then say ""its really dangerous in waikiki and hes just a friend"" like whoaa resturant closes at 1030. How the fuck are you getting home at 2 am? Yknow what i mean? But yeah we were fighting a lot but would still tell each other i love you every night.

This entire time after she broke up with me and even now she has never spoken a word. Honestly i became a wimpy dude who was looking for her approval. 

I went through depression and everything. But then i realized dude im a good looking smart funny guy. Soon as this happened i started talking to more girls and now am talking/sleeping with 3-4 girls. Ill leave it to your imagination. 

But i miss my ex. She was my first love after all. Im happy. No really like im happier than i have been in a long time But she never spoke a word. Nothing. 

Did she even love me? They say the way to murder someones soul is to tell them you love them and never talk to them again. She did love me though i know she did. How can she be so emotionally stable at 19. There is no way. 

I just want one conversation with her. Should i show up at her door? Or is that like border-lining crazy stalkerish? Should i talk to her mom? Should i just leave her alone? I think i should. But its always bugging me... 

HOW? How can she not talk to me after shes told me everything. I know her better than her best friend. 

I waited a full month of no contact. And started with ""hey"" no response... Waited a few days sent her a couple more ""itd be nice to hear from you"" crap. Then i left her a voicemail saying i was doing better and talking to someone. 

THE NEXT DAY she unblocked me on snapchat and posted a video of her new dude half naked on the couch with her... TO HER STORY... Then i texted her thats not classy and unattractive... No response. Then she posted the pick of the dude grabbing her boob on instagram... On my birthday. And then you know what happened after that. 

So shes back from hawaii. She will probably delete that picture because lets be real she looks like a slut and bad boys are fun for a short while. 

What should i do though? Ive gotten hardcore revenge. Hawaii was her favorite place ever and now her parents will never send her back. 

I feel bad but hey play with fire you sure to get burned. But even then... No call of her cursing me out or calling me an asshole. Nothing. Zip. Nada. Lol always wanted to use those words in that order... Anyway what do you guys think. 

Im not pressed obsessed or any other thing that suggests im emotionally unstable... Anymore. I was though. I just want one talk. The weird part is i havent even thought about the guy.

About 2 years ago I started to get reservations about our relationship. I still loved him very much but ended it. He didn't do anything ""wrong"", it was just a matter of our relationship no longer being what I wanted. 

While we were broken up I started seeing another guy, call him Max. He knew I had just come out of a LTR and so we kept it casual. But we completely clicked on every level. In particular we had amazing, mind blowing sex, unlike anything I had experienced before (mind you, I had experienced very little at all).

Anyways, I realized over time that no matter how great this new thing was, I loved Tom. And I came to the conclusion that I needed to try and make that relationship work. 

So Tom and I have been together again for over a year, working on some issues and generally strengthening our relationship. I am slightly happier than I was before but still have reservations. And one reservation in particular that I want advice on: sex. 

I constantly think about what it was like with Max (not so much because I want to be with Max, but because I know I'm missing something in my current sexual life with Tom). I try and block it out, think about other things, but keep coming back to what I am missing. I should also mention that this isn't a case of our sex life dwindling because we have been together for so long. Rather, I have never really enjoyed having sex with Tom. I was content with this before (thought maybe I just had a low sex drive) and mostly focused on the fact that I derived pleasure from Tom's pleasure and so accepted that that would be my prime motivation or sex. But now I've experienced something great and realize that is totally fucked.

I've recently realized that one of the reasons I loved being with Max was that I had no inhibitions and so our sexual relationship was freeing and exciting and playful. With Tom I feel uncomfortable, reserved and awkward. I want to get over this because I love Tom and want our sex life to be great. And he clearly also wants it to be better. I'm not sure why I feel this way about Tom. I trust him completely and so I don't know where the discomfort comes form. And he has never done anything to make me feel like I couldn't ""let loose"". My only hypothesis is that we got together when we were so young that I haven't been able to shake my timid sexual self that existed when we first met.

73257,Breakups,3e7rqg,"Alright this is a very long story. My ex was the first girl I dated, and loved. Sure there had been those primary school feelings and relationships that doesnt last more than 1 month, but in this particular relationship I loved her, and I know that for a fact because right after she dumped me(saying she lost her interest), my life feels horrible. Before we broke up, we were in love for 16 months, I was so happy. But when I was so into the relationship, I prioritized myself over her most of the time. At one point of the relationship she started to become very close to my best friend, chatting with him so much to the point that I got very jealous and emotional that I made her stopped talking to him.

A month passed after that, she started to talk to him again, I got angry this time, which was a mistake I regret every since. I got angry, we got into a fight, then at the end of the conversation she says that she doesnt want to be with me any longer, and despite how angry I was at the start of the conversation, I broke down and realised that I made a mistake. I apologized and everything but she told me she lost her feelings and really wanted a break up.

A few days after that, I got really emotional again, I talked to my best friend, telling him how I felt and everything but instead we got into a fight and then we stopped talking for a while until things got better. I decided to then use the no-contact rule I searched up on the internet on my ex. I waited, 30 days, nothing, she really doesnt want to talk to me. I feel depressed but I felt that I really want HER to be the first one to text me. So I waited, another month, 60 days now, ok, I feel extremely depressed at this point, I wanted to text her on whatsapp but Im blocked, I wanted to text her so many times but I stopped myself, until my birthday. She texted and greeted me saying happy birthday and I replied thank you, didnt expected you to text me but I really appreciated it. And that was the end of the conversation. Was that all Ive been waiting for? for a short 2 sentence conversation? And all that time I waited for her to text me, I stalked her instagram account seeing how happy she is, and also seeing her with my best friend, Ive never felt so depressed in my life. 

Fast forward to yesterday afternoon, I decided that I should start the conversation after our conversation died during my birthday(June 21). I started the conversation with a positive attitude, asking how are you and normal stuff like that. I received a positive reply as well, and the conversation kept going until it eventually died today, ending with short worded sentences and conversation topics that doesnt last. Right now, currently, I've been ignored by her, she read my text but didnt replied.

**Back story:**

My mom has always been a very volatile force in my life. She was always prone to full-blown screaming fits directed at me for as long as I could remember. Literally, if I ""looked at her wrong"" at any moment, she would corner and berate me at the top of her lungs. She could never hold down a job. She would compete with me very obviously in weight loss and appearance-related things. When I was a teenager, she made a habit of taking the cash that I would save at home, use it for bills and then when I found out, would accuse me of not caring about the family enough. On two separate occasions, she also stole my checks and forged my signature to cover various bills. This amounted to a few hundred each time.

______________________________________________________________________________________________________

**Addiction:**

Three years ago, she confessed to being an alcoholic and closeted drug addict (pain pills). Went to outpatient rehab, started NA, etc. She made a half-assed attempt at apologizing for these various things. She also amassed a large, anonymous group of ex- and current addict friends through NA that she would go out with every day until the wee hours of the night.

______________________________________________________________________________________________________

**Ditched Our Family:**

Two years ago, she sent me an FB message telling me that she left my dad and wouldn't tell me where or with whom she would be living. I knew they weren't happy but this was so unexpected that it hit me like a truck. The day before, she had made plans to come see me at college with my dad the following week. I found out later she left my dad by sending him a text that morning telling him he that she wasn't coming home and then never came home.

______________________________________________________________________________________________________

**Now:**
 
We've been in limbo. I've seen her once in person at my college graduation in the last two years. She shellacs every interaction we have with a very false veneer of optimism/affection, much unlike anything I've ever seen from her.
She's trying very hard to get back into my life. I'm hesitant, because for most of the two years they have been separated, I would let my guard down only to find some new piece of drama, whether it was a lie, an insult, hiding a relapse or manufacturing a fake emergency as a way to get more money out of me.

In the last few months, though, she's done really well. She managed to hold down a job for a few months and help my dad and brother financially. She's seemed emotionally smarter. I've started to feel guilty about keeping her shut out. It seemed like she got her shit together.

______________________________________________________________________________________________________

**Current Problem:**

She and I are friends on Facebook. However, I've just found a second FB profile for her that is much more active, public, shows *a lot* of her partying, and is under a fake name. My dad has also had various bills and insurance statements surface over the last few years with the same fake name. She, of course, denies ever providing a false name for an official purpose. My parents can't afford to get divorced but when he confronts her about this fake name, the crazy resurfaces and she threatens him with divorce. Given her history, I'm terrified she has untold numbers of bills and such under this fake name.

**Here's my question: how do you draw the line between ""not holding a grudge"" and not letting a toxic person into your life, especially when it's a parent?** I'm so lost as how to understand the difference. I can't imagine having a text-only mother for the rest of her life, but I can't handle any more volatility. I know that, deep down, somewhere is the woman who could foster moments of amazing emotional support and guidance, but for the last two years all I can do is cringe when I see a picture of her online.

Okay, so my little sister asked me for advice today on a situation I've never encountered before, and I thought I should get an objective perspective on this one. Lil sis told me that she met this guy through her best friend. Best friend told her up front that he was registered, but said that his situation was almost exactly the same as that other kid who was lied to about the girls age. Lil sis told me that he doesn't know that she knows and that they are still in the ""getting to know you"" stage. He had actually just gotten out of jail a few weeks before they met.

A little bit about my sister. First and foremost, my little sister is a very successful and beautiful girl. She got her degree and has just begun a very upwardly mobile career. She is very sweet and driven. She also has never been in a relationship. Besides the fact that she is Baptist, and is waiting until after marriage, she's always said that she wanted to focus on getting through school first. She told me that she hasn't even had her first kiss yet! (How adorable!)

This is the part that I have the most trouble with. She could very easily find a guy that is smart, successful, just as religious, and most importantly wasn't a registered sex offender (no matter the severity of the crime). I really don't think she should be wasting time with this boy. How can she start a family with him if he can't even legally be around kids? She doesn't even know how long he has to register for. He would just be a tether to her. She needs to find someone who can stay beside her and support her. He can't do that. My take on this whole thing is that her lack of experience is going to end up with her being hurt or used. Am I right to think this, or am I completely off?

**TL;DR:** My little sister might want to date a (sort of) registered sex offender, and I don't think it's a good idea.

**Edit:** I contacted the county clerk and was able to get to the details of the case. The case showed that he was telling the truth and that the girl had been lying about her age (14-16, said she was 18). But there were a few incidents (non-violent but slightly indecent) which qualified him to be registered for 25 years.

I had a talk with my sister today about everything I found and told her the suggestions you guys made as well. Unfortunately, this caused her to have a major panic attack. Luckily though, she doesn't have her heart set on this boy 100% yet. Thank you all for your help with this. I'm hoping that once she calms down a bit and has more time to think this through, that she will be able to make an informed decision.

51581,Breakups,24s3gs,"I broke up with this girl almost a month ago yet I keep thinking about the good times even though I was treated terribly in the relationship. The whole story so you all can understand goes like this. 

So I asked this girl to a school dance and she said yes. I didn't know her that well at this time but I thought she was pretty and asked anyway. We went to the dance and things go well. I tell her that I like her after a few dates after the dance, and then she starts to tell me more about herself. Before we just talked about things like family, sports, hobbies... Ect. The normal stuff when getting to know someone. We had a good amount in common with hobbies and whatnot. But now, she tells me how she's not normal, and I asked her what she meant and this is where the problems begin. 

We both play video games and enjoy them so I thought this would be something we could enjoy together when I first started the relationship. But apparently when she plays these online video games she gives her phone number out to people she's never met after barely talking to them. And then continues to talk to them for 2 years. She never calls them only chats with them. Not only does she talk to the guy but she developed feelings for him. From what he says he is, I'm very skeptical since she's never seen him in real life, he's 20. Now this is even worse.

I'm confused and she tells me that they flirt back and forth and stuff and I'm just wondering how in hell can someone even do this. It goes against all logical thinking in my opinion. So I think I can turn this crazy girl possible San by getting her to choose me since I'm here and it should be easy. And I was right. After a few weeks and more dates she said she chose me. Now i might've been wrong in asking this but I asked her to stop talking to him, and she immediately said she would stop and told me I have nothing to worry about. So I'm happy and everything goes well for a week or two

After that I found out that she lied, she didn't stop talking to the guy and says that she couldn't stop because she realized how important he is to her. At this moment I'm pissed and sad at the same time. And being lied to hurt and I'm contemplating breaking up. But I don't take action on it. Weeks go by and from what I can see she changes her mind a few times between me and him throughout this time period. I'm over worrying myself and stressing myself out on this. 

Eventually we go on a date to a theme park and when we go I decide to tell her what I feel about this whole situation and get these things off my chest. I tell her and I feel better and then we go throughout the day with everything going fine. She responds positively to everything I do. I kiss her on the cheek she kisses me back. I hug her she pulls me in closer. Then at the end of the day, she tells me we need to talk. She tells me she likes the other guy that she's never met more and that she doesn't think she will be able to decide until she meets him. I found out he lives almost an hour away and they have been planning to meet for quite a while. I'm pissed and sad like the emotional naive teenager I am. And then I go home and cry. I'm not a person to cry often and it has been almost a year since I actually cried last. She calls me to see if I'm ok. With my pride hurt I say some unsavory things. And we see where we can go from there. I decide to keep the relationship even though I was ready to end it on that phone call but something in my head told me not to so I didn't. 

She doesn't talk to me for two weeks then suddenly tells me we have to talk. After two weeks of not talking I end it saying I can't deal with this anymore. 

This was my first real relationship and I think the reason I feel like I can't get over it is because I made some mistakes and I wanted myself to be the one who never hurt her but I did on that phone call. I don't know but I think it's mainly a pride issue. That and the fact that I'm a person that thinks liking someone is much more about physical appearance and I thought she was pretty hot. Personality doesn't matter much to me but if you have a good personality I'll definitely notice and it'll help us get along better. Looking back I realize she didn't really have a personality and I was just interested in her looks. And the fact that we had stuff in common that made it easy to go on dates together and enjoy ourselves. I just need help getting over it. Please help. 

Tl;dr: my now ex gf has an online boyfriend who's 20 and cheated on me emotionally with him during our relationship.

13048,Relationships,1w6cxe,"Hey everyone, I figured I'd get some perspective from a different demographic than my own personal social circle.  Just to put the question up there, is it unfair for me to say I'm tired of hearing about my girlfriend's ex-husband?   Just for some background, she married him young and he turned out to be incredibly abusive and controlling and cheated on her several times.  There's a lot of trauma and baggage since their marriage lasted for about 6 years and she was being abused and controlled throughout that time (nothing physical, but incredibly toxic emotional abuse).  Normally it'd be reasonable to expect that ex's wouldn't be discussed in a normal relationship, but obviously we need to discuss her ex because of the lingering effects of her traumatic experiences.  

I'm her first boyfriend after their relationship ended two years ago and I've helped her through a lot of the trauma and pain from her past experiences (she's told me this explicitly).  My problem is that I'm beginning to get a little tired of her ex-husband coming up as a **casual** conversation topic.  I know that it takes time to get over six years of abuse and there's certainly things she needs to talk about with me and that I need to support her through.  Something as innocuous as playing the guitar can trigger some bad memories for her and knowing that this was the case helped me understand what I should be doing to support her.  I definitely want her to talk to me about anything like that and I've made a deliberate effort to be as supportive as I can.

The problem is that it's beginning to bother me that he comes up in the middle of random conversations  as a casual topic.  I tried to set up a romantic night for the two of us tonight by taking her out for dinner and then dessert, and in the middle of a conversation about what we think builds a strong relationship and our expectations for the future she again brought him up (saying that he didn't want a wife, he wanted a mother to take care of him).  It wasn't entirely irrelevant, but it kinda sucked the fun out of the evening for me.  There are other times that I'll be telling her how amazing she is or do something romantic like buy her flowers randomly and her first reaction will be: wow, my ex would never have said that or did that.  She doesn't do this all the time, but it comes up sporadically about once a week. 

So reddit, where do I draw the line?  Am I being unreasonable to ask her to tone down the references to her ex?  Feel free to tell me if I need to get my head out of my ass if I am.  I'd particularly like to hear from any divorcees or anyone who has been through a traumatic or abusive relationship.

I was sick at home yesterday, and we checked in with each other on chat on my iPad. Randomly, some angry men came to the door, and I was freaked out and didn't answer. I told him about it on chat, and 20 minutes later, fell asleep for about an hour.


When I woke up I saw I had about 3 missed calls, and two missed texts frantically begging me to get back to him, then angrily saying he was furious with me. I called back, and he hung up. I went on chat, and he informed me he was going offline for how angry and disappointed in me he was, and how scared he was I was hurt, and how cruel and selfish I was. This happened at 11, we chatted from 930 til 10ish.


He texted me back hours later telling me to get my bed ready, because I wasn't welcome in his. An hour later, he wanted to make sure I was in my room, with the door closed, because he didn't want to see or engage me. I did that, and he came home at 9, drank a little, and went to his bedroom. He texted me informing me that his cat (not ours, in this text suddenly) needed access to the litterbox in my room, but he would rectify the situation in the morning (I got the impression he was implying we were no longer a couple). He hasn't moved since.

We're currently 7 months in and the future looks bright and we have fantastic communication, however she feels she has been thinking about me to much recently.

A few days ago she felt she desired moving forward faster into things like sex, but because of her religious beliefs, as she comes from a very religious family and is also deeply religious, we made it very clear at the beginning of our relationship we'd like to stay abstinent as well as I believe I am uncomfortable having sex unless I am comfortable bring another person into this world. We're currently just reaching a stage of foundling well clothed. The problem she is having trouble forming coherent thoughts and such as she is thinking about me and us to much.

She also was worried by her mother on the same day this desire started because her mother felt some parts of our relationship weren't healthy and made her mother and father uncomfortable. By this her mother mean't the amount of contact we liked to have, sitting together (usually hip to hip) or holding hands whenever we could. We have chatted about this and she feels much better about it and I am okay with us calming down on DPA so it isn't a huge problem but i'd still like your opinions. Her mother also believes she should have a relationship mentor to help her with her thoughts, feelings, and emotions. We pretty much talk about all of that and are very open though. Although her parents don't know how open we are with each other. Do you think her mother may just be causing her more worry then necessary?

Lastly her father had also invited me on a camping trip with them this weekend. (I'm fairly confident her parents do like me) She had asked me if I minded letting her be alone with her thoughts and to try and figure out her thoughts so she can't un-scramble her thought-process and for her to pray for guidance in what to do.

Pretty much I asked my boyfriend to go on a break, I figured that we're young and I wanted to have a college experience that didn't feel like a married relationship. Additionally I was in a sorority and he was in the dorms so it was just making socializing and hanging out a little awkward as he often wasn't invited to mixers and parties. 


I wanted to be able to go to these mixers and parties and have fun without feeling guilty about my boyfriend being a loser alone by himself in his dorm room. We had been fighting a bit about me going on ""dates"" with other guys to my sororities socials/end of year parties instead of taking him. So I suggested a break it would give us each time to develop as individuals and have fun without being worried about the other person.


Eventually we would come back together after a year or so to figure out who we were. However he immediately started hooking up with girls/going to parties which was just disrespectful. I was being immature so I decided to copy his actions and see how he felt, I just ended up feeling disgusted and violated by my hookups and they weren't nearly as good as him. The worst part is he congratulated me when I told him, HE DIDN'T EVEN CARE THAT HIS POTENTIAL FUTURE WIFE WAS SLEEPING AROUND.


Anyways after a few months I realized that this whole break thing was a bad idea, but when I bring up getting back together he keeps telling me that he ""hasn't fully found himself yet"" and tells me to check back in a couple weeks. 

I know he's just standing me up at this point, and it hurts because he is the love of my life and I can't seem to explain to him how sorry I am for this whole break mess. I feel like I threw away the best thing in my life because I wanted to have fun.

So I've been trying to hangout with her, and she's probably thinking that I like her. She is aware that I want to ask her to prom because her friend found out but she might think I am into her (I mean I am, but that's not what I'm going for. It probably wouldn't work out because I'd be going to University soon)

So anyhow, I messaged her on facebook around 8:00PM asking if she wanted to walk to the nearby cafe for lunch the next day. She replied
""i have to be honest im not interested in the dating scene or anything!""
and I'm not totally sure what that means. She's had boyfriends before. So does she mean she's not into guys that are interested in her, etc? I'm trying to figure out what she means. And this is all she sent. She's usually the sweetest person ever so I'm really confused.

I replied but she hasn't seen my message (almost been 24h) and I'm getting worried. I don't know exactly what her message means so I can't confront her, but she hasn't seen my reply (which was basically me explaining I was trying to get to know her better)

Any ideas on what the message means or what I should do next? At school when I saw her she was staring at me, that's all I really know.

I want to be the dominant one in the relationship but sometimes I feel like I'm wayyy too attached to her (and I don't want to seem clingy/needy). We've had conversations where she claims she thinks she's WAY more into me than I am into her, which I don't blame her for thinking because I'm pretty good at acting like I'm not attached but I really am. Then I start thinking about the fact that maybe things will go bad because I'm holding back on showing all of my interest in her and I definitely don't want her to think something's wrong because of this.

164553,Breakups,23p4jv,"**TL;DR;** : Me [24 M] broke up with my GF [23 F] today after 7 years.. LF friends/advice/suggestions :( :(


Well starting with our relationship 7 years back.. it was a casual fling but slowly with time we started to have feelings for each other.. Also i should have mentioned this earlier.. I am from India, many parents here arrange marriage without thinking what their child wants.. luckily my parents are not one of them.. they had a love marriage too.. Talking about the girl, i met her in college we started to date, thinking everything will go well. First strike was when her parents started to look for a guy. I asked her if she can go against her parents, she bluntly said 'No'. I knew a day would come for which i'll have to be prepared, unfortunately i wasn't. Even after all this, we were still dating, I was hoping something will change and she or her parents will change her mind. I don't know for some reason she still wants to keep in touch with me but as friends, which is more than difficult for me to see her with someone else.

Today she is still single, will be getting married soon with a guy her parents will choose and not her. Also i try to console myself thinking, a girl who cannot love me enough to go against her parents was not love. I don't know, i might be wrong. But right now I feel like i am stranded, no where to go.

We haven't even dated or anything.  I've just had a huge crush on this girl, Mary, since about the middle of Freshman Year, it's Junior Year now about 2 years later and I still like her more than ever.

During all of Freshman Year I didn't talk to her very much, she was only in one of my classes and we never sat next to each other or worked together so it was kinda hard and I'm a little bit introverted so I had a hard time approaching her with nothing.

Sophomore Year after our homecoming dance, a month or so into the year, Mary and a few of her friends are invited over to my friend Bob's house for a few hours to chill, Anthony, Matthew, and I are also, we are about the same age and us guys are all really good friends.  Nothing really happens, we all just talk about stuff.  I'm starting to like Mary even more 'cause her personality is awesome along with looks.  She and her friends kinda ""join"" our clique (for lack of a better word) and we start to text, we all kinda asked for their numbers before they left.  Later that night after they left we talk about them and we realize we all like her... fuck... so we make an agreement not to go for her and try to date her so that we wouldn't fight each other.

A few months later, I'm really close friends with Mary, and she tells me that she likes Anthony and that she doesn't really know what she should do and she wants some advice because I am probably Anthony's best friend at the time.  I give in, figuring that if she actually told me there probably isn't much of a chance of dating her and that I'm probably too deep in the friendzone to do anything anyway.  I talk to Anthony, find out Anthony wouldn't be opposed to going out with her.  Tell Mary that and urge her to make a move.  She does and they go out.

They break up about 6 months later right before the end of Sophomore Year.  I end up being a third wheel a bit in the beginning because I was good friends with them both.  My friendship with Anthony really deteriorated during their relationship, however, until probably a month before they broke up when we talked about everything and settled our disagreements, mostly about her, I didn't think he treated her very well.  He would ignore her a lot and it would really get to her and because I liked her I would automatically view Anthony as the bad guy... I'm not perfect.

Now during the summer Mary and I talk a lot, and when we weren't in the same city, we texted almost all day.  She was really the only person I texted while I was on vacation and according to all my friends (which are also her friends) she didn't text anyone other than me.  I think about asking her out maybe, she's even told me that she has gotten over Anthony but I hold back fearing rejection and I regret doing so.  Anthony and I also became like best friends again.

School starts up, I moved schools, we still keep in touch but out conversations over text and Skype aren't as meaningful and she stopped texting first.  We still hang out on the weekends with everyone else but I stop getting a good vibe from her.  Eventually she tells me she still likes Anthony.  I don't know why she told me, there had to have been better people to tell.  I get frustrated but try to hold it in and just tell her that she should move on and that he isn't worth wasting time trying to get as nothing will come of it.  This escaladed into a fight, which ended in me telling her I liked her a week later... sigh...

We didn't talk at all for about two months after that.  Absolutely no communication and I stopped hanging out with her on the weekends.  I would usually host stuff just because I'm the most proactive of everyone about planning shit so when I stopped inviting her she stopped hanging out with us... I feel bad about it thinking back as she didn't hang out with anyone else during that time :( .  About a month and a half ago, at the end of December, we started hanging out spontaneously (Anthony, Matthew, and I were driving around kinda late at night and we decided to stop by her house cause why the hell not?  We then pick up one of her friends and went to IHOP)  We've been hanging out more since then, all of us.

We went to a party together, basically all of us who were at Bob's house more than a year earlier.  Bob is flirting with Mary big time, Mary is liking it, Bob knows I really like Mary.  I'm uncomfortable and kinda miserable, Matthey and Anthony see that I'm miserable as well and we leave and go to another party... Mary is sad that we left and would've rather gone with us than stay with Bob according to her.

Anyway we go to this party, I get drunk and decide tonight would be a wonderful time to text Mary telling her how much I am in love with her (Go me! :/ ).  She says she isn't interested in being in a relationship with me.  I apologize later that week, she says its okay and accepts my apology apparently them flirting wasn't even genuine and just a joke played by Bob... I don't really know what to think about that though.  A few days later we all get together and have a superbowl part, we both flirt with each other the whole time, it was really fun.  I drive her back home and we talk about an hour in the car right outside of her house.  

I kinda make a decision here that I'm not sure was the best.  I told her that we probably shouldn't talk too much because I am trying to get over her and be able to date other girls.  She was extremely upset and I felt pretty bad about it but... I dunno... I feel like talking to her a lot isn't really helping me move on...

So last weekend we all hung out again, saw a movie, came back to my house were I flirted a with her and we talked to each other more than anyone else there.  I actually didn't realize it until after I drove her home (we talked some more of course) and came back when my Mathew and Anthony pointed it out.  While in the car though I brought up being in a relationship and I had a bit of trouble deciphering what she said.  Something about her not really knowing what she want's and that she tries not to want to be in a relationship because I didn't really understand her reasoning but yea.  And I haven't talked to her at all this week  .I;ve been texting Anthony a lot about it and he let out that he kinda has feeling for her as well but would help me get with her.  I sent her an IM over Skype a few hours ago while she was online and I got no reply...  She is going to a concert tomorrow with everyone except me (I'm busy) and I am really jealous that they, especially Anthony, will be hanging out with her without me.  I don't want to be jealous, why am I jealous?

So here I am sad because tomorrow I am going to be alone on Valentine's Day _again_ and I don't know what I should do about Mary.  I feel like going out with her is possible, then I feel like its never ganna happen.  Meanwhile I don't know how to get over it.  I guess I would just stop talking to her but that means she wouldn't hang out with anyone really right now as it would basically cut her out.  I feel like doing that would be really mean... ahhh fuck... What should I do???

I have been staring at the submission screen for about 15minutes wondering whether or not I should just x out and go to bed.  This post seems too long and maybe it doesn't even belong here, its probably full of grammatical and spelling mistakes too... ehh... I'll submit right after I finish typing this sentence no second thoughts.

60666,Non-Romantic,2p2xrr,"So I've been regularly hanging out with my boyfriend and his friends for over two years, we’ve become a solid group and everything is great.


In the last six months Chelsea was introduced to our group, and she’s okay- not really interesting or funny (which is important to me I guess) and a big flirt with all the guys, which I found kind of lame, considering they all have girlfriends. But that's not what this is about. 


Anyways I found her okay, but my friends liked her, and in any case it was cool to have another female in the group, so we invited her to hangouts.


About a month and a half ago she was at my place with my boyfriend and my other friend, Matthew, and we were all sitting around and talking. I started telling a new story (or something, I don't really remember) when Chelsea hides her face behind a pillow and says to my boyfriend and Matthew, She's doing it again.


I stopped talking and we all sort of looked at her. My boyfriend kind of laughs and says, She's doing what?


Being the center of attention.


I'm a pretty sensitive person and this comment really shocked me, especially since she made me realize that it was kind of true- I DID just sit down in front of the TV where everyone was facing (kind of an attention-seeking move in hindsight, but it was completely subconscious on my part).


In my defense we were playing a video game previously and at that point it was on pause and nobody was touching the controllers, so it was obvious (to me) that the TV wasn't being used anyway... but anyways, she had a point, and it stung.


It really bothered me, though, because in my opinion there were SO many cooler ways that she could have said that- like a) to ME and not just my friends b) in private or c) at least in a nice way, like, “Look, I find you’re often trying to be the center of attention, and…” I just feel like she was pretty harsh, especially since she didn’t know me that well at all.


After that I (somewhat cattily) decide that I don’t really like her after that and so I stop inviting her to hangouts (it’s always me and my boyfriend organizing these things, and at our place, so it’s easy to just not invite her).


About a month after the incident I hadn’t seen her in some time and while cleaning up my Facebook friends (something I do regularly, I like having maybe 80 Facebook friends) I defriended her as well as a bunch of random ex-coworkers, people-I-met-once-at-a-party and so on. I figured I wouldn’t see her again.


So, now in the present: I’m having a party next Friday and mine and Chelsea’s main mutual friend asked if he can invite her to the (Facebook) event. I explain what happened to him (including my defriending of her) and honestly so much time has passed that I would rather just forgive her and hang out with her again. But he understands the awkwardness, and doesn’t invite her.  And now I just realized that my OTHER friend, Matthew, invited her, and as a result she’s coming to my place Friday.


Trying to make the best of the situation (and honestly I’m kind of happy she’s coming because otherwise it would be a total sausagefest, sorry if it’s lame to “use” her like that) I re-friended her on Facebook.


So finally, my question:


Do I mention the defriending when I see her, pretending it was an accident or something? Should I talk to her about what she said way back when? Or should I just pretend like nothing happened?


I know this is a really boring problem but I don’t want things to be awkward and I very seriously obsess over this kind of thing.


Thanks for your help!

Rance: Hates conflict, Dating the cheating girlfriend Laura, Lost virginity to laura, Tony &amp; I's friend since freshman year

Ricardo: Rance's best friend of 5 years, both from the same small town. Freshman

Beaux: Tony's friend since high school or so, and current roomate. Good friends with Rance and I as well


Story time:
Rance, Tony, Beaux &amp; I are best friends who are very close, and we met the first week of our freshman year. I introduced Laura to Rance after we met at a social event during our schools welcome week. Rance and Laura hit it off after a while and end up dating just before the end of the first semester. Laura was a stereotypical catholic girl, and Rance is a stereotypical shy boy/geek who hates any form of conflict (but we love him for it). Their relationship is great for the rest of the year. Then come beginning of our Sophomore year (Fall 2014) Rance's best friend from back home starts attending this university as well. They both come from a small town, and have been best friends for ~5 years. This is when i started noticing things getting weird.

Rance and Laura lost their virginity's to each other about halfway through our current semester. They had always had a great relationship and never seemed to have any issues. We live in a 4 bed 2 bath apartment, Tony, Rance, Beaux and I own the rooms, while Laura stays with Rance in his room, and Ricardo sleeps on the couch in our living room. Laura and Ricardo both have traditional style dorm rooms on campus. Ricardo and Laura start to become good friends, and nothing was really out of place. Until i started noticing a few things.

Laura and Ricardo would often go into Rance's room (while we were all home) and we wouldn't here from them for a while. Most of us didnt think much of it, as we just assumed that they were talking or something, as Laura SEEMED to be a trustworthy person, so there was no reason to think otherwise. But eventually they start to spend more time alone together than Rance spent with her. Laura and Ricardo would go into Rance's room and he would read her homework with her, while Rance would be playing pokemon in the living room. Eventually things start to smell fishy to me as i feel its weird how much time they are spending together. One time i needed to get into rance's room to borrow a charger, and when i went to open the door it was locked. I knocked and i heard ricardo and laura talking. It took about 20 seconds or so for them to unlock the door. That was one of the first signs i should have noticed that things were getting out of hand. But at the time i thought nothing of it, as its not my relationship, and if rance is ok with them spending so much time with them, then so be it.

Eventually I start to think something is up, but i keep it to myself as i dont want to start pointing fingers at nothing. But today Tony told me he needed to talk to me. Ricardo had told Tony that Laura had told him (Ricardo) that she was in love with him, and that she thinks of him when she has sex with Rance. Eventually me and tony sneak off and we discuss everything we know. I find out that while we were all watching movies in the living room 2 weeks ago, Laura convinced ricardo to finger her as she was sitting next to Rance on our 3 man couch. She was literally in between Rance and Ricardo and she was letting Ricardo finger bang her while Rance sat ~2 inches away, and he had no idea it was happening. Ricardo claims that he was talked into doing it, and that it wasnt his fault, and that he never reciprocated Laura's feeling, although after his finger banged her, its safe to say thats a lie. According to Ricardo, that is the only physical thing they have done to each other, but ill keep y'all updated if i find out more. Anyway, Laura ended up telling Rance that it happend the next day, and he Forgave her AND Ricardo. Rance told her that she needed to cut all contact with Ricardo, but then Laura said that if she forces her to never speak to ricardo again, she will break up with him. So Rance just drops it and says never mind. Rance is the sweetest guy you will ever meet, but bless his soul, he is a pushover. He knows that his girlfriend is in love with Ricardo, and that she wont stop talking to him, and he still wont break up with her.

The issue im running into is that Rance &amp; Laura have no idea that me and Tony know everything. Ricardo talked to tony last week and some today and told him what happened, but he wasnt supposed to tell anyone else. Rance and Ricardo usually will go to Tony for help/emotional support. But what they dont know is that i'm the one tony goes to for emotional support as well. So tony tells me everything that he wasnt supposed to share although i feel it was perfectly acceptable of him to tell me. But because of this, i dont think its appropriate for Tony and I to straight up come out and confront Rance, Ricardo, and Laura about the situation. As neither me or tony should technically know about this. Rance is too in love with Laura to leave her, and i feel that Laura knows this and is using it to her advantage. Ricardo will not be returning next semester (mostly because rance doesnt want him around anymore). But Laura has told Ricardo that if he returns home, she will go and visit him.

This is just a cluster fuck, Tony &amp; I are not sure what to do next. Do we confront Laura, Rance, and Ricardo together? Or do we pull rance away and explain to him everything? But as of right now, those 3 are acting like nothing ever happened, and they have no idea that Tony, Beaux, and I know everything. Tony, Beaux, and I are livid and don't know where to go from here, but we aren't just going to sit back and do nothing. I appreciate all of the input y'all give me.

**tl;dr;** Rance's Girlfriend is cheating on him with Ricardo, who is his best friend from back home. Rance knows about it, but is too scared to do anything about it. Read the small biography to learn about each of us.

**Update:** We have come to a decision. Tony, Beaux, and I are going to wait until Rance, Laura, and Ricardo are in the living room together. Then we are going to basically play the Bad guy and kick both Ricardo, and Laura out of the room. It will be up to rance to break up with her, or not. But she will no longer be allowed in our room, and neither will ricardo. Its unforunate that it has come to this, as i was becoming good friends with ricardo, as he SEEMED like a stand up guy. But obviously given the circumstances one can see that he has no loyalties to anyone but himself.

In the week of NC, I had done a lot of self reflection and made a few changes of things she mentioned to better myself (not particularly for her). We both agreed we wanted each other in our lives and continued to talk and meet up occasionally. 

These talks were basically just releasing anything that was unsaid. We had some communication problems and she was not comfortable telling me everything during the relationship or the breakup, but after seeing how understanding and open to listen I was, she decided she could. We kept meeting up and it seemed like we were getting back into things and we were both happy and everything was perfect. She started showing her feelings for me again and was so happy to have me. All of a sudden, two days ago she decided she wanted to break everything off. She said she couldn't do it because she was still in love with me and couldn't handle it, and she just wanted space.

We are going to talk tomorrow and I am pushing for it to be in person because I like having serious discussions in person and not behind a screen. She really doesn't want to meet in person because she doesn't think she can control herself with me and doesn't want things to get physical (sexual). I don't want to force her into seeing me in person, but I think serious conversations in general should be in person.

134432,Non-Romantic,1vt4zu,"So, this whole situation deserves a bit of a backstory. I first met S when he and my roommate at the time, A, became friends via craigslist about 2 years ago. I hung around him a few times, and he seemed nice enough, just a little on the slow side, which wasn’t really a big deal. He then started to hang around my house and my friends quite frequently, and it became quite evident that this guy is…well, a nice, good hearted person, but just…painfully dumb. 


Once he became more comfortable with us, he began dominating conversations while barely being able to get a coherent point across, he is extremely argumentative about certain issues, and has clearly done no actual research on the subjects. I feel like a bad person for saying it, but he dumbs down every conversation I’ve seen him have, and it is incredibly frustrating for both my friends and I to be around. I’m generally an extremely tolerant person, and I’ve really, really tried to like him. I’ve known him for two years, and as much as I try, the distain just grows the more I try to be nice and get to know him. 

About a year ago, A and I parted ways as roommates, and the stars aligned just so that S needed a room for rent, and A needed one more roommate at the place where she was moving. S and A moved in together, and A quickly realized that she had made a terrible mistake. All of their other roommates (who are also friends of A and myself) have grown to absolutely detest being around him for a multitude of reasons. The weekly board game night that A hosts at their house is one of the bigger points of contention. We are all pretty nerdy, generally very intelligent and educated, and most importantly, very capable of quickly learning how to play complex board games. He is not. 

Another annoyance about game night, is that everyone who comes always brings some sort of (quality, expensive) booze, smokeables and food. S takes advantage of the bounty but never brings anything to share. He is completely oblivious to the fact she’s expected to contribute as he mows down on the smoked salmon and fancy cheese with a chaser of whiskey that someone dropped $80 on. Everyone in our friend group is extremely frustrated with him. I feel bad about this, and the fact that I have participated in it, but it’s gotten to the point where people are making jokes at his expense right in front of him, and they completely go over his head. 

A couple of weeks ago, one of our mutual friends, L, made a post of Facebook about making a trip to this awesome restaurant just outside of town, and tagged everyone else in our friend group to see if we wanted to make the trip with her. S saw the post, and commented something like, “I see I’m not invited to (insert restaurant name) again.” At that point, L felt like she owed him an explanation and another one of A’s roommates, C, was about to reach a breaking point with him, so L agreed to step in and speak for all of us, and tell him that we just don’t want to hang out with him anymore, and why. According to L, that conversation went just about as well as anyone would expect, but he seemed to get the point. 

So, fast forward to game night, last Friday. I show up, and there’s everyone at the table, as usual…and there’s S. The week between this one, and the conversation S had with L, he was home, but kept to himself and didn’t join, so we thought the worst was over…but apparently not. Everyone’s kind of looking at each other, non-verbally wondering why the fuck he is sitting with us. We wanted to play Catan, but since he was there and expressed that he doesn’t know how to play that, we started to play “Loaded Questions,” which is a game where someone reads a question, everyone writes down an answer, and then whomever’s turn it is has to guess who wrote which answer. Because of S not paying attention and not fully understanding the rules, the normally short game took about 2 hours, in which time everyone was getting increasingly drunk (long gaps between turns = people getting drunk quickly), and increasingly annoyed with S. 

The more the more the game wore on, the more jokes at his expense were being tossed around, in and outside of the actual game play, nearly all of which completely went over his head. As the game was about to end, I wrote a joking answer that was about him, and he finally caught on that it might be about him. He tried to call me out, my friends tried to smooth it over to avoid the confrontation, and he ended up just storming off. 

On the one hand…I have my doubts that he’s going to show up to game night again, but I feel like I owe him an apology. It’s just difficult, because I know that if I initiate a conversation with him, no matter how I choose to apologize, I have to tell him that despite me feeling bad about what I did, that we just don’t want to hang out with him anymore, and that’s why I did what I did. So, I’m feeling pretty torn about initiating that apology, since it is going to come off as back handed no matter how I say it. I can’t apologize and tell him that I want him to continue to hang out with us, or not say anything about why I did what I did. 

I know this makes my friends and I sound like terrible, judgmental people, but really that’s not the case. They are all wonderfully nice, and accepting people. They are truly my best friends and the fact that this one person is putting a huge hindrance my enjoyment of their company just sucks. We’ve all tried to give him a chance, and we had to find some way to actually enjoy game night. The fact that we resorted to humor at someone else’s expense was not nice, and heavily fueled by alcohol and a long past of frustration. 


 Thoughts? What would you do? 


TL;DR
A roommate of my close friend is constantly encroaching on our hang outs, and is really unintelligent and doesn't contribute anything, when other people are spending a lot of money on booze and food to share. I pissed him off during a game by making a joke at his expense because I thought he wouldn't catch on, but he did. I feel like I should apologize, but there's no way for me to do it without it being a totally backhanded apology. Halp.

21942,Relationships,333l0p,"My girlfriend is considering leaving me for reasons I can’t wrap my head around. I’m just looking for some advice/opinions/perspective. Thanks for any help in advance.


First some background: me and my girlfriend (Sarah) have been together for 3 years. For the majority of that time we’ve been incredibly in love. We always have a great time together, have been very happy and can talk to each other about anything. We consider each other best friends. It is also both of our first proper relationships. Sarah has a history of depression, which seems to be on and off and I’ve been helping her get through it. She had is since before we met.


A few months into the relationship, after saying “I love you” etc, she started having doubts. Her mother was worried she was “settling too early” and that maybe she should try other people before getting serious. But we were (and still are) madly in love so we worked past that and she pushed that thought to the back of her mind (her parents are divorced so that may influence her thinking).


The first year of our relationship we lived a couple of hours away, so only saw each other once a week and sometimes once a fortnight, then the next two years we lived in the same city so we saw each other more. This year however, I had to move state for graduate school. So far we’ve only seen each other once since I left (8 weeks between leaving and seeing her). I last saw her a week ago.


A week after I first left, she met someone named Jack. Sarah and Jack have heaps in common, but he’s a bit of an asshole. He takes hours to reply, is an elitist and snobby, cancels seeing her etc. He also wants to date Sarah, constantly sending messages confessing his attraction to her, plans for a future together etc. Every day I get calls or messages from Sarah complaining about Jack not replying or just being an asshole.


A week ago when we were together, she would guard her phone, message Jack while we were spending time together, and not let me see what they are talking about. Which really bugged me because we hadn’t seen each other and she was constantly focused on Jack, and I don’t really like her talking to him in general because of the things he says to her. And sometimes she flirts back, but not on purpose, I believe it’s just because she’s naïve and thinks they are joking around. By the way, she’s not cheating on me, I’m certain of this.


Now the last couple of days she’s been talking about our relationship, and how she’s stressed that it’s not working properly. Her main concerns were: not wanting to move to where I am because she wants to do further study, me being too controlling when we are together (i.e dictating what we eat, watch on TV etc), and not being social enough (I never went to many social gatherings with her friends and stuff, partly because I’m shy and introverted and partly because I was studying so hard to get into grad school). We talked about this and I told her I’d try hard to fix those problems, and that she didn’t have to move, and it all seemed ok. 


Now today: she’s gone back to her way of thinking from years ago (settling too early, want to try other people). I think this might be brought on by Jack. The part I don’t understand, is we are still madly in love. She just thinks that it’d make her a better, more rounded person if she could play the field a bit. The fact that she is considering breaking up with someone she loves for this reason doesn’t make sense to me. 


I’ll include some of what she said about it, so you can get it from her perspective. All messages are from her unless it says ‘me’ before it:


&gt; Baby, maybe we should do couples councelling. I’m sorry

&gt; Im really worried that i need to get dating out of my system. Maybe theres a way to do it besides dating. And maybe it can show me how lucky i am again. Put things into perspective for both of us.

&gt; I know part of why our relationship is special is that we found eachother before anyone else had us, but sometimes i wonder if it wouldnt have been better we didnt. That we found eachother later. I have nothing to go off. But i love you. I wish i had more perspective

&gt; Me: Have you ever met a guy and thought id rather be with him than [me]?

&gt; her: No. But maybe thats part of the issue with jack. I never dated apart from you, and he seems to want to and its sort of fascinating, like an unusual picture or something. 

&gt; Me: How does he not turn you off dating?

&gt; her: Things in common bit i guess. And that hes still somewhat a mystery because people can be different on fb that face to face

&gt; I know. Its all gone through my head a million times. But i dont want to be married and unhappy because of regrets or resentment and i dont want to feel this way because it isnt fair on you even if i dont act on it. So its another reason this relationship is stressed. Whats the right thing to do?

&gt; im not sure how much has to do with my parents divorce. also i guess i wonder if itll help me learn more about me and understand other people. i feel really clueless and naïve. i love you and i know youre wonderful and we're good. but i feel like its a massive learning opportunity. and sometimes i get scared when im not that happy that the fact you were there in a tough year makes you my best friend, yeah, but am i happy enough for boyfriend? and im not sure how to explain. i love you. but the times where i get frustrated and stuff i worry that im being unfair to us both. i dont ever want you out of my life and i do love you. but i dont want to ruin things and maybe if i knew more about myself and people and relatonships id be clearer on whats fair for us. i feel i dont know enough to be fully informed and confident in things and yeah, my parents' divorce is a factor there


To be clear, if she left me to try dating other people, and decided she wanted me back, I would NOT take her back.

Thanks for anyone that managed to read this far. I know it’s a huge wall of text but I don’t know where else to go or who to talk to. And I don’t know what to say to Sarah. I guess I want to convince her that she doesn't need to feel this way. I was hoping to spend the rest of my life with her.

A year ago I was leaving the house to go get a haircut and he stopped me and said i should try growing it out ""for a change""   I've tried many times throughout my life to grow it out and have always gotten frustrated with the inbetween stages and not feeling or looking like myself. The one time i did manage to grow it out to shoulder length my kind of thin hair was all flippy and silly looking. 


So when he asked me to grow it out the first time I said not this time, maybe next. And I've basically been saying that to him every two months when I go in for a cut. 


He has started to practically beg me to grow it out even when I explain to him how weird it is to me and that i don't feel comfortable or like myself with longer hair. When I asked why he wanted me to grow out he just repeated that he wants me try something new. 


Then he took it a little to far for me and bought me wigs to wear without consulting me first. I had no interest in whigs before but would have been open to trying some if he had talked to me first. 


I am really starting to feel like he is not attracted to me with my current short hair... I have an ass and boobs and an hourglass figure and I've never been mistaken as a man or anything...

Anyway, there's this group of lawyers (I think all of them are lawyers) who come to the bar at around the same time as us. These guys are, I suppose in their late 20s, by my estimation. They're rich as fuck regularly giving everybody drinks on their tabs. They're a group of 5 and most of them are arrogant fucks who just come and just show off.

However there's the one amongst them. He's really handsome and I've never been more attracted to a man before. What I noticed is that of all of these guys, he's the only one who's not an arrogant fuck. He doesn't show off like the others, he's extremely polite, and always apologises to the staff on behalf of his friends and leaves them a tip. He also tell his friends to shut up if they're being too rowdy. Also, I've seen him help a really drunk girl back to her friends and stopped a sleazy guy from taking her back to her place.

He'd sometimes bring a hot girl with him but for the past few weeks he's been coming only with the guys. We've never made contact before other than a Hello here and there while ordering drinks but recently I've seen him flash a smile or two in my direction. I usually just blush awkwardly and turn away.

I need your help Reddit. I feel so intimidated by him, but I really really like him too. He's handsome, has a good job and biggest of all isn't a conceited fuck because of that.

155640,Relationships,2yescm,"I'm using a throwaway because I know my boyfriend has used reddit before. We've been in a relationship for one year &amp; nine months, before we started dating he had quite a few friends who were girls, about half of his friends were. I didn't want to isolate him from half of the population, I let him maintain a lot of friendships with other girls but there was one in particular who I didn't like. They were very close friends, they had sleepovers, cuddled while watching movies, and stuff like that. He insists that they have never kissed or done anything sexual, I 99% believe him but I've always just felt their friendship was too close for comfort. I told him I'd let him hang out with her but as long as other people are around (not alone) and it's during the day. And he was okay with that.

He stuck to his promise until once just over a year into our relationship, one day when he was hanging out with her and someone else, the other person left. He was with her for over 2 hours after that, and he didn't even tell me at first. I saw the other girl tweet his female friend saying sorry I had to leave early, and I confronted my boyfriend about it, he did tell the truth that they were alone but he said it was only for about half an hour, and a couple weeks after that when we were talking he said 2 hours, so I caught him in a bit of a lie. I was glad he told the truth about being alone with her, but I felt like he was trying to make it seem less bad than it was by lying about the duration. When he lied I lost a bit of trust for him, and I was very hurt. After that I gave him the choice of me or her, I said he's going no contact with her or else I'm breaking up with him, and he chose me. So he promised to stop talking to her. 

Now fast forward to yesterday, I was using his phone for something, and I saw some texts from her. She texted him first and it was asking about how his dad was (he got in a car accident). He told her the story and stuff, and they started just talking about eachother/life/etc and there were probably about 25 texts sent each way. She said he had to go do something, and he didn't reply to her since, and those texts were from two days before. After I saw this I asked him if he had still been no contact with her, he said yes, and that made me soo angry that he lied. I grabbed his hair and showed him the texts I saw, and he started saying sorry and tried to justify it and I just left. Please don't say stuff about grabbing his hair, I acknowledge that was wrong, and I plan on apologizing to him for it. I did not smack him or anything else and that is the only time I've ever used any sort of physical force towards him, and I was really distressed. 

How do you think I could best handle this situation now? I want to apologize if I over reacted, but I want him to apologize as well for lying and for talking to her. Is it reasonable for me to ask that he blocks her number? I don't want to seem overly jealous but he made the agreement that he can't talk to her, and he broke it. But I still do love him a lot and I want to give him another chance.

Our relationship has been growing, but very slowly, through-out these 2 years. It is clear we are both interested and very attracted to each other. He is just a commitment-phoebe. 


We started out as strangers who would see each other at the local pub every weekend. Eventually we exchanged numbers and went on a coffee date and got to know each other more. After our coffee date, I learned that he is a guy who is always on the go. He has seen the world, he is a traveler and always keeps himself busy, plus he works long works at night. I could tell he was not a relationship-guy. I knew that if anything were to happen between us, it was to grow and happen very slowly. I was right. 2 years later and things are still growing organically on their own.


After our date, I would continue seeing him at the local pub every single weekend. We became friends now. We would chat every weekend at the pub and eventually I met all of this friends. I started hanging out with him and his buddies after the pub at his place. 


A few months after our date, we were hanging out alone at his place and he began making out with me. He wanted to take things further, but I freaked out (was a virgin, he didn't know) and stopped him. He was seemed totally cool with it. We ended up cuddling the rest of the night and falling asleep in each others arms. Nothing was awkward or had changed after that. We continued learning new things about each other.


One year later (3 months ago) - We grab some food after the pub, chat the whole car-ride. Get to his place and he starts making out with me again. This time, I couldn't stop him or myself. It was too good. He was about to stick it in me, but I freaked out again and told him I couldn't. He looked confused, and asked me why. I told him I was a virgin and there was silence. I could tell he was very surprised. He asked me if there was a reason why I hadn't done it yet. (I think he was trying to figure out with I was holding onto it for marriage, or for religious reason). I simply told him, I hadn't found anyone that I had been comfortable enough to do it with yet. There was silence again, and then he said, ""that's really respectful of yourself. If you want, we can try tonight."" and we did. He went super slow and was really patient and great the whole time. He told me I was beautiful, pretty and awesome. (Things he had never said to me before, were all coming out) After the night of losing my virginity to him, he texted me immediately the next morning asking me if I was ok and if I had fun, he was really concerned and caring. 


3 months later, (today) - 2 years of knowing each other now. I hang out at his place regularly, we chat and we have sex often. We have never been so comfortable with each other. I believe it is clear he has feelings for me and I think I do too, I just hate to admit it. Last night, he asked me if I'm sleeping with anyone else. I said ""nope, just you. You?"" He said, ""No, just you"". He told me himself that is a ""unpredictable"" and ""inconsistent"" guy. I don't care, predictable and consistent is boring to me. Our work schedules are pretty opposite, so it makes hanging out difficult. He works nights, I work days, which is another reason why I can see him not wanting to commit.


Our relationship has gotten far these past 2 years. Naturally and organically things have been growing between us. And I feel like all that is left is for us to commit and become exclusive.

131623,Relationships,1q9jat,"Hello! My GF and I have been dating for almost a year now but recently I've been thinking about breaking up.
 

**Background on our Relationship**: We have known each other since sophomore year and I've always thought shes been very attractive, smart and funny. After high school we both had broken up with our SO's. She had been single for over a year and a half and I had just gotten out of a bad relationship. After my breakup, she and I started hanging out very regularly spending almost every day with each other. After a few months of hanging out and going to parties we both got really drunk and had sex. A few days after, I asked her to be my girlfriend and she said yes. She moved in with my mother and me about 4 months into our relationship because of her poor relationship with her family and because her school was much closer to my house than it was to her families. We both were happy and she needed to save money on gas so this seemed like a great idea. 


**Fast forward to today...**

After her parents spent $14k on her dental school and after she spent 7 months going to school full time during the summer she decided that dental work is not something that she wants to do. Even though she was only 2 weeks away from having a full time job that pays 15$/hr with benefits, she still thought that having a retail job would be better. This is a huge problem to me because in the beginning we were both lazy, under-achievers but around August I had a revelation of sorts where I gained a huge sense of drive, confidence and the need to be challenged. Most would see this as a good thing for our relationship because now I can inspire her to do the same. She however, refuses to do anything if it is hard or requires any amount of effort on her part and if she does end up doing something, shes always complaining about everything.

Recently this has been causing doubt to creep into my thoughts. I don't know if I want to be with this kind of person for very much longer as I want my SO to be as passionate about life as I am and right now, I'm feeling suffocated or tied-down more than anything else. I feel trapped in this relationship because things have been going relatively well recently and I don't think she has any inkling that I've been contemplating a break up.

All the people that I've spoken to this about say that I need to tell her how I feel because people can change and I need to give her a chance rather than just break up with her. However, I've known her for 5 years and she hasn't changed at all since then. She's still just as lazy and unambitious as ever and I can't ever see her becoming the person I want to be with.

There's a female that I've been sort of having a thing with for about a month now. About twice a weekend for the past two weeks we've been hanging out and stuff; we've kissed twice (that's it).

Recently I discovered through a mutual friend that she told him she didn't think anything would happen between us because she's interested in multiple people and we aren't really anything other than friends right now.
I addressed this with her soon after and she told me that she is into me and we're still in the beginning stages of seeing where this goes. She also said that the reason she said that we're just friends is because people had been saying we were dating and she doesn't see it that way.

**So, I need a second opinion from all of you... My issues with this are:**

1) She says to a third party that she doesn't see it going anywhere and then goes on to tell me she likes me.

2) She essentially said we were friends right now, yet she's previously said she finds me physically attractive and she's let me kiss her.

3) She also said there are other people she's interested in (to mutual friend).

4) I feel like I'm a side bitch right now, like she's just keeping me around for attention until she's found someone else (see #3).

5) I'm getting hella mixed signals here:

a) ""I'm into you and like you...""

b) ""... I don't see this going anywhere (to mutual friend)""


**My current understanding of this is:**

She's currently going after a dude (#3), she wants to keep me around as backup if things don't work out(5a), but in the case that her and other dudebro end up working out, she'll have an out (5b). 

**My questions for you:**

1) Is my understanding flawed or justified?

2) How should I act towards her from here on out?

3) If she wants to hang out again in the future do I accept or deny?

4) Thoughts, comments, concerns?

170722,Breakups,2jph9d,"First relationship after a rough split from my husband of 2 years. I thought he was a lot older, he thought I was a lot younger. I was interested in exploring my sexuality and just having fun, so the age difference wasn't enough to deter me from dating him. The young man has an old soul, and an emotional maturity that exceeds most of the men I've dated. 

We had an understanding in the beginning. This wasn't going to last, but that didn't mean we couldn't enjoy each other and have something fun and meaningful for a time. I told him a dozen times that I'm not interested in or ready for anything long term. He was fine with this and more or less on the same page in the beginning.

Our connection was really deep from the start. Let me just say that I have never experienced the kind of chemistry we had-- he blew my mind. He was the most attentive, sensual, confident, affectionate lover I've ever had. Things that came naturally to him drove me WILD, and vice versa. It was a phenomenal summer. We went on trips, we met each other's families, made new friends, volunteered together, explored the mountains and the city, spent many nights talking about dreams and life and how we might better the world.

As I said I was guarded in the beginning, not wanting anything serious. But he was persistent, and amazing. So I let him in a little bit. And then over the weeks and months, I fell in love with him and everything changed. He convinced me that he wanted me, the real me… and that he wanted a life with me. Life, babies, a home, the future; together. For the majority of our time together I refused to think about it. I didn't want to, and I told him so a dozen times or so. Then he went and wooed my heart and filled me with love and hope and goo and dreams of forever.

Six month mark came around and I started feeling the flight or fight urge... get out before it gets too hard, or stay and fight for it and go deeper. I decided I didn't want either, and was just going to stay in this happy place for as long as possible. Then a week later he came over and we had dinner and lovin' as usual, only this time he wanted to have a chat before he left. He told me through tears that he feels like he's holding me back, and bringing me down to his level in some way. In short, he said that he feels that I'm ready to pursue certain goals and build a life, and that I deserve to have someone who can give that to me. He said that he can't, he's in school and hasn't built anything in his life. The thing is, I just went back to school and won't be finished for 3 and a half years, and after that I plan to do a 6 month internship in S. America. I am in no way ready to settle down and start a family, as I said in the beginning.

I can't believe how heart broken I was. I've never been broken up with, but I don't know how much that's contributing. I've dated and been with a lot of men, and haven't experienced this kind of compatibility and happiness in a relationship before. I had my concerns about our age difference of course, and was afraid that if we did get serious he'd be missing out on a lot of experiences. Deep down I know that this is probably right, but I am having such a hard time letting it go. Getting a divorce was the most painful thing I have ever been through... but this is pretty close and I don't know why. 

He wanted to be friends and talk every day, text throughout the day, call me before bed and hang out as usual. So he came over two days after the breakup and I had to have breakup round two and tell him that it's just not possible. I can't flip a switch and stop loving him, and we need time to separate from each other. He didn't want to accept that, but I think he understood. It's a bit naive to think you can just continue on as usual, but this is his first serious relationship and break up so I can't blame him. He said he feels ""lost in the woods"". We both cried again.

I almost broke down and called him last night. It's been a week since breakup round two. I miss him so much. I went out on with a cruiser club in my neighborhood on Friday. Had a lot of flirty fun, and the attention felt good. But overall it made me feel hopeless, like I'll never find someone as amazing again. I couldn't stop thinking about him. I'm having a hard time focusing. We go to the same school and have mutual friends. I want to be on friendly terms and reach out eventually. He said he'd be waiting on me to contact him when I'm ready, and hopes that it's soon. I'm a damn mess, and I don't know what to do.

She moved to another city a year ago but whenever she comes back to our city (which is almost every weekend), she always asks him to come out. It is a 3 hours drive between her city and mine. They would go clubbing, bar hopping, karaoke together. I do not like to join them because I feel such an outsider whenever I go and I honestly just don't appreciate clubbing or karaoke. Sometimes the things he said would be quite flirty (IMO) but when I confronted him about it, he would say ""That's how I am. I am not trying to flirt. It's how I talk""

63329,Relationships,30m7dh,"My boyfriend of a year pulled some pretty unfaithful behavior about two months ago that I've forgiven him for and mostly moved past, but I'm having trouble getting over some lingering suspicion issues. Here's the situation:

We'd been dating for ten months when I discovered that he was talking to another girl. I'd seen him texting her once or twice before but pushed any questions out of my mind. One morning while getting ready for work, I pressed a button on his phone to see what time it was and he had two texts from her on the front screen. This was 7:30 in the morning and she'd already texted him  twice. One saying Hey! :-) and the other asking how his night had been. I instantly felt a little sick to my stomach, thinking there was a good chance she wasn't just a friend. 

I gathered the courage and asked him about it the next day. It turned out they had known each other several years. They met on a video game board and had connected and been fast friends. She lives about five hours away from us and is married (with a child). He admitted they had met up twice over the last few years and had sex, and also that she claimed to love him. He said he used to love her, or he at least thought he did, but he insists that what he felt for her doesn't compare to the way he feels for me. He also said they still talk every day. Usually not long conversations, but they do check in at least daily. He swore up and down that he didn't' love her, but I was obviously still bent out of shape. He had been with me for ten months and he didn't think to tell me about this girl? He didn't think it was important to mention that he talked every day to another girl who loved him and expressed love to him? So yeah, I was hurt. But I got over it.

 I told him that realistically he couldn't keep talking to her every day and have me stick around. I explained that it would make me feel secondary  and lesser, especially since I don't know if had been telling her he loved her or sexting her. I never read any more messages than the ones I saw on his screen, I just took his word for it. After explaining all of that, he readily offered to cut things off with her. 

Fast forward two months later, to now. He's told me he ended things with her and that they no longer talk, but I don't know how to truly believe him. I want to, but I feel like the only way to really know if I'm being lied to or totally fooled is to look through his phone. I've never been the kind of girl who snoops before, though, and I know I'll feel awful about myself after, regardless of what I find. 

I want to be in the relationship. Aside from the isolated incident, he's not proven himself to be untrustworthy. He was incredibly upset about hurting me like he did and he expressed many times that he wished he'd just told me about her from the beginning and that he knew was he was doing wasn't okay. Maybe it's just lip service, but I know this man pretty well and I believe him. The issue is just that it eats away at me sometimes to think about being so secure in our relationship and happy while all the while actually being clueless to what's happening. Maybe it's shallow or ridiculous, but I don't want to look stupid. I don't want to be the girl who had no idea what was really going on. And I guess I see the only option to circumvent that is to snoop, but apart from my moral issues with doing that, it also has many other downsides. Maybe the issue isn't my trust, but my pathological fear of looking stupid or being taken advantage of. 

In the same situation, would you snoop? Would you satisfy your urge to know whether or not you were being played? Or would you try to stay trusting and hope that if you are being betrayed, the truth will come out eventually?

175665,Dating,2fziux,"So I met this girl on OKCupid back on July 1st. We've went out on our first date and then since then we've just hung out and done things. We go bike riding occasionally and out for drinks with each other a few times. I've met her brother and sister in law and her nieces and nephews. I've hung out with her brother and sister in law at the bar and they seem to really like me. 

Just last week she asked me out to dinner so we went and had a great time. Afterwards I asked her if she wanted to go see the dueling pianos and she suggested we go to somewhere more ""chill"" so we ended up at the hookah lounge. The whole time all I could think about was ""I should kiss her."" But she seems kind of shy and never gave any big signs that she wanted me to. So a few days later I meet up with her at the bar and hang out with her and some of her friends. We all had a great time and I asked her to go see a movie with me tonight. Well I just got back and I had a plan to hold her hand in the theater and / or put my arm around her that eventually culminated in kiss. 

That didn't really work out. In the past when a girl was interested in me, she'd make it known by putting her hand in such a way that she showed me she wanted me to hold it. Or should would lean slightly towards me and I'd know that putting my arm around her was okay. 

Maybe I'm wussing out but I've never really had a problem before, and I don't want to make her uncomfortable if she just wants to be friends. 

We're getting together again this Thursday for a bike ride and this Saturday for a football game so I want to just let her know where I stand. I'm not confessing my love or infatuation for her or anything.

I had asked her to watch my daughter [2] for me and my wife so we could go out for the night on the condition she not smoke around my daughter. My wife and I quit smoking almost a year ago and don't want it around our kid for all kinds of reasons.

My mother said she'd smoke outside but that she couldn't make my dad do it. I told her I'd think about the situation and get back to her. Here is where I made my mistake: I asked my grandmother to watch my daughter instead since my parents keep smoke away from my kid. I did this without letting my mom know I wouldn't be bringing my daughter over. My grandmother said something to my mother before I could, and my mom lost it.

She sent me a text message almost immediately telling me to never ask her to watch my daughter again. I told her to calm down and that she was overreacting. I said my daughter was welcome to go over there as soon as both my parents were ready to not smoke around her. 

She texted me back and said something to the effect of, ""Forget I exist."" I told her to grow up. She texted back, ""F--- you. Don't ever talk to me again."" I told her again that she needed to grow up, that she owed me an apology and that she shouldn't contact me again until she was ready to give me that apology.

I immediately called my grandmother and sister and asked them not to meddle. They did anyway, but I wanted to get ahead of it so they weren't put in the middle. Through them, I've since found out that this has been a long time coming, that my mother has ranted to them for months about how I apparently have chosen my wife and her family over my own. According to my grandmother and sister, my mom thinks my wife has somehow brainwashed me and turned me against them in some way, despite the fact that I show up to all family functions. 

It should be noted that these three (my mom, grandmother and sister) speak with one another almost daily. I've never been that way. I'll go days, sometimes weeks at a time without speaking to any of them. Same goes for my wife's family. I work nights, so I don't get much opportunity to communicate with anyone during the week, and I spend my days off with my wife and daughter doing fun stuff since I miss out on so much during the week.

This was never an issue until 2012, when I graduated from college. Almost immediately, my mom and my dad started treating me differently. I was the first in my family to graduate high school, and when I became the first to get a college degree, it felt like I instantly became the black sheep of the family. I'm not sure if this is because I'm actually different (totally possible and maybe even the most likely scenario) or if they're imagining I'm something I'm not.

My mom's meltdown was at the beginning of January. Her birthday was a couple weeks later. I didn't call her and tell her happy birthday because she told me not to call her. I felt that was fair, and I was told by my family members still in contact with her that she was hurt by it but that they told her it was her own fault for telling me not to call her.

Now, my birthday is in a week. Up to now, I've done pretty well with keeping this from bothering me, but I'm starting to think she's actually going to skip out on calling her son on his birthday. I'm leaning toward making this rift in our relationship permanent if she doesn't at least call me next week to tell me happy birthday.

Anyway, When I was 17 i met a girl, We'll call her ""Dana"" and we really clicked and well we started dating and fell in love, blah blah blah. The relationship lasted for about 2 years. And it was great, I truly was so happy with her. Then all of a sudden it ended. And I was devastated, but I eventually got over her. I have dated a couple chicks after her, and they were okay. Just regular relationships that weren't anything serious. But then I found my current GF, ""Jane"". And I really enjoy being with her. She's great and we are both quite happy together.


But back to the reason I'm making this post. Jane and I, even though 5 months isn't a substantially long time for a relationship. I am having really strong feelings for her, and it's getting more serious. However, every time i'm left alone to my own thoughts I get an outstanding feeling of feeling like i'm not worth being loved because of Dana. I just feel like, sooner or late Jane is going to lose her feelings for me just as Dana did. And I'm normally not an insecure person as far as my self image is concerned. But just in this relationship, I feel like there isn't enough there y'know? 


So I would like to know, for people who've gone through rough breakups. How did you get over feeling like you weren't enough when you got into a new relationship?

I'm a mess. Sorry if it is incoherent. Posted this on r/offmychest first, but I decided I might want some advice, or just opinions on this.

My current boyfriend is amazing, we've known each other for about 5 years, but have been too shy to do anything about it, up until 5 months ago. 3 months ago we became official, and I couldn't be more happy about that. There's been zero drama, he's affectionate, and just a lovely boyfriend overall.

Now, there's always been lots of drama and absolute bullshit going on in my previous relationships. The last one was ridiculous. It only lasted 4 months, and she managed to dump me twice, cheat on me twice, and just treat me like shit in general. I honestly do not know why I was with her, just bad judgement I assume.

Sure, my other relationships affect my current one as well, but to go into that I'd need a throwaway... There's a specific thing I brought from the last one. 

The second and final time my ex-girlfriend broke up with me, it was mainly caused by peer pressure. Her friends told her and ""convinced"" her, she's a very weak person mentally, and I guess it was for the best but... Now I'm scared as shit that it will happen again. I am so afraid my boyfriend's friends dislike me, and want me out of the picture... I'm afraid that if this were the case, they'd convince him to leave me, make him doubt our relationship. I adore his friends, they're great, and I feel like I get along with all of them, but I'm afraid it is not mutual. 

I can understand if it sounds like I don't have such high thoughts regarding my boyfriend or his friends, but that is not the case. They're lovely, my boyfriend makes me happy, and things are great. I am ruining for myself.

I am so scared he'll leave me... I don't know what to do. I don't feel like he should like me in the first place. Why me? There are so many others that are much better, and actually worthwhile. I hate myself for all of this, I just keep ruining everything for myself. I don't feel like it would be fair to tell him about this either, because it might come off as a ""please don't leave me, you would make me super sad"", and I don't want to guilt trip him into staying, in case he does want to leave. I don't want him to think that I think he's like my ex-partners, he knows (almost) all about those train wrecks.

How the fuck am I supposed to do this... I feel like he'll eventually leave no matter what I do. I know I'm not actually good enough. He's too good for me. I feel like he won't put up with me being so insecure, flawed, and... I guess unlikable. He won't want to, nor should he, put up with my shit. I'm rambling. I'm sorry.

I'm in the US military, so my job takes up most of my time. The best case scenario is a 60 hour work week, 5 12 hour days, and I usually have to work later.

I do not have the time in a single weekend to actually maintain a decent environment.

Yeah, that's when she gets mad at me for not paying attention to her. My kindle is disruptive, my music is annoying, the TV show I watch means I'm not paying attention to her. She won't ask about things that happen to me or pay attention if I talk about them anyway. There's no physical affection, only demands and complaints. 

She got mad at me last night because I wouldn't get out of bed to go find her watch, which she allowed the dog to take from her some hours before, and then lost track of in the massive amount of mess she refuses to clean.

I got mad and told her that all she does is watch Netflix and let the dog piss everywhere, then went to sleep.

I promise you, this isn't a case of missing-the-best-friend. Christine and I have always been pretty independent of one another and we see each other just as frequently as we were seeing each other before her and Daniel started dating. 

First and foremost, Daniel is incredibly controlling. They had a pregnancy scare a month or two into the relationship, and he told her she would never have an abortion and was so disappointed that she wasn't pregnant (this rightfully freaked her out, but she played it off as cute). He is unemployed and has been for over a year, he claims he's applying for jobs in IT and although he doesn't have any schooling for it he says he doesn't need it because he knows it all. He of course, lives with his parents. He refuses to go out with her, stay at her house or socialize with her friends. Their evenings consist of smoking weed and some of his guy friends coming over and her cooking for him. I went to his house one time and hockey was on, I was talking quietly to one of Dan's friends and Christine told us to be quiet because Daniel was watching hockey and he hates it when people talk during the game. Daniel gets mad if Christine doesn't wear a bra, Daniel gets mad if Christine has a wall post on her FB from another guy.

Daniel recently came to our mutual friends birthday and proceeded to get into a 3 hour, audible screaming match with Christine during the party. It was incredibly cringe-worthy. He's not a kind person, he's arrogant and rude and all in all just a dick.

Lastly, we all hate him. All of us (Christine's best friends) cannot stand him. There is not one of us that supports her relationship. But Christine hasn't really been in an adult relationship before so we all fear it's the first-relationship-blindness.

Basically what should I (and the rest of our friends) do? We've vocalized our opinion (thoughtfully) to her and she totally seems to get why we don't like him yet she sort of shrugs it off? I just feel like she's getting sucked into something really shitty and I don't know if there is anything I can do except wait it out.

My biggest gripe is she never wants to dance with me and says I'm not a good dancer. I've asked her how I could be a better dancer so when we go to a club we could have fun but she doesn't know.

A week before we actually move from our previous apartment, April sustains a back injury. So this means that she cannot actually lift anything, but it turns into her not doing ANYTHING. No packing, no cleaning, nothing. Until I got pissed off enough and told her she needed to help. I recognize back injuries aren't fun, but there are things that she could be doing to help that won't hurt her back. She wouldn't even call the city to remove the garbage we left behind. 

The day we move, I move almost the entire apartment with my dad, brother, and boyfriend. April and Megan take 7 hours to wipe down the counters and sweep the floors. 

We move into the house, and it seems like everyone is getting themselves settled. Except all the sudden, it's only me putting shit away, while one complains of back aches and the other sleeps all day and then goes to work for a 5-12 shift, and claims to be too busy to do anything. Meanwhile, I work a 9-5 job, volunteer, and still manage to put the house together. 

It's been exactly a week and I've been the only one to actually do anything with the house. I understand that injuries are bad, but April has an extensive history of being ridiculous with illness and injuries. Stuffy nose? I guess that means I don't got to work for 3 days. Stubbed my toe? Can't walk. I'm not exaggerating, so you can see my hesitation in believing the extent of her injury. And to make it all even better, Megan coincidentally suffers from serious side pain that makes her not be able to do anything either, yet she can go to work, go get groceries, and do fun things with April and her family. 

Furthermore, when I'm not around, I can hear them laughing, enjoying the living room that I took 5 hours to put together, up and about, going out for a smoke, etc. But the minute they know I'm around, all I hear is oooohhh...my back. Agghhh...my back is so bad. I leave, and it all goes back to normal. 

And aside from the cleaning, I was the person who got us out of our old lease (after hours on the phone with the landlord and the tenancies board, as well as posting numerous ads looking for a subletter), renting the u-haul, paying hundreds of my own money in moving costs, found the new place, met with the current landlord (twice), paid for the damage deposit to get us in on time, plus more. And they can't call the city to get the garbage taken away. 

I freaked out on Saturday night in the kitchen with my boyfriend because I couldn't find anything I was looking for. There was garbage all over the floors, food was still in boxes. It was ridiculous. They heard everything. Naturally, I get a softened we really appreciate everything you've done last night, but the problem is I don't believe them. I feel like it was a pity pseudo apology in attempts to make me less pissed off at them. Though I've yet to get an actual apology. 

It's a six month lease, and I'm seriously considering telling them that I don't want to live with them anymore after that. 

Am I over-thinking this, or am I not wrong in thinking something is off.

My Bf and I are light swingers as I call it, we don't do the adult clubs, the house parties, the meet ups or the crazy vacations that swinging can be notorious for. We prefer to make friendships with people, and if it happens to go to the bedroom all the better (this will be relevant later) 

My BF the other day invited a single gal (J) out for a drink to meet both of us. She was a bit older( around 10 years our senior), and new to swinging. We like to meet people before to see what kind of chemistry presents itself. She met us for a drink at the bar that we usually frequent.

It wasn't a bad meet, she was nice, she looked like her pictures. We also ask questions to see if we would be a good fit or if it would be limited to a one night thing  (This is what we don't want). 

During the meet she told us about her swinging experiences, she has gone to several house parties (for those that don't know, house parties can vary from light playing to all out orgies) and had played with several men over a short period of time. She was rightfully asking questions regarding our history and how into swinging we are. 

It came to be known that I have a new friend( it hasn't gone all the way, but it has potential) and she asked to see a picture. I showed her. It happened that it was someone she had slept with at a house party and a few times after that. (Same pic, same phone number, def the same person). He had stopped talking to her abruptly about a month ago, which is about the same time he started talking to me. 

As soon as she found out the length of time we had been talking she started telling me all this dirt (that he uses a fake name at house parties, that he was so into her and clingy and needy, etc etc). 

We ended the night amicably and my SO and I returned home. He is unsure about continuing to speak with her as she seems to be very caught up in the more wild side of swinging, the house parties specifically.  

Since the other night, J has texted both My SO and I. To thank us for going out and also she keeps asking if I've talked to my friend. I'm unsure how to respond, so I haven't yet.

My friend N is away for the weekend, no cell service (or so I was told), he is unaware that I know about his recent sexcapades with this girl. We hadn't really discussed our lifestyle history yet, but I also have reservations about having a FWB that treats swinging like a fucking sport(literally). He told me what he was looking for first, so the things that she was telling me, it doesn't seem like the same person. 

So ideas anyone? Best way to bring this up?  

And please refrain from the Isn't swinging/ open relationships about fucking people comments yes that is obvious, this is not a normal situation, I'm not exactly tactful sometimes so I am looking for ideas. Also thank you in advance but I am aware about the increased risk for STD's etc.

Then one day, I got a full time job. I kept my other job as well, but for the longest time my manager there wouldn't put me on the schedule (at the time, other people had more flexible hours than I). With two jobs and full time school on my end, I can obviously see why we drifted apart some. Still, we  talked all the time and managed to hang out.

Recently though, she's been single and I just moved in with my boyfriend of one year, so our times are spent differently. I still have plenty of time to hang out with her, especially since they've been working me at my part time job more often, but we still never hang out. I mean, my place is a 6 minute walk from work and less than a 1 minute drive down the road, and we still can't hang out? What?

••

She's sending me mixed signals though, as she is usually the one to approach me and say something like, ""Hey! We should have a movie night!"" We've been saying that we'll have a movie night for over a year, to no avail. We'll make plans to do these things or she'll get me really excited to do something, but then she'll say at a later time that she's too tired or just doesn't bring it up again. So SHE is the one that makes the plans, but SHE is also the one that cancels. 

••

At first, I thought it was just me because obviously my life is crazy busy, but I suddenly remembered that I'll make plans like to go out for my birthday and she's all for it, but then later she cancels because maybe she's too tired or something. Shoot, I'll even clear my schedule for the day to hang out but she still flakes. Even though she makes the plans 80% of the time, she still cancels when I come up with something. That's why I've given up making plans with her.

••

So here's where I get a little confused and annoyed: she's starting to hang out with our manager more. Like, they actually got off of work yesterday, drove an hour out of town and got tattoos. You can't find an hour or two to hang out with me, yet you spent like 5 hours out of town yesterday getting a tattoo? I'm not saying she can't make plans with other people or even have other friends, it's even understandable that they hang out so much because they work together all the time. But it's like why does she even make plans with me at all if she doesn't want to hang out? One time, I saw on Facebook that they had a movie night. I cried. 

••

So, we text all the time and hang out once every blue moon, but I just don't understand why she cancels our plans so frequently. I should also mention she lives 25 minutes away, but the manager lives 35 minutes away. It's not like they're next door neighbors and neither are we. I know she's not skipping out on me and hanging out with the manager because I see on Facebook that she's just chilling at home, which I see in passing when I read Facebook shit to see who's engaged of pregnant this week. 

••

I feel like I've been very understanding (or naïve) for over a year up until this point, as I know that lives get hectic and sometimes you're really just not up to hang out. I'm not asking to chill like every day all the time, but this whole cancellation thing has happened enough that I felt like I needed to seek advice on the matter. 

••

I know I need to talk to her, but here's a couple of things:
1. I still work with her, so I don't want to make things awkward. 
2. I don't want to make her feel obligated to hang out with me. At that point, I'd rather be alone. 
3. I don't want to come off as insensitive to her problems (maybe she's depressed? Maybe she's tired from working all the time?)

Over the next two weeks he brings her up a few times when he is talking about work, but he alsways says something like The girl at my office...I think her name is Becky In my head I'm thinking You KNOW her damn name, stop acting like you dont!

I am a firm believer that people (especially men) will tell half truths when they are doing something they shouldnt be, and this is why he tells me about having to deal with her, but pretends he cant remember her name.


Truthfully, I feel like he is either cheating on me, or trying to figure a way to cheat.
Here are the reasons I think this...
1) Aside from the name thing I mentioned above, he suddenly got VERY interested in one specific sexual thing that he was NEVER interested in before, and by VERY interested, I mean it's all he talked about.


2) He has a phone for work, his boss provides Iphones for all the employees and one day, out of the blue he says I got a weird message on my work phone today, it was from some woman telling me she wanted something and that was the end of the conversation, he changed the subject. This again, goes along with my theory that half truths are being told.


3) We car pool together because we live very far away from the town we both work in, it's actually a different state, right across the border. One day when I was pulling up to get him I was a little early, and I could swear that I watched him and one of the women walk away from her car and around to the front of the office. I was so completely caught off guard that I didnt really register what I was seeing, and truthfully, I would not swear that it was him. I just thought wait, did I just see that?



4) I have caught him without his wedding ring at least 3 times in the last 2 weeks.

5) This morning I was dropping him off, Becky pulls in behind us, gets out of her car and glares at me, waits until I start to turn my head and does this little wave thing to my husband.

All of this combined with the fact that I just have this feeling in my gut that something is going on, and I am about to flip out.


I keep trying to bring this up with him and he gets mad, like SO mad that he will not even talk to me about any of it, and accuses me of just trying to start crap. 


Tell me Reddit if I am just crazy, please.

TL:DR  I think he's cheating, he tells me I'm nuts. Help!

I will update as soon as I have some final answers, either from him or from uh...I think her name is Becky?

Edit part deux...


Everyone keeps asking if uh...becky is it, knows that he is married. I would assume that she does, because he does wear a ring, however, a few weeks ago right after I brought this all up with him he was really mad, mad enough that he went to work and called me from his office, yelling at me and saying some really shitty things,  he made no effort to hide our conversation from all of his co-workers, which was incredibly shitty of him.

Okay, first, a preamble: I know I'm overweight.  I am aware of the health risks to watch out for.  My weight is something I've been working on for literally 12 years, and it is **DAMN HARD** for me to both lose weight and keep it off.  I have a doctor, I have a gym membership, I have a dietitian, I have a therapist, and I do my best to follow their advice.  Thank you in advance for your concern I'm offering any weight loss or exercise tips you may choose to offer, but I am only following the advice of the qualified professionals I already have established relationships with.  The only kind of advice I'm looking for is about my relationship with my boyfriend.

So.  I'm overweight.  Shortly after we started dating, my boyfriend told me he prefers overweight women.  The first time we were intimate, he paid a *lot* of attention to my belly, which I was very uncomfortable with, since I'm not exactly proud of my weight *or* my belly.  Thankfully, that wasn't all he did, and he was good enough in other ways (both inside and outside of the bedroom) that I decided to stay with him.  As time went on and I got more comfortable with him, the belly-attention slowed somewhat (yay communication!) and I got more comfortable with it.

Then I got into a solid groove with a workout class that I liked and started to lose and keep off a little more weight.  My belly started to slim down, and he paid it less and less attention.  Then I lost my job, and while that meant I had to cut the class to keep expenses in line, it also meant I couldn't afford to eat out as much, and I also took to running as a stress-reliever, and I got even thinner (but by no means ""thin"").  Sounds great, at least physically, doesn't it?  Except he became even less interested in sex, I always had to initiate, and tensions started to run high.

Fortunately, I wasn't out of work long, maybe four months in all, and started a new job in March of this year.  More time working meant both more money (yay, lucre!) and work-related stress: I was working later, so I had to (and could afford to) eat out more, I ran less, and I started putting weight back on.

And he became much more interested in sex.  And he's gone back to belly-fixation.

I'm starting to realize that he just has a fat fetish.  If I'm not fat, he's not interested.  When I'm feeling *best* about my body )""(how it looks, what it can do, etc.), he's at his least interested.  And when he's interested, not only is it in my body at its worst, but he also zeroes in on the fattest parts, the parts I feel the most shame and disgust over.  He's literally in love with the worst parts of my body!

What kills me is that, apart from this fetish, he's a great and supportive partner.  He stayed with me after I got laid off, he's been right in there in the muck with me through some serious emotional distress, and he's fun to be around.  But his fat fetish still kills me, because we can never *both* be happy with how I look, not without him either suddenly not liking overweight women or me suddenly not wanting to lose weight.  He's always going to want to kiss and put his hands on a fat belly, to draw attention to the part of my body I like least and hate most.

I don't know if I can or should put up with that.  Is this something to leave him over?

6568,Relationships,2vsmy5," Ok well I don't really have any rl friends at this point who I wish to talk about this with about so I am asking for help to basically anyone who will listen on here, sorry if this is long I am trying to give the full insight though for proper response. I'm a [21/f] and before this current relationship I had a long hard and really bad relationship with my ex were he left me feeling extremely jaded towards other men for a year. 

My good friend from hs told me of how she met her fiancee at the time(now husband) on this phone app so I decided to try it out since they seemed really happy. No one really caught my eye except this one guy who had common interests as me so we decide one day after talking for a while to meet up at a mutual location, and when I meet him in person everything is great he is very handsome and we have so much in common.

 The only thing was that he was a little shy but after a few months of dating we become like best friends and talk about everything. There's only one problem and that is that he has also felt betrayed by his ex but instead of like me and moving on he carries that resentment into his relationship with me and he feels I shouldn't have any guy friends at all since she did and she cheated on him. So he gets rid of his girlfriends and deletes all his social media expecting me to do the same. Well I do delete all my social media but I have a guy best friend that I've had in my life for like 5 years(i'll just call him Carl). It's a strictly platonic relationship we usually just talk about things and smoke weed and watch movies or play pool at his home bar type setup where alot of mutual friends come by so it's like a hangout spot,he was also with my girl best friend a while ago and I met him through her so even if I thought he was dating material (which he isn't my type at all) I wouldn't date him because my friendship with my girl best friend would go to hell for breaking our friend code. Although my bf wanted me to stop hanging out with all males beside him I hid it from him and continued to secretly hang out with Carl thinking it was ok as long as I wasn't cheating and he wouldn't get all concerned and I wouldn't have to lose my best friend. Well one night I had a couple of drinks and it was late and I didn't feel like walking home so I spent the night on Carl's couch and he respectively slept in his bed. My mom was texting me that night saying dumb Kardashian quotes and asking when I was coming home. I told her the next morning  and she said you never get enough huh speaking of alcohol. Some weeks later my bf goes through my phone saying my mom was covering for me because I was cheating on him and that he was pissed so he was going to get revenge calling me all kinds of names: slut,bitch,whatever else you can think of. Also besides that I went to a concert and got a little drunk and ended up in the hospital which he thinks I got roofied and was raped by a security guard which is hardly unlikely because it was a huge concert and people were everywhere it was an outside event and the ambulance was there to take me to the hospital in like 10 minutes.,but that happened to hi ex and he thinks I'm like the same. 

I admit those things were in the beginning and yes I had a bit of a drinking problem but have since gotten over it I barely ever drink and if so it's totally in moderation and I stopped talking to Carl altogether and have dropped all social media and even changed my phone number so basically I get no contact with anyone besides my bf. Things were going well so far for the past few months but I forgot before my mom got a new car I was at the store a while back and had a lot of things I had bought and ran into an old acquaintance like a friend of a friend and he gave me a quick ride home with my things seeing i was struggling carrying stuff. I didn't see it as a big deal as it was just a nice gesture and had forgotten about such since it was a few months ago last year but as I was at the store the other day with my bf  he came up behind us and said hi. Like I said my bf is really jealous and I was kinda stoned so I was a little taken back and didn't know how to address the friend with my bf there (my bf doesn't think welcoming hugs are ok) but it is a small town and everyone does that here but I didn't do such i just awkwardly introduced my bf and in return the acquaintance like exploded for some reason saying  whatever then (my name) you act so cold like i don't even know you and i gave you a ride home a few months back! and walked away to another checkout. Honestly he was being a fucking prick and yeah I took a ride from him but that was it and he had no right to go off on me like that but i was a little to stoned to argue. My bf was furious though I could see it in his face but he's more of a texting warrior never really says anything to my face. So when we go back to my house we were supposed to hang but he says he's going home and later that day he sends me all these texts calling me a slut and how dare I take a ride home from any other guy and that I must be sleeping with him and he believes I was cheating on him with Carl because I spent the night there that one time. Then he tells me he got revenge a while ago with his ex and some other girl a few towns away and I am heartbroken.

 Sometimes I wonder if he is bi-polar though because he is always changing his mind and says he didn't cheat but doesn't believe me when I say I haven't so he wants me to feel the same doubt. I do to because the time he said he cheated with his ex I was out of town with a girlfriend attending a cosplay event and kept sending pics to ease his mind and show him i wasn't with or around any guys and he never answered my texts or calls. Maybe I shouldn't have gone but my friend already paid for the hotel and my ticket so I didn't want to turn down her offer but now I don't know and am stuck in my own thoughts wondering if he really did cheat. He has alot of trust issues in his past and it stems up from his parents infidelity and his past relationships and I feel he takes it out on me unfairly. I know it was wrong for me not to drop my friendship with Carl and spend the night but it was nothing more than me sleeping on the couch and I am since trying to be the best gf I can be but I've never been with someone so controlling so for him that ride home I took was a big no-no and he believes I cheated when I really didn't. He says he also has a co-worker he thinks is pretty and they smoke weed together in his car on his break but he wouldn't be with her cause she has 3 kids already but thinks she's better than me because she basically at least admits she's a slut when I won't (because honestly I haven't been his ideal perfect gf but I have never cheated so I don't see myself as a slut and won't say I am)We are since talking it out over text and he says he wants to hang today and have make-up sex but is it wrong for me to not want that, I keep thinking of him with other girls and its grossing me out. What should I do? Can I change his jealousy, am I the one at fault here for being so selfish and wanting to keep my friend only to end up losing all of them in the end? I feel so alone and I can't look to friends for help because I have none left. Please help

So it's been about 4 or 5 years since I was in a legitimate relationship with someone, and I started dating this girl just over 3 months ago. I really like her, and she says she really likes me and is falling for me, and we have a lot of fun.

The other guy she works with, says she went on a date or two, and he was weird so nothing happened.

Is it normal for girls to do this? Like I said, it's been a while since I've been in a relationship with someone, so I'm not sure what the norm is now a days. But it just slightly irritates me that she feels the need to text these guys, and sometimes she'll text them right next to me.

72951,Breakups,1wzavx,"firstly, we've been together for nearly exactly 1 year, she has made me happier than i ever thought was possible,she is the kindest, most beautiful and most intelligent lady i have ever met. 

over the past few months there have been things that happened and, together, we worked through them and i was always there for her, but because of all that stuff and one recent thing that happened, she needed to get a break and wanted to fly out to visit some friends

at this point due to college exams and family i hadnt seen her or spent time with her for a month, so i was really anxious to do so. the one day that we had planned to spend together we had to cancel because her monther was flying home 2 days later, which i do understand, i saw her crying because of how much she missed her mother, i didnt want to be the guy who would make her feel bad because of having to cancel. its not fair. 

Two days after her mother had left, she was going to be flying to  England to spend about 5 days with 2 of her friends there,which should have been no big deal. but as time went on, i began to miss her more and more, and became more selfish and jealous that it wasnt me who she was spending that time with, whenever i would try to talk to her i could only use whatsapp, so she could have no internet or might not see it, and when she could, on most days i would get maybe 30-40 minutes of her time to talk a day because she would be doing so many things. that didnt help me not feel abandoned. 

on the second last day there i was sending her messages in the morning wanting to make sure she got home safe the night before, but the messages werent getting through to her, so i got worried and sent a text hoping she would see it and know i was worried. eventually when she did we started talking for a bit, all was going okay until i said that i would give her some space to enjoy her last last 2 days there (i didnt realise that the next day would be travelling, not being with her friends) to which she replied yea, now that it's my last day xD 

now, 1 day prior to that exchange i asked her if she felt i was boring or had very little fun with me when we spent time together because she was having such a great fun time with her friends going out drinking every night, not getting hammered, just drinking and having fun. i just wanted her to have as much fun with me as she did with them, because ive never heard her be as excited with me as she was with them. in hindsight those were questions i could have asked when she got home, but the jealousy and selfishness on my part wanted to do something to get a bit more attention from her than a few minutes every morning. 

so back to the exchange of texts that led to a big blow up between us, during which i told her that i was upset that even though i was invited to go by her friends, she never asked me to go when she had got it sorted, we had made plans to go, about 2-3 months ago, but i wasnt sure if i could afford it yet, so i was waiting for dates and costs from her so i could plan it. then about 2 weeks before she went, she had the tickets bought for her by her dad,and told me the date, but never asked if i was still up for going, and since then she still didnt ask. which i took to mean that she didnt want me there and only wanted to be with her friends since the last time i was included she was very cold to me and would barely hug me around them. which is a reasonable request, but after not spending a single day with her for over a month, all i wanted was to spend time with her. even if i had to fly to England to do it. 

this led to a big argument... 

now she is back from England and is barely talking to me but tomorrow she wants to meet up and talk... and im terrified that i have ruined things so much that she will end it... she has been the greatest thing to happen to me in my entire life, and i would give absolutely anything to not have her end it... but at the same time i know it was my fault... and i wouldnt blame her for breaking up with me. ive been a crying mess for the past 3 days, with my phone next to me waiting for any message from her, hoping i get to it quick enough so i can have a little bit of a conversation with her at the same time, maybe find out if she resents me and if she plans to break up with me.. I need help... i know i dont deserve it, but i need help to stay with the woman that i know deep down that i love more than anything.

I get upset and he gets defensive, saying he just felt uncomfortable with the situation and he didn't want to be rude… I still think it was unacceptable because if a guy had done that to me, I would have politely told him I was with a date and would like to go dance with my date. Anyway, the whole situation never really gets resolved because he still feels like he handled it the best way he could. 

**Incident 2**: We go out with friends and he walks up to a random group of girls and asks them to dance on the pole thats on stage. He hold a girls hand and tries to assist her even though she says she doesn't want to. Seeing how she repeatedly says no, he walks away. 

**Incident 3**: He constantly is adding women on Facebook (women he barely knows), liking their photos, and sometimes even commenting on them. But they aren't really friends… that's what weirds me out. I've never heard him mention ANY of these women. If they were friends, I wouldn't care as much, but they are people he's met briefly. And ALWAYS women. He seems like the type that needs attention/validation from women? possibly? I'm not the type to need attention/validation from strange men.. So I'm not sure how I should feel about this quality.

**Problem right now**: He's never really been affectionate and now it's been three weeks since we've had sex. I try so hard. I give him fully body massages, I cook and bake for him, I give him space (I'm an introvert so I prefer alone time), we hardly EVER fight, I love to give blow jobs, and am open to exploring our sex lives. I just feel like he's not attracted to me :( I initiate A LOT. Most of the time. I've been rejected a lot so I've stopped because I don't want to pressure him and make him feel bad. I've tried to talk to him about our sex life and he says he's attracted to me but that he just doesn't want to have sex.

This problem coupled with previous instances have made me feel insecure. What should I do? I'm feeling insecure and I'm not usually like that! Really. I never EVER make him do anything he doesn't want to do. I CONSTANTLY encourage him to hang out with his friends and have guys night. AND if he does invite me along, I'll even walk away and get a drink so that he can play wingman to his single friend! I can't believe I'm feeling insecure over him liking another couple of Facebook selfies. I feel really stupid and childish.

He has about 6 really close friends who he sees very frequently. One of them was in a relationship for 6 years and then it ended, and since then the guy (we'll call him Jo) hasn't been able to get a girl, he doesn't want a girlfriend but can't find a girl to like him to even hook up with him.

Jo always goes to my boyfriend for help with this because I guess out of the whole group my boyfriend is the least shy and is very chatty and outgoing. Anytime they're out together, my boyfriend has to go up to a group of girls and start talking with them in hopes that Jo and one of the girls will start talking. (They've been out twice where I wasn't there and my boyfriend tells me then that he was talking to these girls and what they were talking about etc) 

Its not the fact that he's talking to women, its the fact he's basically giving them the impression he's single.

I just came back from a date with my boyfriend and he says that he feels really bad for Jo and that he tries his best to get him to talk to girls. I feel very uncomfortable about this. My boyfriend is basically acting intrested and pretending he's single just so Jo can try get a girl.

I met my wife online and she was a smoker. I utterly despise smoking and told her then that is me or the cigarettes. 

**Edit: Let me clear this line up. When I met her I never had any idea that she smoked. She had asked me how I felt about smokers and I dropped this line on her, while not knowing she smoked. After she moved to Australia she told me she quit smoking for me. I never knew she smoked from when I met her and never even asked the question. As I stated.. it was probably 6 months after talking to her online when she  came to Australia that she told me.**

Fast forward to a couple months ago she has been getting stressed at work and said she feels like smoking again. She had not smoked for 9 years between when we met and now.

She said people at work smoked and its been making her want to. She would ask questions like 'how would i feel about it if i stayed smoking again?' I would reply telling her that she already knows the answer to that.

Over the last month or so I started to smell what to me smelt like cigarette on her breath. However it was very light and concealed well. I asked her about it and she said it's from everyone else smoking at work around her. I felt like i knew better but i didn't want it to be true.  I believed she knew better as well as she has some current health issues and we're trying for a baby. She also really hates when mothers smoke around their kids so i thought she knew better. 

Come to today... I've come home from work and went to our room to get changed. I saw a pack of cigarettes on the floor next to our dresser.  I kicked it under the dresser and got changed. I thought about what this means, i even made excuses for her in my head. Then decided fuck it.  I picked it up and asked her 'what's  this?'

Her response was i don't know at first. Then quickly changed to 'how did that get there' then to 'it's mine'. I was so furious because i really hate smoking but she had lied to me. 

She does tell little lies every now and then and i hate it but this was a big lie. I asked her so a couple times if it was hers and how long she was smoking for and I knew she was lying even more. She said she bought it today. I opened the pack and about 4 cigarettes are missing. I know she is lying I've smelt it on her breath for weeks, maybe months. 

I threw the pack with as much strength as i could muster at the wall (I really wanted to throw it at her though because of how angry I was). I left the room. 

Half an hour later she is watching videos on her phone which made me really angry because i feel like she doesn't care. I asked her if she care at all. I didn't get a response. I told her that I'm more angry then I've ever been and that i find it hard enough to trust her half the time how can i trust you now at all. I also told her that despite anything we've been through in the past this is the worst thing she had ever done. 

I can't even be in the same room as her I'm so angry at what she has done and i don't know if i can trust her anymore. I've never been so angry that i actually don't know what to do.

**Update:** Thanks to some of you for actually giving me some advice instead of straight up insulting me. Yes I used the word angry too many times and I had an emotional response to the situation. I did not know what to do that's why I thought of posting on reddit for some advice. Trying to figure out what to say to her now though..

44578,Breakups,3bwicf,"Using a throwaway for reasons. I'll try to describe our 3 year relationship to just give some background. We started dating in college (our first real relationship) and had... quite a few hardships. Studying abroad, him travelling a lot for work/sport related things, and more or less, never making me a priority over his work/sport (he's a professional athlete). Never the less, we tried to make it work, but fell apart after I graduated from college and was offered a job 2 hours away where he wouldn't follow me as his job/sport was more important. We've always been open about things and communicate probably more than necessary, so it wasn't a huge surprise to anyone when we mutually called it off. Unfortunately, trying to keep this as vague as possible as his job/sport is very specific, but, during our three years, I became relatively involved in his job/sport and the community. I found myself organizing events and becoming super engaged with that part of his life and eventually becoming my own person within the community. I wasn't just his girlfriend, but rather an accepted and welcomed member (even though I didn't participate in the sport.) 


Flash forward to where we are now, we've been broken up for 8 months and it's starting to become 'sport season'. We have had our fair share of keeping in touch lunches or phone calls as we don't completely hate each other (every other month or so?) but now I'm expecting to see him quite a bit more and especially at this week long event that we both co-organize with 5 other people. So contact has increased. Problem is, he's got a fairly serious girlfriend from my understanding. Yes, I've dated around and would say I have a boyfriend right now (new relationship), but he has continued to not call her his girlfriend in front of me ever. Which I find strange. I can see how serious they are based on social media and mutual friends. Anyways. Our agreement, for this particular event, as we will be around each other so much, is to not bring either of our SO's to avoid conflict and unnecessary drama.  This was an agreement made months ago. 

As I'm sure you can guess where this is going, the agreement is practically null at this point because his new girlfriend sees me as a threat I would imagine. It's not exactly normal to remain friendly and work with your first love. I get it. I also get the feeling he still thinks I have this slight hope we'll get back together? So he's on edge about things even more. 


My question is; What is the best way to seriously communicate I'm not interested in dating him so for one, his girlfriend isn't a psycho when we do meet (I already get the feeling she hates me due to other reasons; The ex and I have been more in contact lately as we work out events and friend gatherings because we share the same friends. We try to let the other one know if we're going to be at a place ahead of time. So yeah, she hates that.), and two so he can calm down about us spending time together as we work this event? 

I really want to be an adult here and say having her around at the event wouldn't bother me, but it will, but I'm not his girlfriend anymore so I'm not looking to control him and tell him, no you can't bring her. I do feel slightly disrespected because he's backing down on our agreement, but it is what it is. Any insight on how to handle this situation? We have a meeting planned tonight to talk (him and I) about how we're going to handle the event, and I really want to lay it out as clearly as possible to show him this is strictly professional and I'm asking for respect when I don't want to see him and her making out on the sidelines all day haha. 

Phew, hoping that covers everything. It's quite the complex situation. 

TL;DR Ex (27M) and I (24F) will be spending time together this summer due to event organization within his sport. He wants to bring his new girlfriend around, but I want to kindly ask for respect if he does that. Furthermore, convince him I'm really not interested in him anymore, so he can get this chip off his shoulder, and we can move forward and be friends like adults.

1126,Breakups,36mzo2,"Full story: In November my girlfriend of a little under two years broke up with me, and I've been having a tough time getting back on my feet ever since. I'll preface this by saying I've been in a decent amount of relationships since high school, the longest of which being three years, and I've never had a breakup affect me like this. 

I started dating (whom we'll call) Kate right before my last semester of college. I was dating a different girl (the three year relationship) and we were getting set to move down South where she grew up after graduation, where we had a house and jobs lined up. Long story short, I was starting to feel like things between her and I were getting sort of flat and starting to second guess if I wanted to commit to having that future with her, so when Kate came along it really started to make me question what I wanted in a relationship and what I wanted for myself.

Kate and I worked together at a grocery store. She was in an emotionally and physically abusive relationship, and we became friends and talked a lot about what love meant and how to be happy and things like that. We started going to the gym together and it became apparent that we had a deeper connection than just friendship, so I (somewhat tortured by the decision of leaving a sure future with someone I definitely could have had a future with to gamble on something I thought I felt strongly about) broke up with my girlfriend and started dating Kate.

Things between Kate and I progressed very quickly, and I can honestly say I've never reached a level of comfort to that extent ever before, let alone at that speed. Things were pretty amazing, and we were planning for the future after she graduated from college. Things cooled down a little bit passion-wise, but I think that's to be expected in most relationships. 

On a few occasions she would question our relationship and we came close to breaking up a few times. I never really understood these episodes, and the only reason she could give was that something didn't feel right. In November (on Thanksgiving actually), she broke up with me and said it was for good over text, but that we could remain friends, which we did, even maintaining the sexual component. Right after Christmas she begged me to come over one day and I begrudgingly obliged, despite wanting to watch football and spend the day by myself. That night I found out she had feelings for her boss, and this culminated in a huge fight. I felt really used, but I couldn't bring myself to not talk to her anymore. She continued to sort of lead both of us on (her boss had a girlfriend, and she said she didn't want to do anything with him until that wasn't the case, she was also confused because I was still in the picture sort of). 

I got sort of tired of the situation and told her I wasn't going to do it anymore, but this turned into a weird talk about how much fun we'd had and we ended up sneaking into my parents' house to have sex at like 2 in the morning. For a while this kept up as well. We got a couples massage, I would drive to her school (about an hour away) sometimes to hang out.

Then suddenly it dried up and she pushed me away and I didn't know why. Turns out her boss had broken up with his girlfriend and she's sort of dating (I guess, read fucking) him. We got in a huge fight about how she has to do what's right for her and doesn't owe me anything and didn't lead me on and now we aren't talking.

Since the November breakup I've felt really lonely. Even with the friendship maintained I felt myself slipping into a depressive state. I started seeing a therapist and got on anti-depressants (which I don't think are doing anything). A lot of my friends have moved away (as is expected when you're 24) and as a naturally shy, and somewhat social-anxiety inhibited person I've found it hard find things to do or ways to connect with new people. The bar scene isn't really for me. I joined a softball league, but I haven't really made any lasting friendships there, and don't really foresee that happening. I really only have one friend left in the area, and a small handful of friends from high school/college that I still text occasionally. I work at a very small publishing company, where my only coworkers are a guy who works off site and my boss, who only comes in once every few days, so I'm alone in my office all day. I'm also moving out of my parents' house at the end of the month and living on my own.

I've had people break up with me before, but it's never affected me like this. The thought of her being with him is killing me. It's gotten to the point where I don't really enjoy the things I usually do (sports, video games, reading, writing, movies, making music) because I can't focus on them and I know I'm going to slip back into a natural depressive state after, and obsess about the thought of them together. I legitimately feel like it's taking years off my life. Therapy makes me feel better for a brief time, but once I'm on my own it hurts again.

Have any of you gone through anything like this? What helped you get over it? How do you connect with people if you're shy/somewhat socially inhibited, particularly in a somewhat rural area (I live in New York's Hudson Valley)?

120826,Relationships,1fvp61,"This is really long, sorry.

At the start of our relationship, I messed up big time. Then I messed up again a couple of months later. I don't know why I did it because I've never even thought about it before, but I slept with someone that wasn't my girlfriend. I got myself into bad situations and didn't have the mindframe to gtfo.

Anyway. That plays into my current situation because back then my girlfriend started questioning me constantly about who I was texting, who I was Skyping with, who I was talking to on Facebook, where I actually went if I went to my parents' house or a friend's, etc. Not until 4 months after I cheated did I try to talk to her about working on the trust issues and trying to move past it. I understand that it takes time to get over and it hurts, so I was never crude or harsh about progressing past my mistakes.

My girlfriend, ever since I cheated, has constantly been antagonistic and makes jokes about my mistakes. This leads to some fights because I try to talk to her and make sure she's okay, and she hates being open with anyone, which also bothers me because she just says ""nothing"" when I ask what's wrong, but then later will be like ""why didn't you comfort me when I was upset earlier?"" and such. Anyway. When we fight, she always says that I'm a ""shitty boyfriend"" and treat her ""like shit"", and that I ""don't do anything for"" her, which I don't get because I've stopped half of my life (I was working towards achieving a couple dreams of mine that took me away from her, and I've since given them up to make sure she knows I want to be with her), and I do a lot of stuff for her i.e. cleaning the house while she's at work, walking our dog that she wanted, doing yardwork, I surprise her with flowers and she absolutely loves snocones from a little shack here so I surprise her with those also. I try my hardest to be a really good boyfriend anyway, but especially because of our past.

Now, the current issue I'm having is this...
A couple years ago my gf's best friend killed himself. She misses him all the time, but it gets really bad around the anniversary of it happening. This year on the anniversary, I wasn't at her house because I had a final early in the morning, so she told me she was just going to stay home and be alone.

But she didn't. She went to a guy's house that she had feelings for throughout high school, but they never got together. However, he has feelings for her still, which she knows via him asking if there was a chance she'd leave me for him. She got drunk with him, and for a week before this happened I had a bad feeling like she was cheating on me (they had been hanging out a couple times before this, which I was cool with because she's never given me a reason to not trust her apart from a couple ""small"" lies, but it still made me nervous I guess). She started acting weird and distant, not really being affectionate like we use to (we use to have sex at least 4 times a day and if we weren't having sex we were making out or cuddling, but she barely gives me pecks and even holding hands doesn't happen).

3 days after that night, I surprise her by coming over early, but she was at a female friend's house (""supposedly""). I found a condom wrapper behind her bed that she swears was mine and hers (I can believe this because it was the same type of condom, I was just pretty sure we had cleaned everything out), but she did have something to tell me... She told me she went and got drunk with the guy, and said that they made out. She said ""I was really drunk and we made out but only for like 5 seconds before I realized it wasn't you"".

And this is sort of weird, I guess, but when we were having sex two days before (would be the day after it happened) her vagina smelled weird, and her clothes smelled like a guy. I also went through her phone (major issue there, I know, but she does it to me all the time and in light of being cheated on and a lot of other ""evidence"" that people consider signs of cheating, I did it) and found nude photos that I had never seen, and a photo of them together, where she was smiling while he was ""hugging"" her. She pulled the phone out of my hand when I got to that picture and deleted all of her pictures. She said she wasn't smiling and that he did that and one of their mutual friends had it planned to take the picture and that if I kept going, I would see stuff that would make me more upset, and that the nude photos were for me but for some reason she never sent them (same for all the regular pictures she had of herself that were new).

She had small bruises on her upper arms, which she said were from him ""trying to take advantage of"" her. But she said as soon as she realized it wasn't me she was kissing, she got up, threw her phone and hit him in the face (good aim to be that drunk), and the phone shattered. But somehow she called a friend to come get her. She claims she was completely wasted, but then her stories involve [near] sober coordination and contradictory actions (breaking phone, calling friend).

Now, I wouldn't really have an issue if any of this was believable. After all of this happened, she kept talking to the guy, a LOT. She had a bunch of phone calls to him (which she denied, even though I told her I looked in her call log) and a bunch of texts, even when we were in bed together she would roll away to hide her screen and text him. Also, while she did nothing but bombard me with questions of who I was talking to, where I was going, etc when I cheated, if I even mentioned her cheating she would start yelling at me and telling me I needed to act like a man and get over it. She told me it was okay she did it because she was drunk, and even if she wasn't I had cheated before so I had no right to be upset.

So I did get over it. I've been holding all of it in since then (it happened around May 5). But the other night I was posting a status on her facebook (something we do to each other) and saw a message from her to the guy.. It said ""Text me. I got in some drama and threw my phone and it shattered"", dated May 5. I asked her about what drama she got in, in the morning and she told me (after yelling at me) that she lied to him because she didn't want to just say she deleted his number (even though she deleted him on Facebook then readded him), and that it was dated March 5, not May 5 (but I reconfirmed last night that it was May 5).

So now it's all back in my mind again. I managed to push it out by gaming a lot and watching a lot of tv, but now it's back in the forefront of my mind and driving me crazy. So my question here is... is this really what I think it is? Everything points to her having a prolonged affair and not really wanting to be with me other than for me basically being a butler (driving her everywhere even though her car gets better mileage, buying her stuff, doing all of the housework and yardwork, etc).

**tl;dr::** GF never use to use makeup, but all of a sudden she started buying it and being obsessed with looking good; she starts hanging out with someone she knows has feelings for her and even gets drunk with him and ""makes out"" with him; yells at me/calls me a baby/tells me to man/grow up when I express that I'm hurt she cheated on me and that I have no right to be upset because I cheated over a year ago and it's okay because she was drunk; her clothes start smelling like men's cologne or cigarette smoke rather than her perfume; and she has begun deleting all of her texts, calls, FB messages, and pictures; and she has started lying to me about a lot. She also doesn't even pay attention to me, i.e. I told her 6 times when my last final was and the day of, after I had taken it, she asked when my finals were going to be done; and many times while I'm talking to her she'll be texting/FB/etc and just saying ""uh huh"", obviously not listening. Lastly, no affection for me at all, barely even pecks my cheek anymore.

Am I being strung along? I feel like a dumbass for just believing her when she says she still loves and wants to be with me.. But I also feel like a dumbass for doubting it.

83508,Dating,24asw9,"Started hanging out with a girl I've known for awhile recently. I asked her if she wanted to get coffee/something to eat and she said she was down. 


First time we met for lunch and had pizza and it was cool, it was pretty awkward at first but were both awkward people. This was my first time in a long time going out to meet someone I wasn't too familiar with. 


5 or 6 days later we hung out again but it was for lunch + drinks + dinner. We hung out for the whole day and had deep talks about relationships, life, existence and all that jazz. It's been awhile since I've been able to have conversations with such substance. I realized that I was starting to maybe catch feelings. It was fun, a good mix of laughs and seriousness. She is very similar to me with how we view the world and we both have had similar issues growing up. 


From this point I don't know whether to pursue it as something more. The first time we hung out it was the intention of just getting to know someone better and making friends because I felt like I've been neglecting some friendships the past few years. But now after this 2nd  time hanging out (Which I would consider a date) I am starting to build feelings for this girl. 


We are going to hangout this friday/weekend. Should I see how that goes and maybe hint that I am interested in her?

19730,Breakups,2q8n1a,"Myself and my now ex had met this time last year. We texted quite a lot, but school got in the way for me (at the time we went to different schools). She is very sweet, but the moment we met I was informed to not even try due to her very strict parents. I wasn't really put off by that as I've been told I'm good with respect and parents.

So Summer rolled around, we have barely texted since January, and I had decided I was transferring to the school she attended (she didn't play a role in the decision. The whole situation is another story). At this point, I was pretty happy. But I realized I should text her to catch up and set things right before the year started. 

That's when things started to escalate. We started texting everyday, and feelings started to grow. School started, and we would talk in the halls when we could, and after school. It wasn't until a dance (not formal) where I finally decided it's time to make it official. She agreed, and things started from there. Keep in mind, she's made me as happy as I've ever been. I had a close friend tell me she's never seen me this happy. 

Then the next night rolled around. She was at a party that I wasn't, and a guy we'll call Mike was also there. This kid was flirting with *all* the girls, and then got to mine. She didn't know how to reject him, and it turned to him pulling her and kissing her. What she's told me, it was 2-3 seconds and then her getting out of shock and pushing him away. 

I was informed by a friend, and told her to tell my ex to call me when she can. She called me, I demanded an explanation and she explained things. This is the part where I messed up. I told her it has only been a day, and that she'll have to earn my complete trust back. I wasn't too strict on that.  

We decided to see a movie and talk things in person (while waiting, and not be those people talking during it). We got things over, and enjoyed the movie. I didn't know she lied to her parents and said it was with a friend, the topic never came up. This is important, because her parents found on that night and got a little angry. 

I wrote a letter to her parents, offering to talk the situation and I apologized for anything I did that effected their rules. This did absolutely nothing. They now have a totally negative opinion of me, without ever meeting me, and I have no way of setting it right. They got her older sister to watch me and make sure I don't talk to the girl. This got my ex very scared, which made her scared to talk to me. We were forced to have (barely) any moments of talking, and eventually it only turned to smiles at each other in the hallways. 

I received a letter about 3 weeks ago. 2 pages long. It described how much I meant to her. And she said sorry, but I think it'd be best for you to move on. This devastated me, because she made me so happy. A smile from her made my day. I knew it'd be hard and I was at a very low point. 

As weeks would pass, a mutual friend would tell me about what she's doing, how she's been handling it. My ex was not handling it well. Nights of crying, all that great stuff. Her friends, my friends that know her kept telling her it's obvious she doesn't want to move on, so why keep the choice? For me, I obviously still like her very much. But she has completely shunned me. Looks away, is too scared to do anything. It's shattered my confidence in that people appreciate me. I was lied to. She's left me completely in the dark, and seems to not care.

Today, I come to you for help. Every night turns into tears. Every week I have a dream with her. It's taking its toll, and I don't know how to get up. The moment I get happy for a long time, it goes away. My close friend suggests I see a counselor, or seek professional help because she knows I've never been happy for a long period of time until I met her (her opinion of the situation is: she's being a bitch, if that puts any more insight). And now I've been thinking of doing things to try and stop the pain. But I get closer to finally doing it each time.

73088,Breakups,30pwqk,"I have recently come out of a relationship with somebody who I consider to be more important to me than anybody else.

However I completely understand her reasoning for ending the relationship. In the past I was emotionally abusive towards her and hurt her quite a lot. This in turn hurt me because I could see what I was doing to her and I made big steps in a renewed effort to put right my wrongdoings. We got back together after a breakup and things seemed to be *really* good.

Since May of last year I started to grow more distant and stopped being quite so emotionally available, happy, engaging, and passionate about the relationship. It became more and more of an effort because we weren't getting any real time away from each other. I do not much else but work in a job I don't like. So does she. We lived far enough away that we could see each other on weekends but spent pretty much every night talking on Facebook, something I found to be quite draining and selfishly didn't always make the most of because I wanted to do something else. Looking back in retrospect I realise how much she means to me but also that I hurt her just as much by becoming disconnected as when I was emotionally abusive to her.

It is a sobering reality to realise that for some reason you have not been the best version of yourself. She can do a lot better than the version of me that she had as well as the relationship we had at the end.

At the beginning things were great. But something keeps holding me back from maintaining my vulnerability and intimacy. I keep fighting the grass is always greener syndrome knowing that what I have is good (though sometimes losing sight of that) but my difficulties with talking about how I am feeling or opening up is something that can quite exhausting to me.

As much as it pains me to admit it, the relationship we had is over. It is for the better. She has a chance of being happy with somebody else and envy aside I sincerely hope that she can find it. 

I am lost at the moment. For a number of reasons including a near fatal motorcycle accident at the end of last year I have lost sight of who I am. I'm not getting any younger and I feel like the clock is ticking in terms of figuring out who I really am, where I am going wrong and what I can do to put it right.

Can anybody help offer some insight? I am an aggressive overthinker so other perspectives are good. I am seeking CBT therapy next week possibly with a course of anti-depressants to level things out before I go digging around but would very much value any opinions or help

114526,Relationships,2g1lfg,"My girlfriend and I have been together for over 6 years.  We've lived together for about 4 of those years.  Here's a brief history of our relationship just for some background:

* We both lived with our parents when we met.  I was in college, and she was just finishing high school.  Her parents were divorced and each remarried.  They sort of made her feel like it was the other parent's responsibility to care of her, and she felt guilty asking for anything from either of them.
* After a couple years of dating, we got an apartment together.  I was still in college, and she was working 2 part time jobs.  Things started great, but she had trouble keeping up with her half of the bills and housework.
* I graduated and things got easier financially as I got a job and started working.  She was still working part time.
* I encouraged her to go back to school.  She applied and got in, and really felt a sense of accomplishment.
* Going back to school was tough for her, as she wasn't a great student in high school.
* I told her to focus on school, and I would support us financially.  I was also left doing most of the household chores because she was too busy with school.
* We saved up enough money for a down payment, and bought a house.  All the financials are in my name, and I still pay all the bills except her car payment.
* She works part time, but still struggles to make her car payments on time.

I am a pretty independent person, and I feel like she has become more and more dependent on me over the years.  I had the hope that she will graduate and get a good paying job, and things will get better.  She is passing all of her classes, but hasn't looked for any internships and doesn't have a clear idea of what she wants to do after graduation.  She says she wants to work in an office.

I think I've let things go, and made excuses for her and tried to be strong and help her out for our entire relationship.  But I feel like that has all taken a toll on me over the years and I've sort of lost my own personality and identity.  Now my life constantly revolves around her.

She treats me well, and is appreciative of everything that I do for her, so it's not like she is a bad person.  I don't despise or resent her in any way, but at times I feel like I would be better off or happier on my own.  Or I daydream about being with someone who can contribute equally to the relationship, housework, and finances.

On the sexual side of things, the bedroom has been pretty stale.  She no longer initiates sex, and it feels a lot like another chore we have to do.  I've told her that the lack of sex makes me feel undesirable.  She says that it doesn't have anything to do with me.  She is so busy that sex is the last thing on her mind, or she doesn't feel sexy/confident in herself which makes it hard.  I feel like I have to beg for sex, and it makes me feel pathetic.  Again, I daydream about having a partner that wants me as much as I want them.

There are a lot of times when I feel like ending the relationship but I'm always left second guessing myself.  I try to convince myself that things will get better after she graduates.  I also feel guilty if I think about breaking up or asking her to move out.  I did say that I would aupport us so she could concentrate on school.  But when I look back, I was the one supporting us back when I was in school.  I just don't feel like things are fair in our relationship.

I haven't really talked to her much about these feelings.  I don't really know how to bring it up.  So I just bury the feeling and go on with my day, but it is starting to take a toll on me.  I don't know if I should just end things and not worry about what she has to do or where she end up, or if we can make things better, or if I should suggest we go to counseling.  Like I said, I just feel trapped.

We are each other's first love and it was not all bad but we fought a lot and broke up a few times. I caught her lying to me more times than I could count but somehow we stayed together through it all. Then over winter break we got into a gigantic fight and she broke up with me and said it was over for good. 

It was at this point that I realized I needed to see a therapist because I was not strong enough to get better on my own. I expressed this to her and showed her that I would do anything in the world to be with her. I have begun seeing a therapist and told her about it. We met up and talked to each other a lot and talked through a lot and I treated her like an angel for a whole week. We got back together and then the next day I came over and she dumped me again. Earlier that night I asked to use her phone to check something and I saw messages that were open with her friend saying she got asked on a date by a coworker. I didn't say anything about it until after she ended us.

She claims that this guy is not the reason that she ended it. She says that she still wants to be with me but I don't know how to believe that. All indications seem to be that she will be going on this date on wednesday. I don't know if I can be with her anymore after she goes on the date. I don't know what to do; whether I should hang on to the hope that we can be together again eventually, which is what she is saying is true, or whether I should move on. I need her so badly and I feel like what we have is very real but I have just gotten away from the way I needed to treat her. I don't want to give up but I don't know what is best for me to do while I wait for her. She says she needs space and time to forgive me but the date thing puts so much doubt in my mind.

BACKGROUND: We met when I was a customer at her mom's salon and would chat with her briefly during every visit for a haircut over a period of 2 years. I asked her out once before, but she was in an LTR that she ended, due to him being too dependent and controlling over her. I asked her out later and we eventually started dating and then made it official after about a month. Been together for 11 months now.

----------------------------------------------------------

Ever since I've known her, I've known she was on a student visa and she had planned on going back to her country if she wasn't able to get a green card after completing an excessive amount of schooling that would take years and a lot of money.


We've been pretty much inseparable since we started dating and her family loves me and mine loves her and things have been amazing and still are.


She recently brought up the fact that her visa will expire in a few years after she finishes her degree, but she wants to stay here with me and that she was hoping we could marry and this is where I feel pretty torn.


I'm head over heels for this girl, but 11 months just feels too soon to consider marriage. I expressed that to her and she said she understood. She mentioned that her mom pitched the idea of them paying someone to marry her and have a living arrangement to get her citizenship and they would divorce afterwards.


She mentioned that, even though it's an option, she doesn't want to marry and live with a stranger, which I understand, but I don't want to impulsively do something like this so soon.


She said she wants to find a way and she's been super stressed about it, but I was hoping we could continue dating while her student visa is still valid for a few years. She likes that idea, but she's really scared of the uncertainty and stress that comes with not being sure if she'll be able to stay here.


The whole situation is complicated and I just don't know what to think or do.

My dad has become increasingly angry, confrontational and downright mean to my mom, and lately my sister and myself.

Typically, my dad will come home from work at 4pm, crack open a beer, and start relaxing; the last beer usually ending at 9 before he goes to bed around 11.  I don't see it as that many, as they're just watered down domestic beers, and he has maybe 4 over the course of the night.  He never gets drunk, and has never had any issues with alcohol.

My mom will come home from work, start talking about her day and asking him about his, and he rarely shares much. He doesn't like to bring work home with him.  Lately, it seems like my mom can't say anything without him yelling at her, criticizing her, or putting her down some way.  He's never happy about anything, unless it's baseball/football or a bad B movie he's watched a million times.  He makes my mom feel so bad and she cries often. 

My mom tries to engage him in something fun, like a night out with their close friends, planning a vacation, or even just to watch a movie, and he wants nothing to do with that.  He hates to go out and hang out with their friends and openly complains about it to anyone who will listen. 

On a couple occasions, I'll be having a conversation with him, and he'll be perfectly normal with me, and then suddenly, it's as if I offended him.  He'll immediately raise his voice, talk over me and down to me, and I never know what I've done to upset him.  Just last week, my younger sister was talking about how hard it's been looking for a job post college, and he flipped on her! Completely lost it, started screaming, yelling that she had an attitude and was entitled.  He threw the frying pan he was drying onto the floor and just sulked away. 

I wonder if he's suffering from some form of depression.  I thought he was worried about is job, since he was temp-to-hire and his union rep hadn't contacted him regarding his employment status.  But that has since changed and he is now directly hired.  My grandparents, his in-laws, and his siblings are very worried about his behavior.  My mother says he's becoming his father, who had an absolute unbearable temper.  My dad did not have a good relationship with his dad, and has since lost him in 2009.

My parents do not have any financial issues.  Their house is paid off, they are about 10 years from retirement, and overall they are in good health.  I'm really afraid he's suffering with something, and he won't talk to us about it.  I don't think it's an affair- he never uses his cellphone, he never goes out or stays out late or does anything suspicious.

Jumping backwards to high school with them dating: Shelby seemed to be a nice girl. I didn't really meet her until junior year, a few months before her and Brett began dating, but Lisa knew her. They had lived down the street from each other as kids, but their mom's hated each other so they never hung out. Shelby also didn't seem to like my girlfriend very much, anyway. Lisa never talked bad about Shelby to me, but mentioned a few times that Shelby never seemed to enjoy her company, but I thought she was just over thinking it. Shelby seemed really nice and then when they began dating, it became an issue.

Lisa and I had already been dating a year previously before they began dating so we knew how a new relationship went. They wanted lots of alone time and we got that and didn't ask Brett to hang out too much. After about four months together, Lisa and I began calling Brett, asking if him and Shelby wanted to get a bite to eat with us or go see a movie and we would always hear Shelby trying to quietly say in the background, let's go without them, to which Brett would lie and say they already ate or they had seen that movie. Lisa and I were confused, but chose to ignore it.

So, the end of junior year came, and we threw a little get together at my house to celebrate. There was some alcohol, nothing too crazy. Brett shows up without Shelby, which we thought was weird because literally our whole friend group was beginning to think they were conjoined at the hip. So Lisa asks where Shelby is and Brett outright says that she doesn't like any of us. We ask if he was going to fix that and he tells us that she doesn't have to like us and we don't care. He stays at the party awkwardly for like an hour or two, doesn't have anything to drink because underaged drinking is wrong. And when he leaves, we are all fucking stunned. Since dating Shelby he completely changed. He used to drink with us all the time, smoke weed, what have you, but now that he was with Mrs. Goody-Two-Shoe, all of that had changed.

So, jump to when we are 20, right before Shelby and Brett broke up. Lisa and I are looking for apartments. We are still in contact with Brett, occasional calls, he hangs out with us from time to time when he's not sitting at home by the phone, waiting for it to ring with a call from Shelby, who is over 4,000 miles away. Brett calls Lisa and I and asks if there's an extra room in an apartment we are looking at. He is moving out of his parents and wanted to live with us. He has a steady job he enjoys and we think this is our chance to reconnect with our friend who was beginning to become lost to us, so we accept. I think it was four months later, Shelby called Brett and broke it off.

So, fast forward to August 2012, Brett gets a call from an unknown number. He answers it and it's Shelby, telling him she is back living in our hometown and wanted to meet up and talk. He was shocked to see her calling, seeing as after their break up, they stopped cold turkey with contact. After she called and dumped him, there was literally silence between them and the silence went on for nearly 7 years. At this point, Brett is already in a relationship with another girl named Christy, that is very sweet. I tell Brett not to get involved with Shelby again, to just text her and cancel plans he blindly made over the phone from shock with her. He claims it's just lunch to catch up. He wanted to hear about the job she should have landed by then and ask about life and her family. I told Lisa and while she was concerned, she said it wasn't our business. So, Brett goes to lunch with her, comes home claiming he loves her again and he's calling Christy to break up. Lisa was at work at the psychology firm she worked at after graduating college, so it was up to me to stop him. He did it, though. And then called Shelby and they got back together. 

After that, Brett went all distant from us again, stopped participating in drinking because it was bad for your brain cells or whatever. He would always be in his room on his laptop and when Shelby came over, she never said hi to Lisa and I, they went straight to Brett's room, locked the door, and that was that. Well, Lisa got irritated of this cycle after a few months of them being back together and confronted Brett and asked him if he was seriously going to let Shelby continue to hate his best friends that allowed him to move in to their apartment with them. Brett said it was Shelby's right to dislike us and Lisa was bewildered and told him that if he was going to take Shelby's side, then they could just move in together. Brett proposed the idea to Shelby, who immediately shot it down and claimed she liked living alone for the time being. And the cycle continued.

Now, in December 2013, Brett proposed to Shelby and she shot him down. It was embarrassing, too. In front of all of our friends at our holiday party that Shelby begrudgingly went to. Lisa and I were certain that this would cause them to break up, but they didn't. So on New Years Eve, Shelby comes to hang out at our apartment while we await the new year. Lisa and I do shots and drink together, laughing and having a really great time together. Shelby and Brett just sit on the couch watching TV, barely speaking to each other. Shelby looks beyond pissed and Brett looks bored. Lisa invites them to do a few shots to spice up the evening and Shelby goes off on Lisa, claiming she's not some moronic whore. I won't stand by and let her go off on my girlfriend, so I stand up for her and tell Shelby she is a bitch who has always hated us and that I didn't know why she was even still with Brett because it was clear she didn't even love him. How could she? In the years they have dated she refuses blow jobs because they're disgusting and won't have sex because she thinks it's a gross human act. She doesn't go out of her way for Brett even though Brett will and she's a bitch that thinks it's okay to talk to the love of my life in a condescending tone simply because she does more.

Shelby leaves and Brett yells at us for yelling at Shelby and then locks himself in his room. Lisa says to forget it and breaks out more alcohol, we have fun until New Years while we listen to Brett try to smooth things out on the phone with Shelby. So, on January 6th, Lisa calls me to her laptop to show me the rude messages Shelby is sending her, calling her a whore for having pre martial sex, taking birth control, and for choosing psychology/sociology as her career instead of the medical branch such as little RN Shelby. We show them to Brett, he says it's her right to say this. At the point, I am fed up.

I blow up on Brett and tell him the apartment is in my name and that I have a right to kick him out and that's what I'm doing. He will pay this cycles bills and be out by February 10th. I tell him that if he and Shelby are so much better than Lisa and I, then he should move in with her.

It's been over a week now, no confirmation on whether Shelby is going to let Brett move in, but at this point I don't care. He has some things in boxes already that I brought home from my job for him. He has tried talking to him, but I let him know he has crossed the line, betrayed us, and disrespected us and that we were no longer friends if Shelby was going to run his life. And he still *defended* her. I told him that by the time the move out date arrived and Shelby still hadn't confirmed whether he could move in with her, that it still wouldn't affect the date and that he would be leaving. I told him I'd personally drive him to his parents (over two hours away, now) because he wasn't allowed to live with Lisa and I anymore. Lisa's so relieved, she is already bringing home things to put in our now extra gaming room we are putting together and Brett gets to watch all of this.

Shelby still comes over and hangs out with Brett, but still hasn't given a confirmation of living arrangements. Have I handled this properly or am I an asshole? Should I try reconciling with Brett after he moves out?

*issue*

We have a strong relationship as we share common ideas of what married life and relationships should be. We also get along well since we share the same religion, ideas about children, education level, and so forth. The issue is that even though he is currently sober, no drugs including alcohol, and has only done shisha (arabic tobacco pipe) when living over seas I am concerned he may use drugs in the future for his family uses them. 

My parents died of OD and my uncle also was a hardcore addict till their death, kinda woke uncle up. I have gone to AA, NA and other meetings as a kid because of this. Our religion also forbids any alcohols or drugs, so even in times of weakness I fall back on the faith. I also was born addicted to cocaine cause of my mother, so always worried my addiction if I used coke would be worse. Thank god I've only drank alcohol a bit in college though. His family uses light drugs and it's only the siblings. At any rate he is completely desensitized to it because they seem ok doing it. He doesn't get how drugs don't always lead to normal functioning people like I do.

I am worried he may use drugs in the future because of this, peer pressure if you will. He use to not be ok saying he dislikes things that impair his mind, but as of late that viewpoint has changed because of his siblings. His siblings are one of his few friends, so that's another concern... 

Anyway, this worries me a lot. Add in the fact I DO NOT want drugs used or stored or brought into our home by his siblings. I am a teacher, so it would screw me up job wise plus morally and emotionally it disgust me as well as the fact the drug is illegal ugh.... 

He told me he doubts he'd ever use it and I told him point blank it's a deal breaker for me. I will work through anything from cheating to gambling or idk.. whatever else bad spouses do but I will NOT give a fuck if he does drugs. I will leave. OK.. I'll probly take him to his parents cause I care for him and wouldn't want him alone.. but then I will leave. Divorce. End of story.

I would finish out my lease in November and go back south temporarily, probably living with my parents while i decided which new city to move to and explore next, probably Austin.

However, I do not plan on staying in Chicago &lt;i&gt;too&lt;/i&gt; much longer. I want to make my move to Austin by next summer. She says she would go with me as long as she could finish nursing school there. 

This is potential new relationship is exciting for me, but also overwhelming. Like I said, i really like this girl alot. We mesh relly well together and I really do think we would be an awesome couple.

When we had first meeting he said since he is in financially bad situation and is paying for both him and his gf he will pay only a little more amount as rent for his gf to move in.

Than his gf comes out and says that they will pay nothing for her rent.

This weekend we were away at the beach and had a great time. On the Saturday afternoon his phone rang, and like I always do I passed it to him. It was a non saved mobile number and when I handed it to him it stopped ringing. It left a voice mail which he went up to listen to. He played the message out loud as it was a pocket call and we were trying to work out who it could be. He went to text it and the number was gone, it wasn't in the call record. Weird, but we talked about it and I let it go. 

Fast forward to Sunday night, we're home and sat watching TV and I was looking for something on his phone, can't even remember what now, when I saw a message in the text list from Saturday lunchtime from Facebook user (it's a windows phone and puts all messages into one list). It's just said 'hi how are you'. I asked him who it was (we're very open with phones and stuff like that) and he said he had no idea and that I could go to Facebook and look. I was curious so I did, and it was a girl neither of us know. I asked again if he knew her and he said no and to ask her who she was. I sent a message in reply to the one she had sent just asking who she was and she replied straight away saying she was from a dating site, and had his Facebook from a message he sent her from November when he went to look at her profile pictures. 

Now at this point I felt physically sick... I never ever ever thought he would do something like that. I replied to her again asking what dating site and she said she couldn't remember and that she would stop texting if I wanted (she still though she was talking to my bf). All for this time he is swearing blind that he doesn't know what she is and is getting angry as I'm near hysterical and upset. I asked to look at his email for dating sites and he agreed. 

Now a this point I need to fill you in on some backstory. He has a very abusive ex. She was controlling and a general nightmare. She verbally abused women off his Facebook to the point a police report was filed. Now when we got together he told me she set him up a load of dating profiles when they split up and about a month into our relationship we closed down one together, I think it was zoosk or okcupid. The account looked completely unused, so I believed him, I had no reason not to. 

Now Sunday night he logged onto his Hotmail and let me look for dating profiles. I found plenty of fish and match. Match had not sent an email since may but the old 'please subscribe' emails were there. And plenty of fish had one 'someone wants to talk to you' in the deleted folder and some 'reminder to check your account' from months ago. At this point I really am near melt down and he is really angry that I'm so upset. He kept asking who I was and why was I acting like that?? He said that he never visited them and that I should believe him.  He also said that I should give him some credit as the woman from Facebook was ugly and why would he want to message her? He said that I could log onto the accounts and look for myself. I logged in from the emails and had to change the password for one, but the other was the password that he uses for all low level stuff. Now he said that his ex knew that password and thats why it was that. Now I looked through both profiles, they had all his likes on it and a simple 'just ask me if you have any questions' tag line. Now I didn't bother asking about that as I knew he'd just say he was with the ex for 10 years and she knew his likes. I looked through the rest of the profile and there were no messages anywhere in the inbox or deleted folders and nothing in the people you've worked at box or anything. It was completely blank. 

He promised me that he hadn't been using them. I asked why he had never shut them down and he said that he never set them up, why should he bother to shut them down, it just going with the rest of the junk mail. He swore blind that he never used them and that he was always with me, which is true he never has time to use them. I honestly don't believe he's been using them. I'm not wholly convinced he never set them up, but I've told him in the past that I couldnt care less if he used them before we met, but he always swore he didn't and he had no reason to lie. 

We went to bed that night agreeing to talk about it again tomorrow and try to move on from it. He came home Monday night and I asked him to promise me again that he hadn't been using the profiles, which he did. I also asked if that woman had replied yet, as she stopped when he asked if he could have a screen shot of the messages and if she knew his ex. He said she hadn't. But it was enough for him to get mad about me dragging it out and that I was just going on and on... And we argued again. I told him that I could let the profiles go, but that I needed to know who that woman was. He told me to message her, so I did. I apologised to her for asking, but that I wanted to know ow she knew him and when they were talking. She hasn't replied to me as yet. We worked it out that night and I promised to try to get past it, and he promised with everything he had that I had nothing to worry about. 

I've felt shit all day, I keep flipping between believing him because this really is something that his ex would do (they have two children together and are going through a bitter court case for visitation rights) and he really is an honest, open and straightforward guy, and then questioning everything because if this was a friend and all I knew was why I've told you guys, I'd be telling them he was probably lying! 

I feel like I'm going crazy. I asked one more time tonight if I could message her from his phone as my message with have gone into her other outbox and she hadn't read it. He got angry again and said 'here you go again, dragging it on and on!', told me to use his phone but to be quick about it as he needed to use it to 'ring his kids that he won't be allowed to speak to' as his ex has cut contact again. He said that I'm over reacting and that he doesn't understand why I need to know who this woman is. I got angry and sad that 99% of woman would be convinced he was cheating and that at least I was trying to deal with it and trusted him. He said that  was wrong and the most women wouldn't think that at all and it was just me...

He told me that he did not want to be in my life and he did not want me in his because he is too scared he wont focus 100% on school. He said he felt he was holding me back. I was devastated, especially since I thought he was committed to me, and I saw a future with him and having a family with him. I told him that. Pretty severe.

 Now I struggle to cope with this breakup. I cant stop thinking about him during the day - all kinds of thoughts good/bad. I get angry one moment, that he told me he had to devote himself to studying 100% and then a week later I coincidentally saw him leaving a popular bar in the middle of the day...he saw me too. I know its none of my business anymore what he does, and I shouldnt care to devote much thought to someone who tells me that he does not have time for me and does not want me in his life, but he is always in my mind. Almost every night I have dreams with him in them - they wake me up. Even mundane dreams he sneaks into. None of this prevents me from doing what I have to on the daily for work, family, friends, etc. Still wake up on time, take care of myself properly. I still move forward - but I feel like I am moving forward and he is still in the back of my head creeping around like a shadow. Kind of haunting me and I just want him out of there. I am not sure if that makes sense, but if someone can relate or give me some advice that could help me I would appreciate it.

Im wondering if anyone has some advice for me, or has been through this before. Its been 4 weeks and I think I should have digested all this by now and be able to have just myself in my mind.

I miss him and it's been really hard, I've literally been on the verge of tears 24/7.



Friday night I went out with some of my girlfriends. There was an event upstairs at the bar we work at and we decided to go, and afterwards when we came downstairs this cute guy who I had seen around a few times (he lives across the street) was there sitting at the bar. I was sitting with my girlfriends for like 30 min before he came up to me and asked to buy me a drink. I said ""sure"" and we started talking. He was actually really good conversation, and when he asked if I wanted to come over to his place I said yes. I ended up having a lot of fun with him but I thought that was that because although I gave him my number, I didn't hear from him for like four days so I figured it was a one-night stand kind of thing. 


He (Jackson) ended up texting me on Tuesday asking if I wanted to hang out again and I did, and we hung out last night too. I'm really surprised that we went from not knowing each other at all to hitting it off so well, but we have the same sense of humor, lots of things in common, he's really interesting, and we seem to want the same things out of life. I like hanging out with him a lot but part of me is scared to continue because I'm obviously still in love with Dylan, although I know we can't be together. I'm definitely not over him and I'm worried I'm using Jackson as kind of a ""place-holder"" for Dylan and I'm scared that I'm not ready and haven't spent enough time being single and I'm really really rushing things, but I don't know how to bring this up to Jackson without being totally awkward. I tend to play things close to the vest and I'm nervous to bring up Dylan because I feel like it's too soon to talk about previous boyfriends. It really really sucks because I could totally see myself being with Jackson, and I like spending time with him now, but I don't know if it's wrong. Is it wrong? Should I stop seeing him? It doesn't help that I met Dylan when I was only 18, I don't really know how ""grown-up"" dating works... Last time I went on a ""date"" I was a junior in high school...

1828,Dating,3bu4i2,"Hi, all. I'm a 37 year old art studio art professor at a relatively large private university. Back in the fall of 2014, I found out that my wife was having an affair with one of her coworkers. We honestly tried to work it out for a couple months, but she ultimately left me for the other guy. I was reeling. I had been dating my wife since I was 19, and we got married when I was 25. After 18 years being in love with her and wanting to spend my whole life with her, I was just devastated. One of my students, Daniel, was doing a supervised internship with me that fall semester when I was going through all this. I was struggling at hiding my stress from him, and I trusted him a lot since it was his third year with me. I told him the minimum, that I was going through a divorce. 

In January, the Spring 2015 semester started, and I was teaching 3 different classes, plus a supervised internship again. One of my classes was an upper division class that required department acceptance to get into, meaning, all of my students were incredibly talented. Most of them were seniors graduating that semester, but there was one girl who was only 19, a sophomore. She was quite precocious and took a definite liking to me. I kind of interpreted it as just her wanting to get a recommendation from me/get some good tips from me, since I am pretty respected in the department and have pretty good connections in some museums I knew she was interested in working in. We were talking in my office one day when she drops the bomb and asks me how I was feeling. I was confused and pressed her to why she was asking. Turns out, Daniel had some loose lips and let it slip that I was going through a divorce. I was slightly uncomfortable answering, but I was still at a moderately teary point in the coping process, so I was predictably slightly emotional answering her even though I was trying to remain professional. She ended up giving me a hug, and that was that. A few weeks after that, I felt awkward around her and very embarrassed in class, but she acted like that exchange never even happened. As the semester went on, and I don't know why this happened, but I began looking at her in a different way. I would notice how soft her hair looked or how a dress she wore hug the curves of her body so perfectly. I felt like a scum bag, honestly. I tried to shake those feelings all the time, but I think after that original hug she gave me, I think she took that as her breaking the physical barrier between us. I began flirting with her a bit, and she reciprocated. Soon after that, she asked me out to have coffee with her on the weekend once. I should've said no, I know it, but I went with her anyway. We talked in that shop for three hours about anything that was unacceptable for us to talk about. I talked about my ex-wife and what her leaving me did to my psyche, my self-esteem. I made a remark somewhere that I couldn't even believe that she (my student) could even think an old fart like me was attractive. Flash to later that night when I went back to her apartment and drank some wine with her. She ended up kissing me on the couch and we had sex shortly after. 

Honestly, the couple months following that were great. Unacceptable. Unprofessional. Bad for me. But they felt so good as they were happening. She showed me this sort of raw attraction and dedication to me that my ex-wife had been withholding from me. Of course she's beautiful; she just turned 20. She's young, fresh, and has opened me up to thoughts I didn't think I possessed. 

However. The big however. After looking into my university's policies-after the fact, of course, I'm a fucking idiot-I found out that our relationship is completely against school policies and could get me fired. I want to end it now. I don't want to lose my job, but I'm afraid of what she'll do if I end it. I'm afraid she's become quite enamored with me now. She hasn't said that she loved me, but I think if I prompted her, she might. I'm her sexual fantasy that she finally achieved. I'm still incredibly attracted to her and want to continue to have sex with her, buy her things that she wants, take her out to dinner, and cook meals for her. I love the dynamic we have now. It's extremely satisfying to me. I just can't go on risking someone in the department finding out. But maybe it's already too late for that? 

I'm afraid what will happen if I ask to end things. Her personality is quite...assertive, to put it kindly. She didn't get to where she is in her life at such a young age by being a pushover or not working hard. She's meticulous. She's forceful. She has a hunger. She's everything wild and insaitiable a 20 year old is. But she's also unpredictable and sometimes disturbed, haunted by her own past of sexual abuse. I found this out recently. She suffers from some bouts of manic depression, but she takes meds to regulate herself. I'm just afraid of the situation I've put myself in now. I don't know if it's possible for me to cut things off evenly and perfectly if she decides to take my life down as revenge. 

Everything is so complicated and shitty. I want to blame her for being so intoxicating and pursuing me. I want to blame my ex-wife for leaving me as the mess I was to be able to put myself into this position. I want to blame Daniel for telling her that I had gone through a divorce. I want to blame everyone but myself, but I know I'm the one responsible for all of the pain and suffering I'm sure I will endure. I was not myself coming out of my marriage. I was impulsive and not making good decisions in any aspect of my life (stopped eating, started abusing alcohol as I had once done, neglected regular bathing and exercise). 

I just don't know what to do now. Do I end things against both of our wills in hopes that this will just fizzle and I can retain my job? Do I stay with her and do what we both want, hoping that we can keep it a secret for longer? Do I end it and be proactive within my department and hope they have mercy on me? 



   
**tl;dr**: As a broken man after a divorce, I ended up sleeping with/having a relationship with one of my students that continues now.

Anyway I was out drinking with some friends and a girl that I vaguely know (friend of a friend) was all over me, following me around and generally trying to dance with me the whole night. This has happened to me a fair bit with this person but I have always been able to just ignore her, so its never been a problem before, but this time I was ridiculously drunk (no excuse) and she went all guns blazing.

Now I don't even remember this happening but my buddy who was there said that she leaned in and kissed me, seemingly out of nowhere, its a big leap considering I wasn't even touching her in any way beforehand. My friend also said that as soon as I knew what was happening I immediately walked away from the situation which was only a few seconds and in fact we (me and my friends) left the club to go home straight away within 30 seconds of all this happening. My friend brought it up today and since being told, I've felt physically ill. 

Anyway I don't know how I should tell my gf as we haven't even given ourselves that label (not fb official or anything like that) and even considered a somewhat 'open' thing which I personally don't want, but I am feeling terrible that this happened. I don't know whether she would even worry about it or if it would be a massive deal.

67670,Relationships,2qo9x9,"I (25/f) have been dating my boyfriend (24/m) officially for 5 months, unofficially for 6 months. In the beginning, our relationship was great. I was attracted to his sense of humor, his intelligence, maturity and warmth. But I have been struggling the past couple of months because my boyfriend has Seasonal Affective Disorder (winter blues, seasonal depression). I want to be supportive, but I find myself faltering.

So basically, around the end of October, my boyfriend told me about this tendency for a bad case of winter blues. He also told me that he at various points in his life, has been diagnosed with extremely mild forms of depression, anxiety and ADHD. He was at his lowest at age 20 when for about a month he couldn't even will himself to get out of bed.
We had a big discussion about this in early November and he confessed his fears that I would get tired of him and leave him, because his two ex girlfriends both broke up with him due to his negativity.

Since that conversation around 7 weeks ago, he became more withdrawn, exhausted, and irritable. If he doesn't use his sun lamp for a day or two, or if he goes to bed later than midnight, it affects him for days. It was such a gradual process that one day last week when he was having a good day, he made me laugh quite a bit and I realized I haven't seen this side of him in months. I am trying my best to supportive but it is tough because we have a young relationship. He has thanked me over and over for being supportive, but sometimes I have to bite my tongue not to scream. It's hard to be around someone who is moody and bitter much of the time. We planned a night of crazy, wild sex last night and he had trouble staying hard...it was tough. Usually we have amazing sex, so he was pretty embarassed at that.

I feel so selfish saying this. I care for him a lot and want him to be happy. There's so much about him I do like. He's caring, intelligent, worldy, and deep. I know it sounds awful but I keep thinking about my boyfriend of September and how I like him much more than my boyfriend of December. He even confessed to me last night that he doesn't know a time when he has truly been carefree and happy. I'm no expert but that doesn't seem good. I just keep telling myself to hang in there until March, and he will go back to his old self.

My question is this: has anyone ever dated/been with someone with SAD? How can I be supportive and understanding? Is there a way of also making sure my needs are being met?

TL;DR I am frustrated by my boyfriend's winter depression, despite trying to be selfless and understanding. Don't know what to do.

So about 3 months ago I set up online dating profile. For about a month and a half I got the typical ""want to have sex"" or the ""I live in moms basement and don't have a job but I am a nice guy"" messages from time to time and some messages from other guys who things just didn't work out. 


Then a month and a half ago my profile was ""viewed"" by a guy. I read his profile and it was almost like reading a well written comedy movie script. I didn't send him a message because to be honest I didn't think a guy almost foot and half taller and in way better shape would even reply.


But he sent me a message about something in my profile (he said he saw that I looked at his profile) and we talked a whole bunch for a while. Then for two weeks we didn't talk very much because the camp he works at is super remote (he did snapchat me some pictures and its super desolate and in the far north) and the cellphone reception only works in a tiny part of his camp and he can't bring his phone underground either and the internet wasn't working properly half the time he was there. 


Then for the two weeks he came back I went with my parents to a different province for most of the time he was back in the city. We texted a whole bunch, but then he went to work and I came back. The internet/cell reception was I guess fixed or whatever because we texted and talked a bunch (except during his work hours, twelve 12-14 hour shifts in a row).


Then when he last came back he asked if he could take me on a date. We did and it was pretty awesome. We went to a really nice (and pretty expensive) resturant and then went and played mini golf and then went for ice cream .


Then 4 days later he took me on another date. We went to a kinda nice bar that I like. We were there for about 3 1/2 hours (almost 4 hours) and he drank 3 double whiskey and waters (not sure how that would even taste good) in that time then just water for the rest of night. I probably drank a little too much, but it was fun and we saw some of my friends that talked with us for a while. He drove me home in his big truck and walked me to my house.


Then tonight we went out again and walked in a park in the old (but not ghetto) historical part of the city for quite a while (like hours).


When we got back to his truck and got inside and said ""I have to tell you something"". It was a pretty nice walk and stuff so honestly I wasn't expecting something like what he was going to say. Then he said ""I think your really pretty, funny, cool and I really like you and I want to ask you out, But. I need you to know something about me and if you tell me no, or to get lost after you know. I totally accept that and I won't be mad or anything"".


Then he told me he has a criminal record and spent 4 1/2 months inside a prison and 5 1/2 months at a halfway house. He told me what he did and I actually remember my dad reading about what he and two other guys did in the newspaper like 3 1/2 years ago. That was only time ever that I have heard my dad swear and he said EXACTLY this ""Holy shit that must have took some steel nuts, they better have good lawyers"". 


Whe he was driving me home (its not that far of a drive) he said ""Sorry if I dissapointed you, but I fly to work tomorrow and I won't have cellphone reception for 2-3 days anyways. So if you don't want to or don't feel comfortable going out with me, either just send a short text or just don't say anything at all and I will understand"". He walked me to my house and gave me a hug and left.


I don't want to post what he did because you can still find traces online of what he did (under his old name[s] before he legally changed them after he got out I guess) because I don't want to be identified on reddit or something. But what I will say is that he didn't like murder/hurt/rape someone or rob a old ladys purse, but it was pretty serious (the prosecutor wanted to put him and his partners in crime in jail for 8 years) but I guess they had good lawyers.


I am pretty confused on what to do. Like yeah he was 19 when that all happened, but he still went to jail and stuff. I know he must doing well for himself/responsible with money because I saw his credit card when we had dinner and its a world elite mastercard (I googled the requirements). He is a really nice guy and is funny and stuff mixed with mature. But I read a bunch of stuff about dating ex-cons and people talk about them reoffending and being shitty people. 


Like he doesn't look like a thug guy at all and doesn't have tattoos that you can see when he is wearing a t-shirt and the ones he does have are really small memorials for his two brothers and mom and a small motorhead one. But besides being 6'6 and pretty musclely he doesn't stand out in a crowd and he doesn't really swear. But the part of him being a former prisoner and the whole criminal record thing. I like him but I don't know what to do. Would people think badly? Would my family like disown me or something? Will someone always have a criminal mentality or something?? What do I say to him?

So I met her through Blendr, the dating app for phones. We messaged back and forth for a couple of months, being cutesy, and a bit lovey dovey. To be honest, I wasn't looking for a real relationship when I joined Blendr. When I talked to her, though, the words were sort of automatic. I'd send generic cutesy messages, and she'd love it. So we decided to meet up for NYE.

When I saw her, she was bigger than my tastes would allow for a relationship, but apparently not more than my tastes for just sex. She, on the other hand, was way into me. She was smitten. I invited her to my place a couple times, and had sex with her. I should not have done that, but what's done is done. I started growing distant, and then she suddenly stopped texting me. I didn't care, I was happy that she stopped.

That lasted about a week. I checked Blendr, and saw she had sent me two messages on there, first was five days prior to checking, and the second was two days prior. The first one was her telling me why she couldn't text. She said she was downloading music on her phone, and went over her memory limit, which forced the phone to reset and so she lost my number. She wanted me to contact. The second was her asking why I hadn't gotten back to her, and if she had done something wrong, she wanted me to let her know. I texted her, teliing her I thought she was mad at me, and I was sorry. Truth was, I wasn't, but I felt bad about leaving her hanging. So we were back to texting, but I wasn't doing it much. I would miss her texts by hours and then reply. (I know I'm an asshole.) I wasn't sending anymore cutesy messages. She noticed how distant I was and asked if there was something wrong. 

I told her I was sorry, but she shouldn't pursue a relationship with me, because I'm in a shitty position in life and she would be burdened with me. She said that it was all bullshit, and I used her to get sex. She told me later she wanted to punch me in the face for how I treated her, and why would I throw away the friendship? After she stopped ranting, I deleted her number and our text thread. I thought it was over. She hadn't contacted me in about 5 days.

My mom answered, and let her in. I was shocked and surprised to see her, noticeably. My mom even commented on it later. She brought with her a Valentine's gift bag, with chocolates, a teddy bear, and a big balloon. But there was also a note. She wrote a note saying (paraphrased) that she was sorry she said I was bullshitting her, and that she wanted to work on what we have if I'm willing to. When she arrived, she said she waited outside my front door for 10 minutes psyching up the courage to knock. She said she was happy to have done it, and I hugged her.

This is where I made a fatal flaw. Instead of laying it straight that we don't have a future together, I invited her to my bed. I had sex with her, and made sure it was really good. She looked at me with loving eyes after, and kissed me a lot. When she was leaving, I escorted her to her car, and she held my hand the whole way. She told me to text her and not ignore her. Then she left.

How do I now tell her? I can't look at her Valentine's gift. It's upsetting me. I shouldn't get to feel upset though. She went through all this to try to win me back, and I made it seem like it will, by having really good sex with her. What I'm afraid of most is breaking her heart, and being called an asshole, which I know I am. I don't want her to shed tears over me. I'm not worth the pain. But she wants me, and wants to work on what we have, and if we won't have a relationship, she wants to remain friends. But I know that won't be a good idea, as it will hurt her if I end up in a relationship with another woman. I feel like I painted myself into a corner. If I had just turned her away, she would hurt a little, but she'd get over it faster. Now, she's going to feel like I used her one more time for sex, and I really really didn't. But there's no way it doesn't look like I did. What do I do?

My friend (lets call him mike) has a 5 year old kid with his ex(we'll call her daisy, they broke up over a year ago.

I don't even know how all of it came to be. Daisy invited me to a BBQ with a bunch of friends 2-3 weeks ago, I went, trying to hook up with a friend of hers. After hanging out a couple times after that, we fooled around a few times. Then we ended up sleeping together the other day. It was horrible sex, I felt like a giant piece of shit the entire time and stopped halfway and just couldn't do it. I don't even drink, I was sober for all of this. Only thing I can blame it on is being emotionally vulnerable and lonely. 

I don't know why I did it. I think part of it was none of my friends were there for me when I needed them during the break up. They all blew me off, hung out with eachother(other buddies of mine) and excluded me. I felt betrayed and abandoned by all of them cause I didn't do pills/drink with them. 

Mike just got out of jail for a DUI related charge, he was in there for a week or so. Now that he's out, he's texting me again and trying to hang out. This is only because he's single now and just broke up with his current girlfriend. Now HE want's to be friends again. He's also asking why I'm talking to his ex, and what's going on. Why are we friends on snapchat etc..

Another problem, I actually feel something when I'm with this girl daisy. Maybe it's just because we've Known each other for like 6 years.  Or maybe cause we're not supposed to do this. But it's really exciting and new, it's helping with my breakup. She knows I don't want anything serious.

I don't know what to do, mike invited me over for poker tonight. daisy invited me over he place. She was at his house earlier today hanging out with mike and their kid. It's all so fuckin weird to me. She just doesn't care and apparently doesn't feel guilty.

13773,Relationships,328fnv,"Hi guys! This is my first ever post on Reddit, but I needed some objective advice.


So my boyfriend and I are long distance (2.5 hours) and have been dating for about 10.5 months now (together in the same city for 3, long distance for school for the rest). Things got serious pretty quickly, as I spent the night at his place almost every night the summer we were in the same city. His birthday was very soon after we started dating (like 2 weeks), but I got him lots of smaller gifts that I knew he liked.


So a little background on his behavior and why I am even asking this question...
He has the tendency to back out last minute of coming to see me or not going to things that are important to me. For example, the weekend we were supposed to visit my brother and SIL and he was going to meet them for the first time (this was back in the fall). My brother and I are close, and this weekend was important to me (which I told my boyfriend). 

My brother works for a corporation that throws a festival once a year for two months or so that is really fun, and my brother and SIL love to take people to it. So they asked us what dates worked for us to come (offering us first pick since they want to take their friends too). We choose a date, but end up having to change it due to work issues, which is fine. So we pick another date (a month in advance). 


Two days before, he says his parents want him to come to dinner on Saturday night of that weekend we had planned to spend with my brother (they live 45 min away from my brother). So now he wants to leave and go see his parents Saturday night/Sunday. Important to note is that we have spent two whole weekends together with his parents at this point, and the most time any of MY family has gotten was one dinner with my parents at a restaurant. This situation rubs me the wrong way, like we would be using my brother as a hotel and ticket for this event and then leaving after it was done. I said no, that's not fair to my brother and SIL who we had already cancelled on once and had planned this weekend for over a month. We had originally planned for me to drive over to his house and take one car down, but then he wanted to drive separately so he could leave when he wanted. I said no, that was rude and an insult to my family since they had planned this so far in advance for us and to spend time with/meet him. So he says fine, he's just going to stay at home all weekend instead of making a decision on what he's going to do. 


This is so hurtful to me, but I end up driving down and having a great weekend by myself with my brother. He ends up driving and spending the weekend with his parents. He said I had put too much pressure on him to come so he backed out because of that.


Flash forward a few months, and he has backed out of coming to see me several times last minute because he has anxiety about coming to my city (an ex GF went to school here so he 'has bad memories,' even though SHE LIVES IN THE SAME CITY HE DOES NOW). I'm let down and heart broken every time this happens, and I tell him this.


So we have a huge fight in January over a simple miscommunication (I was a little passive aggressive, but not even that much and I profusely apologized for it). He tells me he doesn't know if he wants to be with me anymore and that his feelings for me have changed. I am devastated and do everything I can to prove that I'm dedicated to the relationship. 


So my birthday is the day after Valentine's Day. This would be the first time in my life I would have a 'Valentine,' and I told my boyfriend that it meant a lot to me. He had the 16th of Feb. off from school while I didn't, so the plan was for him to come to me that weekend. I told him specifically that weekend meant a lot to me and was important.


So I ask him to see if he was still coming, and he blows up that I put so much pressure on him to come over to see me, and that if I just let him choose to do it instead of making it an obligation, he would come. But because I gave him no option and that I was making him come see me that weekend, he wasn't because there was too much pressure.


Well, that pissed me the fuck off royally. Yes, you as my boyfriend DO have an obligation to come see me on Vday AND my birthday, especially when I told you it meant a lot to me. He ends up texting me Happy Valentine's Day, and I tell him he could have at least CALLED me. So I'm expecting a call on my birthday the next day, and I get another text. I'm really hurt again by this. About a week or so passes, and we end up breaking up.


We end up reconciling because I do love him and it was hell for those few days not being with him. I do want to say that normally he is very caring and attentive to me, takes me out, pays for everything. But it just seems when I let him know something means a lot to me, he backs out last minute because it's too much pressure. I just don't know what I'm supposed to do though, because if I don't tell him, that's like playing mind games and hoping he can guess what I'm thinking. I'm trying to be up front with him.


So now for my actual question!! Once we got back together, I asked if we could celebrate Vday and my birthday the next time we saw each other because it did mean a lot to me. He said yes, of course. So three weeks ago, I went to see him. This was the first time we had seen each other since our breakup/fight. It was great, just like old times. No birthday/Vday celebration, until Saturday night at dinner where he told me he hadn't forgotten what I had said, he just didn't want to plan anything since it was our first time back together and we were still shaky at that point, which I can understand. 


So he is supposed to come see me next weekend. I haven't brought it up since that's what 'pressures' him, but I can't help but want/expect something. At this point, a card and a cupcake with some flowers is fine. Just SOMETHING to recognize the (what I think was a) perfectly reasonable request. I'm very nervous that he won't do anything though, and that I'll be let down again.


So basically, do I say anything to him about it? I don't want him backing out again last minute, but I know I should be direct with my expectations. I'm just not sure what I should do. Please help!!


   
**tl;dr**: Boyfriend missed actual birthday/Vday weekend because I put too much pressure on him to come. Told him I wanted to celebrate it when we saw each other next. Didn't do anything when we saw each other, but mentioned that he hadn't forgotten.

Yesterday, me and my now ex-partner decided it was best to end our relationship of 3 years and 3 months. Last september i decided to leave my full-time job to come to university about an hour away from our home town. Prior to this we thought about saving for a house, she unfortunately fell pregnant and we had an abortion as neither of us were ready for that, she also went through so medical issues which put strain on our relationship but we stuck by each other and have some great memories together. 

It was awful for us both to sit down and talk about it but we both said it wasn't fair on each other or ourselves to carry on living how we were with petty arguments and falling out over nothing. She is still working a job in our town which i constantly would persuade her to try and better herself and not to get content with it as it wasn't anything special, i recently realised this wasn't my place and i was perhaps putting too much pressure on her. She wants a house and a family, i want this but i want to see the world and have some fun first. Im going travelling in the summer and i even offered to pay for the whole trip if she were to come with me but she declined.

Basically we've both realised we want different things at different times in life, we both have so much love for each other but our views on life are so different. We want to be parts of each others life, and its so tough having to break up when neither of us want to, but we've tried over the past few months to make things work but in our current situations we just aren't compatible.

Could anybody offer some advice on dealing with this situation? We've said we will give it a week or so to settle down before we speak again.

128816,Breakups,234rrh,"Don't even know what to say, really. Odds are this is gonna end up being a rambling mess so I'm sorry in advance for that. 

Guess I'll start at last Fall. My ex and I had been together steadily for about a year and a half at that point and the new semester was rolling around. It came, everything was gravy for the most part, but her extra-curricular stuff (hard to explain, basically a spirit squad) started ramping up and that started throwing me off. The people she was involved with weren't really the type of people I got along with and she'd often ask me to tag along which didn't appeal to me much at all. It wasn't that they were bad people or anything, I just wasn't into it. She started off wondering why I never went to football games and stuff, and that snowballed into her accusing me of not being supportive. So that was new, but it wasn't a massive part of what ended up happening.

Biggest part though, was something happening to me. I've been dealing with depression/anxiety and a bitch of a panic disorder throughout high-school and as always seemed to happen around the Fall, it reared its ugly head. I ended up missing quite a few days (more than I'd like to admit, believe me) due to the fact that it was hard to just get out of bed in the morning, much less make it through hours at school. One of those days, she was planning on asking me to homecoming. Apparently she'd been up making posters the night before and it really took a toll on her to have it all be for nill. She (understandably) got upset about it, and started telling me how she worried about me and all, said she couldn't do it any more and we decided to take a break for a few weeks. Decided to try again, and we just fought more, which lead to her deciding to call things off.

Few weeks go by, and she calls me up to ask if we can talk. Tells me that on homecoming night (I ended up not going) she hooked up with someone she'd known for a while... We were done and broken off, but it still stung. 

To make matters worse, she told me that he called me abusive due to her talking with him about our sex life and how she was uncomfortable with it, something that was NEVER brought to my attention. We were fairly kinky, she liked moderate humiliation (name calling, etc), light face slapping and *very* light choking, if you could even call it that. I always made sure she was comfortable with everything, we had a safeword and I'd encourage her to use it if she became uncomfortable before things started, always made sure to give aftercare when things were done. The whole 9... She told me that she'd been talking about this with the person she hooked up with, telling him that she felt that I actually meant the things that I said/did and that I had a ""fire in my eyes"" during sessions/scenes. Looking back at this it seems like these were probably insecurities that should have been a hard limit, but my god hearing her say those that (let alone the accusations of abuse from a 3rd party) broke my fucking heart. Knowing that she had kept those thoughts from me for whatever reason was (and is) fucking terrible. Even though I have always thought of myself as a caring person, I started looking at myself as a monster and the whole thing brought on a massive amount of guilt. 

Going forward, we tried to remain friends, but it just didn't work out. We stopped talking for a while, and one day I texted her and she just said that she didn't want me to contact her. Just when it felt like I'd gotten myself together, I fell apart worse than before. I just gave up and lost hope. Became a hermit, diet and hygiene went to shit, school of course fell apart. Thankfully I've been able to patch things up for the most part, but that's beside the point.

That brings me to the present. I can't seem to shake this shit off. Everything else is coming together and I have every reason to be happy, but I can't stop searching for answers and it's breaking me in half. I don't want to get back together, lord knows that our relationship was flawed, but I just want closure and I don't know if I'm ever gonna get it. I haven't tried to contact her since she said not to, but I feel like I need to try to get the answers and clean up the mess that was left. Every time I come close to calling, fear of the unknown (what a joy GAD is) shuts that right down.

Thanks for the chance to vent. Even if no one reads everything, it helps a lot to have an outlet for all the things I've been feeling.

On our second round when I was going to put the condom, I missed the correct side and then flipped it over and put it on. Which means I touched the outside of condom with my penis which was likely wet with semen. I don't think she came, but I remember her pussy being unusually warm (indicating she was ovulating) and even though she did not cum she got really wet, there was like this goo on my crotch which I assume is her lubrication. I read up it was also a sign of her ovulating.

UPDATE 1:

We were talking tonight while having dinner and she said to me ""I havent had my period yet"", and then said started questioning me about the odds of her being pregnant. I had to keep it together saying how it would be impossible for her to be pregnant and how normal it is for women to get laid periods. By that moment she was shedding tears, and even though on the inside I was a hopeless 5 year old girl crying for help, I had to act out like it was nothing so she could confort herself. I'd like to thank all of your comments, because as you can see I'm going through this by myself completely, and it's really comforting to read you guys comments. But anyway, she decided to get a pregnancy test so tomorrow we will know for sure. Damn I lose my breath just to think of that test being positive, really wish I could just say I'm prepared to whatever comes, but the mere thought of having to deal with my girlfriend being pregnant makes me sick to my stomach. Anyway, thanks again for all your comments, they're being REALLY helpful. Will update tomorrow after the tests.

So, I recently began seeing my old high school sweetheart (lets call her Jenny (f,20)about two-three months ago and I've come to realize that she isn't what I wanted. We dated on and off for my latter two years of high school and it went sour the first autumn of college. We didn't speak for about 8 months until we reconciled our differences and agreed we could coexist as friends. We've made a great friendship ever since then up until April when we both accidentally slept together one night and afterwards both expressed feelings for each other and a willingness to have one more go at a relationship soon. Ever since we first broke up she's had an inconsistent living situation and was even legitimately homeless for the majority of 2012. She's since been living with friends and been working to put her life back together despite many setbacks. She's now looking towards me for hopes of moving in together to have a place to live and call a home. I can easily see she's not attempting to used me for that as well but rather would like to build a life with me and has even raised the topic of eventual marriage. It's all moving way too fast for me, and in all honesty I find myself talking to a friend  I've had a huge crush (yes, crush) since high school but never had the chance to fully pursue. Lets call her Kelsey. I should add that i ended up leaving Jenny for Kelsey two years ago (for numerous other reasons including Jenny lying to and cheating on me) and had a brief thing with her over the summer but ended up going back to Jenny. I can tell she obviously has feelings for me lately an I'd definitely enjoy finally knowing if Kelsey (f,19) would have worked out if we had gone beyond a common summertime squeeze. Even so, I don't think going any further with Jenny would be wise for me being that I'd be unhappy. Breaking it off before it becomes a relationship would be hard being that she's so set on a new life with me blossoming out of it and having a place to live and call home. I don't want to hurt her because I really would love to see her become successful and build her own life for herself. Is there any easier way to tell her how I feel without her doing anything stupid being that has a past of being self destructive? Yeah, I know this sounds very much like a textbook high school love triangle but breakups have never been my forte. Thanks in advance for any advice!

We broke up after a few months maybe, got back together after a couple more, then broke up again.  Both times it was my doing.  Both times it went horribly. I could've handled the situation a lot better but she definitely did not keep her shit together, so much that when we last got back together I expressed hesitantce on the possibility of another ugly breakup.

During our second break I started biking a lot.  I found myself suddenly in shape and confident for once in my life.  I decided I would go back to school in the fall.  Life was great.  I had ambition and plans and a thirst for life.  Sometime a little after, GF and I started hooking-up regularly.  I was convinced we could have a friendship with benefits (ha!).  Needless to say, she drunkenly professed her love to me one night.  I liked her and thought it was worth a shot.

Maybe a month later my life is a wreck.  Depression and anxiety, things I'd wrestled with since high school's end and arguably longer, made a grand reentry to my life.  I had dropped out of school, my job was seriously stressing me, I desperately wanted out of my housing situation, etc.  One night I burst into tears and asked GF is she would move in.  I couldn't afford my own place and thought this was the only option.  Soon after I said the ""I love you"" (I don't think this was a lie).  But my life continued to spiral downward and I soon found myself hospitalized for mental issues.

I made it out (THANK GOD) and moved in with my parents, 2 hours away from GF.  I should add that GF was the only person other than my parents who visited me in the hospital.  I had never been so excited to see her, and knowing she accepted me at my lowest really raised her standing in my eyes. I decided to move closer to GF after a few months.  When I discussed possible roommates with her, she grew sad, thinking the move-in proposal still stood.  We ended up getting a house together in the college town.

I wasn't ready to move out on my own again.  I had been doing nothing but smoking pot and eating crap food, living a nothing lifestyle.  GF and I got in many fights about this, with her voicing her displeasure at my lifestyle and my lack of commitment to the relationship.  I was quick to apologize, tell her I would try harder.  I usually would for a few days but I would end up back in my ways.

Cue the last week.  I ran into a female friend I hung out with back in my skinnier, more active days.  We were both really excited to see each other and exchanged numbers to hang out soon.  I did not have any intention to pursue her or cheat on GF.  But it was mighty refreshing to run into a woman so unlike GF.  For some reason this elevated mood persisted and I'm now biking again, feeling great, hungry for life.  But during this time I came to the conclusion that GF is not the woman for me, nor am I the man for her.  I feel like I've been in denial of this for a long time.  I've probably had waves of doubts about the relationship since we moved in.  Some weeks I won't know what to think, other weeks it's perfectly fine.  But I feel at our best the relationship is ""OK"" and we both deserve better than that.

Ever since I came to this conclusion, the more I've thought about it the more it makes sense.  The relationship isn't often really ""unbearable,"" but it's not what I really want.  I don't think she's who I want to spend the rest of my life with, and my newfound confidence and happiness makes me want to play the field or at least see what else is out there.

There's some caveats though.  I was diagnosed bipolar by my shrink after my hospital stay.  There's a possibility this happiness and activeness is just a hypomanic swing, one that would send me back down to earth in some time and probably hard.  I feel pretty strongly my mood is a result of my increased activity and better decision making.  It feels exactly like the last time I biked every day, a mood that lasted for at least a few months and ended probably around when I stopped biking really at all.  But I'd be a fool to rule out the possibility.  I'm taking meds but they're a really low dosage.  I know my shrink could help me here but he's out of office for another month.

Also, tonight she had a kind of panic attack and told me nothing was going well to the point where she was "" thinking bad thoughts"" (I'm guessing mild suicidal thoughts, I've been there).  She was really freaking out and I realized she might not be in the best state to get her world shaken up even more.  I initially wanted to wait until the semester ended to break anything off, but this last week I keep thinking it should be sooner rather than later.  After tonight I just don't know.  It's going to be a train wreck of a breakup, I want to contain the damage as much as possible.  But I definitely don't want to abandon her during such an emotional period.

I've never been in such a long relationship—how do I know it really is time to end it?  I'm not at the ""I hate you"" point most couples tend to end up at before a break, but I also let a lot of things go pretty easily.  I feel pretty sure this is the right move, but I'd like some reassurances or questions to ask myself so as to know better.

More importantly, how do I pull the trigger?! It's going to probably be a disaster either way, but I bet reddit can come up with an easier way than just blurting out ""I don't want to do this anymore!!"" When do I do it?  I got dumped during a semester once and it just fueled my depression and gave me an excuse to drop out, I don't want to see her do the same.  As of right now I'm probably waiting for her to voice her displeasure in the relationship (we're probably due for this fight again, and yes they're definitely more fight than open discussion) to have an opening for ""well maybe this just isn't working out."" But that's kind of a pussy move, I probably need to be the one to bring it up.  Help me out reddit!

108917,Relationships,23u46q,"Hi Reddit, I've been a little distraught about a conversation I've had with my boyfriend. Don't know if I'm over thinking it, but would love to hear your perspective on things. 

A little info on me and my boyfriend, I am 20, I've unfortunately just realized i'm a complete hopeless romantic. I love love. To me there really is nothing greater than ""to love and be loved in return"" as the  quote goes. This is my third relationship that's lasted a year or more, this is my third time being in love though I do think I love him more than my past boyfriends. My boyfriend is 26. This is his fifth relationship that's lasted a year or more. He and his other four girlfriends all broke up somewhere between a year and a half and two years. He's not very emotional and he really places greater value on his career than on his relationships with people, the opposite of me. He also is very very honest. Sometimes the things he says are not what I want to hear, but at least I never doubt if he is really saying what he means.

Now, let's go back to Valentine's day. I told him I loved him, and in a very polite way he told me he doesn't love me. It was awful. He told me he's said ""I love you"" to people before and then later he realizes he didn't love them, but he told me he cares deeply for me, and I will always have a place in his heart no matter what, but he can't say he loves me until he knows he wants to be with me forever. I told him that just because I love him doesn't mean I want to be with him forever, it just means I love him and that I'm twenty and the idea of committing to someone forever is equally as terrifying as being alone forever to me, but I still love him. I told him I want him in my life in a year, but I honestly can't say I know that yet for five years and he agreed. He also said he's hopeful for us, and that he hopes he can get to a place with me in which he is sure he wants to be with me forever and if he didn't think that was possible then he wouldn't be with me right now.

I convinced myself that day that people fall in love at different times, and not to rush him into it. I also told myself we care about each other the same amount we just have different definitions of ""love."" My definition is more ""I adore you, I want to spend time with you often, your happiness makes me happy"" and his is ""I want to be with you forever."" That day I felt like we had the same level of emotions for each other and convinced myself not to focus on the label.

It's been bugging me ever since. So this weekend I brought up the conversation again. I told him ""I know I haven't said I love you since Valentine's day, but I want you to know I'm not taking it back because you didn't say it, I still love you, I just don't want to make you uncomfortable because you didn't say it back, and I want you to say it when you mean it. However, I do have a fear that in two years we'll be together and you still will of never said it to me."" He told me he couldn't really tell me anything comforting at that moment because the only thing that would make me feel better was him saying ""I love you"" and he still wasn't there yet, which was fine. Now for the red flag. He told me he's dated four other girls. One for two years, two for a year and a half, and then another for two years, and he can honestly say he hasn't loved any of them. This scares the shit out of me. I'm starting to wonder if he just doesn't have any love to give me. Love is such an important thing to me. The more love in life the better, but I honestly don't know if he's capable of ever loving me. I'm really worried I'll spend all this time loving him and two years down the line never have received anything back. That's way worse than loving and losing it. It's never getting any love at all. 

In the same conversation he said he honestly likes me more than any of the girls he has dated. Also, he's been really busy with his career these past few months and he told me if he was dating any of those girls during this time in his life when he was so busy with work he would of dumped them by now, but he likes me more than any of them so that's why he always makes sure to make time for me in his busy schedule and that's why we've lasted. He also said while he's been dating me he's been the least selfish he's ever been and this is the hardest he's ever worked for a relationship. I know he's not lying because he wouldn't of said anything nice in that moment if he didn't believe what he was saying.

I don't know if I should leave now because it seems like he can't give me something that I need, or wait and see if maybe one day he can tell me he loves me. also apologies for the length and mania of this post. I'm a little upset right now.

Hey reddit I'm in desperate need of some advice. It may seem long, but please, please read and help me, I need some serious advice :)

There is this girl I like (we are both 13) and have been in the same class for a 2 years. Around a year ago, we both stated we liked each other but nothing came of it.

But in geography I sit next to her (seating plan), and things kicked off like that. She kept looking at me, gently kicking me and showing signals etc.

Then yesterday on at lunch she came up to me and said 'you're fit', I said thanks, you too.

Then next lesson, I sat in front of her and she kept calling me sexy etc. she asked me if I liked any girl and I said 'yes one in particular' she kepted asking me questions like does she begin with 'e' and have brown hair which she does, and I said yes. It was pretty obvious now we both liked each other. Her friend kept pressuring us to go out, so it was like 10 seconds till the end of the day so I asked and just before she answered the bell rang.

After an hour, she texted me 'hey it's her name (let's call her lucy for just the purpose of this post) and added kissed on the end. She texted, and she seemed happy, like she was always replying, texting first, and using xxxxs. I snap chatted her and she was like 'hey sexy' and I said the same thing..

It was quite late, I asked her why she liked me, she said she trusts me and am really really sweet. I said she was kind and good looking, and she called me 'cutie'.

She asked me what I would say if she asked me out and I said yes.

She asked if She would be my first girlfriend and said yes and she said 'awww ;)'

After some messaging she called me babe etc. at around 23.00 I asked her if she had thoight any more about going out with me. She said she was tired and tell me tomorow and it was probaly yes.

So I wait for the next day (today), I text her good morning, and if she could tell me her full answer. She said 'I don't want to go out with you now, but I will do soon ;) xxxx' a little sad I asked her why, she said she isn't ready for a relationship.

She has gone out with around 6people before, but I think no one in the past 2 months, whereas it have never gone out with anyone.

I found this weird because she was so obsessed with me Irl, but when I asked her out she was hesitant.

What should I do and does she like me and will she go out with me?

Thanks reddit, ik I can always come to you. Please help :)

13192,Relationships,1gzbxa,"All right... Where to begin? Way back when, I guess. During the school year I would pick up little hints that my roommate (let's call him G) had kind of a thing for my girlfriend. He would try to get her alone, away from me, consistently, and when I'd object I'd be told relax, I'm just a friend to her. Fast forward a couple months: she (let's call her K) and I had a big argument, and we broke up (sort of). At this time I noticed him appearing kind of happy- happier than I'd seen before, at least. He was talking about how he wanted to go to the same grad school as her, etc etc. She came back the next day, we apologized to each other, and said we could work things out (we did, and are in a better place now- but I digress). When he found out, I then noticed another change in behavior- he seemed very upset for quite a while. Slamming things like books, doors, generally being even more antisocial than usual.

Fast forward a few more months... K and I are kind of getting tired of G, for a myriad of reasons I won't really get into, save that we found out he was kind of dishonest, hypocritical and he had bad hygiene. He appeared to be trying harder to be her friend, while she tried distancing herself from him gently.

Skip forward another couple months to yesterday: I come back from a 4-day vacation at my friend's house on Cape Cod to find that he's sent her several messages on her Facebook timeline. These messages say things like I was talking as if you were here, but then I realized I was talking to myself and you weren't here and I got really sad, and we should go on a trip to Russia and Europe together!, among other things. I noticed these, and immediately asked her what was going on- these messages were ramping up their level of creepiness. She and I agreed that they should stop, so she sent him the following message:

Hey G, can you cool it down with the comments on Facebook? They're coming off creepy and weirding out some of my friends and me a little, even if you don't mean it. Tone it down a little - I will see you at school. Psno1994 and I are still going strong, and you and I are just going to stay friends. Nothing more, okay?

He responded with:

Uhhh, okay? I don't see how it was suggestive, but okay.

To which I replied to him with:

Just to be clear- you need to back off of K. Suggesting things like that you're unhappy when she's not around, or that you want to go on a trip through Europe with her, are crossing a serious line. This is your warning. Respect the relationship I have with her and back the fuck off.

He then became aggressive, and our conversation became this:

G: I'm sorry, I can't hear you over your irrational ranting. Feel free to get back to me when you are done with your little tantrum

Me: I had better never see your face around. If you believe that you can continue getting all creepy with my girlfriend, and that you can then disrespect me on top of that, you are going to have a very bad time. Now please stop messaging me. I want nothing more to do with you.

G: Disrespect you? Hardly. I simply made an accurate point. I am not catering to your paranoid fantasies when I've made my stace so very clear

I then replied that he should leave us both alone. K also sent him several messages saying that she does not want anything more to do with him. Did I handle this right, and if he tries to further contact her, how should I respond?

TL;DR ex-roommate began getting creepy with his interactions with my girlfriend, she and I responded by asking him to stop and he tried claiming that his intentions weren't bad, despite the suggestions in his behavior and messages to her.

I've been dating my boyfriend for 6 months now and things have been amazing so far, crazy sex life, get on like best friends and love each other's families etc. The other day I was using his laptop (not snooping, I know how this subreddit hates that) and saw that he was saved into some.. interesting sites. 


Let me first say that I have absolutely no problem with him or anyone watching porn - I expect it. But what threw me off was that he is paying a $30 monthly subscription to at least 2 sites... 


The reason this is bothering me is that I was under the impression that anything someone could want, is free to find on the internet, so always thought paying for porn was a desperate thing that only weird lonely people would do (I'm so sorry if I'm offending anyone). Since seeing this on his computer, I can't help but feel less attracted to him as I find it creepy that he would pay for something like this. Especially seeing as he is always strapped for cash. I also now feel a bit inadequate sexually; he's paying for something else that I can't give??

168485,Relationships,2nzi7m,"Fiance and I have been together for 4+ years and recently got engaged. I started a new job early this year and, not to brag, have been doing phenomenal. I work in the PR department of a very well-known, high-profile company. I'm a recent college graduate - so to be doing this well is extra special.  I work with a wonderful group of people who are all very proud of my accomplishments, and are all very excited to meet my new fiance.

We have a holiday party coming up in the next few weeks, and everyone brings their SO.  This is a chance for my coworkers to meet my fiance. We have staff members (including our department's VP) flying in from out of town to be there. An award is being presented for the most valuable team member for that year. It is a very big event.

Other than an all-company bbq, my SO has only been to ""work events"" where it is just me and him, and we usually have received free tickets to an event in town.

My SO is in medical school. I have been to countless social events with him and his classmates (who I enjoy very much). I'm there to support him during his ceremonies, during some non-class doctor community lectures, and I'm equally supportive of his already wonky schedule, and when he goes out to party with his classmates on a weekday after a big test.

Even though SO has known for weeks that our company holiday party, he is now saying that he has a medical school secret study party the night of the holiday party, and that he wont be attending.  I had to RSVP us both very far in advance, and the party is at a very nice restaurant. 

Now I'm very frustrated. We don't usually fight, neither of us are manipulators, and we are both usually very flexible with one another. I'm so confused as to why he is being such a stone wall about this issue. I don't usually press for him to attend things with me - this is the only work event I have asked him to go to that isn't *just* about the free food/show/etc he can see also.

Am I being unreasonable? Do I have a right to be angry about this? I feel like part of the problem is that I can't quite explain to my fiance why events like this are important for me and my career. I'm frustrated because we usually support each other so willingly, and this is a time where he is not. Maybe I'm the one being selfish. Or maybe it's him. Or us both.

EDIT: Our events are at about the same time, with his beginning a half hour before mine and ending a half hour after. He also has no idea what is going on at his med school party, but it is a ""tradition to go before you take your final""

49075,Infidelity,35idtx,"So I've known this girl Jenna [20f] (not a real name) for about two months we met at a party and just sorta hit it off in a friendly way. We weren't being flirty or anything of that nature just enjoying playing beer games with some other friends. At the end of the night a few of us exchange numbers and decide we should meet up again sometime.


We've only hung out a handful of times and never just the two of us, we'd do stuff like movies, bowling, and go to the beach and again nothing was ever flirty just our usual joking around in the group.


Over the course of the next couple of weeks I add her on social media (Facebook, snapchat, etc.) along with our other friends. Keep in mind I never really saw this girl as a romantic interest I had just gotten out of a crappy long term relationship that ended with me being cheated on so I was just enjoying the single life taking things as they came. 


Fast forward to two nights ago and early in the day Jenna asks if I want to catch a movie with her and I said sure. A few hours later she asks if we can just watch a movie at my place and again I agree not thinking much of it (I have my oblivious moments). So the night goes pretty good we have snacks a movie and we're just talking about random things about each other, asking what we got our moms for Mother's Day (call your mom if you haven't already),and etc. 


Halfway through the movie she just leans on me and it throws me off a little bit, but I lift my arm around her and she goes for it and lays her head on me. After this we don't say another word for the rest of the movie and as soon as it ends she sits up looks at me and kisses me. Now while she's kissing me my conscious and I are having an internal debate as to what the fuck is going on. Again I never saw her this way up until 45 minutes ago and she's very attractive so turning her away wasn't in my more basic wants better interest. 


We're still making out on the couch and I'm not sure where she wants to go with this just yet, but eventually she climbs on top of me and one thing leads to another. After its all said and done I'm not really sure what to say to her. I don't know why, but the first thing I do say to her is Uh, so are we still friends? She just sorta chuckles at me and says yeah.  She goes to the bathroom to clean up and her phone starts going off in her purse, she immediately yells Don't answer it! I just laugh and say why would I? She comes out and checks it and says she's gotta get going home as she has to take a friend somewhere early tomorrow. I walk her to her car say goodbye exchange a kiss and she goes home. 


When I got back inside I started thinking of why I didn't see this coming and why she was so sketchy about the phone going off, so I go to social media to see if there's any sort of evidence in our history that she was into me. Just a heads up I don't really go on Facebook for anything anyways I just usually open it to get rid of the damn notifications that show up on the app icon. So I haven't actually creeped on this girls page until now. As soon as I start looking through it the pieces are starting to come together in my head. I notice that there is a guy who often tags her in posts so I click on his profile and see that he has a bunch of pictures of her and him in the way you would expect to see a couple acting (holding each other, holding hands, stuff like that). His profile also indicates that he is in a relationship, but it doesn't say who with. I quickly go back to her page and she doesn't have any sort of relationship indicator. She also has no pictures of him, but you can still see she's liking and commenting on some of the posts this guy tags her in. 


I feel sick to my stomach as not that long ago I was the guy getting cheated on. I haven't really talked with her since aside from a few snap chats here and there, but I don't know where to go from here. Do I tell her what I think, skip her and message the guy, or just nope out of here and be on with my life?

She often has groceries to put away or things to bring in from the car (works at a grocery store).

Now, I'm fine with helping, and while I have fallen short in the past, I am trying to improve. Typically, when I say ""I'll help you in five or ten minutes, let me wrap up whatever I'm doing,"" she will proceed to do whatever herself, getting understandably more flustered. This always results in her yelling at me within the next hour, sometimes about an unrelated topic(some nights I take too many sentences to say something to her for instance, some nights I'm a jerk for not helping - which I find reasonable).

We see a relationship counselor, who suggested that she call/text me when she leaves work to give me a heads up so I can pull out of my head/focus for when she gets home.

Over the weekend, we were at a house with friends of mine. I have an extremely anti-authoritarian personality, on which I am working, but it's kinda fundamental to me. I was trying to explain to my friends how typical ""child-discipline"" techniques fell short when used with me as a child. My wife pops in and says that's not true, and that she has to use child-discipline techniques on me as an adult to get desired behaviors. She said it's very annoying that she has to prime me ""like a child"" when she is on her way home.

I was in a difficult situation - I could not defend myself without the risk of turning my friends' table into a war zone, and I kept quiet.
But I despise being compared to a child, I despise her exerting any sense of control over me, and I am especially hurt that our mutual compromise to try to make things better between us was ridiculed in a way that emasculinated me in front of my friends. I am deeply offended about the implication that I am behaving as a child when this is actually a method used to keep her from throwing a tantrum.
I need to know, am I being ridiculous about this? Things have been very difficult lately, I'm miserable and I'm thinking of leaving. But I'm still here, and I'm still trying - but how can I proceed when she takes something that we decided to try as a compromise and ridicules me with it like that in front of others?

**tl;dr**: Wife insulted my maturity in front of friends, surrounding a compromise behavior we had established with a relationship counselor... how mad is ok to be?

Edit:  The variance in opinions on here is fantastic. :-)  Thank you for the support, and the criticism - I'll try to apply it to better understand where she's coming from.

On summer vacation we had a fight and decided to part ways, it was our 10th month relationship. It was a strange separation, mixed contact and no contact. I preferred no contact for the senses. This went on for several months, but it was felt that we need each other. I started doing it moves as friend, at some point, I realized that it can not continue, and we must make a decision. We discussed all, she was not sure of her feelings, afraid that's all gone, but felt sympathy toward me as before, interest, and communication, so we decided to try again. The first three weeks were excellent for both of us, her friends have told me how she was glad to be back with me. Sex, meetings, communication, everything seemed fine. We had a wonderful New Year.

She had to leave for a week to work with children in the camp, and during that time all broke. Upon arrival, she seemed extremely no emotional for me, distant. We talked and she said that she does not want anything at all, she tried and the first weeks was fine, but after NY something went wrong and she does not know why. She said that she was with me well, I attract her, but she did not want anything in general. I asked, can anyone else attracts you, the answer was negative. She does not understand what happened and this is the most cruel, I could take anything, but not nothing. This is the first serious relationship, and I recently became her first lover, and I especially do not understand what happened.

I decided not to talk for a while, until her mind to all that is the best solution. She was against it, but I insisted. It pains me to communicate and stay with the person to whom I am in love, especially when I know that I attract her too.

4th day of No Contact, today she asked me in social media how's my 2nd exam was. I was not in the network since this question, too often go to her page and distracted during the preparation for the following exams.
any advice?

Been a long time lurker and created an account to post this.
I am worried about my SO spending habits. I have known and been friends with this guy for 6 years and both are aware of each others financial situation. He seems incapable to save a dime even though he earns almost double of what I do.

Both of us have upcoming birthdays, mine in end November and his beginning and  I have this ritual where I buy myself something nice on my birthday after saving up for months,
so I had some money stacked.

Two weeks into the relationship my So starts asking me what am I planning for his birthday and gift. I had a nice watch  in mind and have checked with his friends for availability on his birthday,so I said I got it covered.

Three days ago he went to see his brother in law and fell in love with a pretty high end DSLR. He said he wanted that as a birthday gift.

As I had a some money saved, I put my plans to buy something for myself on hold and agreed to buy him the camera he wanted. We discussed and settled on one. I have to leave early for work and he agreed to buy the camera alone.

Yesterday, he was browsing online and ended up buying a DSLR which was double the price bucket I was expecting using my account for down-payment and put me up for months of high payment EMIs.

I came home to see a huge dent in my savings was somewhat upset.

I discussed with him whether he considered this a responsible behavior to spend so much on a whim and what was I supposed to do if I get stuck in a situation and find myself low on money.

His answer was I could always ask my parents as they are sort of well to do and I am an only child.

I could not discuss further as it was supposed to be a birthday gift and sounded petty. I have been living on my own for years and a firm believer of carrying your own weight. This behavior just pisses me off.


As petty as this sounds, what makes me more angry is after all this racket for his birthday, I am not sure I will be able to enjoy mine with such a huge financial burden. I have never been in this situation before.

13683,Dating,29kbej,"I was laid off from work and sent a FB friend req to a coworker. He accepted it after a few days. I wrote him a friendly message asking how he was. He wrote back after a few days and suggested we get drinks once he's back home (he's been overseas on a work project for a month). I responded positively and gave him my number, suggesting he text me once he's back.

I'm pretty sure he's back now, and he still hasn't messaged me. I'm thinking that I've done my best and should wait for him to contact me. I know if I were in his position that the only reason I wouldn't make contact would be if I wasn't that interested. I wouldn't forget an potential opportunity with someone I genuinely liked.

Anyway, my friend's saying I should message him toremind him of our messaging exchange. Surely that's desperate and I can let this one go? :-/ I've been rejected so many times when I've put myself out there in similar situations that I'm really keen to avoid it this time. I don't want to make him feel obliged to see me - that seems like it'd be terribly awkward and ultimately pointless.

166917,Non-Romantic,3crcdt,"Forgive the confusing title.
I've known my best friend for 10+ years. So me and his GF have had an on-off friendship for the last 2 years, and recently we started talking again. In the past we've stopped being friends because of some differences. Anyway, It's been about 3-4 weeks since we started talking again, and we got really close lately. Close as in I stay up on the phone with her for hours talking about her personal life and problems she deals with and I give her advice and support her unconditionally with her relationship and goals.

Her biggest problem is that she overreacts a lot emotionally. She knows that I make inappropriate jokes a lot of the time. Lately, she's been getting more comfortable with my weird sense of humor, so now me and her can harmlessly insult each other without getting mad because we both know we're kidding. So yesterday I went out with my best friend and her, and while hanging out, I called her ugly as fuck (obviously I was kidding) she took MASSIVE offense to it and cursed me out. I didn't expect her to react like that because it was established that I say dumb inappropriate stuff, and she does it right back to me. Whenever she insults me, I never get offended because I know she doesn't intend to hurt me. She says equally as rude things to me and I never care.

So I talked to my best-friend after it happened, and he's very upset because he feels that I've ""disrespected"" his girlfriend, yet I feel like I haven't done anything wrong because I assumed she knew I was kidding like I normally do. She was in a bad mood that day which probably led to her unusual outburst, but the point is that she is very emotionally volatile. One day me and her talk shit back and forth to each other harmlessly, and the next it blows up in my face. So at this point I don't know how to act around her. I constantly feel like I have to bite my tongue. One second she is okay, the next she is freaking out about something trivial and insignificant. I can't be myself around her at all. So now my best friend is saying he wants to abandon our friendship, (Yes the one we've forged over 10+ years), and I feel like I don't owe her an apology for her inability to control her emotions. 

He says its hard being stuck between me and her because he can never make anybody happy. But I'm just disturbed that he is willing to abandon our friendship over this relationship he's had for only a few years. I've done so many good things for his life and he's always told me how much he cared about me and now he wants to forsake my friendship over one ""mistake"" that I've apparently made.

126184,Relationships,1tfd2a,"TL;DR; M29 F25 Chinese wife thinks I have yellow fever, I'm offended &amp; disagree, how to get this out of her head?


I'm a M 29 married about 1yr to F 25. I have always been really into various cultures, but particularly Asian, mostly Japanese. I went to a very good, multicultural high-school, so many of my friends growing up were from Europe, Asia, etc. I've also been into Anime from a young age.


I bartended for over 5 years, and have always been really good at talking to women. I've dated many, and been sexual active since about 15 years old. Despite my interest in Asian philosophy, art, food, and media, I have never really been particularly attracted to Asian women. Of the 30 or so relationships I've had, 4 were pretty serious, one almost resulted in an engagement, and only 1 very brief one involved a Japanese-French mix, who didn't seem to care about the ethnicity difference at all.


My wife is from China, was here for work, planning to stay a few years for career experience, and then go back home. She's pretty cultured too, and speaks Mandarin, Cantonese, Italian, Japanese, and obviously English pretty fluently. We have a very amicable relationship, and value each other's input and opinions.


Recently though, we've been having some arguments, mostly where she accuses me of having ""yellow fever"" - i.e. being obsessed with Asian girls/culture. At first I was almost confused, since I've actually only encountered the term a few times, and didn't really think it was something of any weight. After a few of these, I began to take serious offense to it. Not only is my ""ideal"" girl not Asian, but I have a hearty interest in many other cultures - specifically my Italian/Sicilian roots - and also like media, food, literature, art, etc. from them.


I even learned to speak a little Pidgin English (mostly spoken in the Solomon Islands) after becoming good friends with a guy who's from there. I'm an expert in coffee and scotch. I know the origins of cryptography and how war times have influenced our technology even to the way this very website is using security. I just have an aficionado, enthusiast, knowledge/experience hungry personality. I get deep into anything I find interesting.


So my question is, for anyone who's encountered this situation before, how do I convey my sincerity in not being ""Asian obsessed""? She's convinced that she's no different from my ""white"" (non-Asian) ex girlfriends and that I'm with her b/c she's Asian. I expressed how I fell in love with her personality, and the deep connection we have when we're together - not her eyes or cheekbone structure. It just seems so ridiculous to me. I know there are guys out there who probably do only like Asians, but to me, the line between us is large and clear. I know it's partly her self-esteem, and I try to be supportive and uplifting of that as much as possible, but I just seem to be falling short.

We met 6 years ago at the start of 6th grade and became instant best friends. Right from the start I had the hugest crush on him but was convinced he didn't like me so I kept quite. 3/4 through 7th grade he moved a city over, I was devastated I would hardly get to see one of my only best friends so we decided to always play online games and do rp forums together. We 'dated' online for about a month before he said we should just wait till we can see each other.

He had to go through his mom going to jail for about a year and living with an aunt and uncle that hated his mother and him so they horribly mistreated him for a year and a half, ruining his perception of himself.

We kept talking online through the years, entering 9th grade I was positive I had fallen in love with him. I couldn't like other guys or even think about dating them because all I could think about was him. 

I waited 5 years just to see his face again. So last November we finally met up and a night of confessing our love to each other and spent the whole day together. We instantly clicked as a couple and everything went great dating wise.

However he is horribly self conscious and thinks terribly of himself and his worth, which I have tried to help him realize how great he is and how much he has improved in making music (his only passion) but he never really got to see it.

We just passed 4 months and after 4 days of not sleeping he came to me with a question that shook me up. (We have already talked a whole bunch about our plans after high school including apartments, marriage and children in 6 or so years) He sent me, Do you really love me or are you just in love with the idea of me? It took me a bit but I was able to fully convey how much I am in love with him and not just the idea.

The problem:

Earlier today however he told me he needs time alone. When asked what's wrong he said he doesn't feel like he fits for a relationship as good as this (he constantly worries that he isn't a good boyfriend which I try to debunk) and that he might just not fit for any relationship. He said he needs time to think and that he doesn't deserve me and he would only ruin my future and that I would regret being with him.

I've thought about showing up to his house (which is 45min by car, 3 hours by bus) to surprise him and show I'm willing to fight for this but I'm worried that might just interrupt his thinking time and could actually make him want to break up with me. (We talk through things A LOT, because I hate misunderstandings)

I really need some advice and help what to do, I can't lose him. I've waited for him and I just finally got him.

I've been working there for 4 years and Abbey started about 6 months after me. I work part time and don't go into the office, I just request jobs I want and then go work them, I also have an un-related 9-5 job. Abbey graduated college and didn't find a job so now she works in the office for the company and also picks up jobs for the company... kind of like how temp agencies work, so it's like she works for the temp agency in the office, but also picks up the jobs that they have available.

So since Abbey works in the office, she usually puts herself onto the jobs she wants before it goes into the system and anyone else can request it. There was a particular job that I heard about and I was more qualified than her for this particular job so I sent my boss an email stating that the job wasn't in the system yet, but that I wanted it and gave my reasons why I was qualified for it and that I wasn't happy that these things tend to get taken before  entered into the system.

Someone else in the office, Mary, saw my email and didn't think it pertained to her so she marked it as unread so that my boss could read it.

The next day I inquire to my boss about my email because I see that the job went into the system and that Abbey is already on it. He says he never got my email. When I talk to Mary about it, Mary stated that she read it and when she goes to look for it, she can't find it. She checked the deleted folder, and nothing there. Mary then does a recovery on the deleted emails and finds that only my email was purged from the trash.

There was no one else in the office that would have reason to delete my email and then delete it from the trash. Also Abbey has proven in the past to do very self-serving things and to blatantly lie to get out of doing things she doesn't want to do or lie to get the jobs she wants.

I still have jobs in the future where I will have to work with Abbey. Do I confront her about this? I don't know how to act around her anymore and I've totally lost all respect for her...

59791,Relationships,1ls1rj,"So I met my SO last year while I was in his town short-term and we both fell pretty hard for each other, leading to a long distance relationship with many trips to see one another, talking on the phone everyday, Skype sessions, the works. We've had our normal minor issues, especially in regards to communication, which I just attributed to the distance. But otherwise, we've been solid for our time together (which has been about 14 months).


I moved across the country for an awesome job but mostly to be with him. I'm a fairly independent person so I always knew that I wanted to build a life here, whether or not we were together. The first few months were awesome and we were in pure bliss of finally living in the same city. The last few weeks...not so much.


I've had a few emotional hiccups since I've been here, just in regards to making such a big change and not knowing that many people. In retrospect, I've made some good friends here and have a good job, but still I get a little overwhelmed by the whole thing sometimes. I have expressed this to him, simply because he is the person I talk to about these things but I have never thought of him as the cause or person responsible for my happiness.


But a few weeks ago, I had a bad day and I talked to him about it and since then he has been emotionally distant and cold towards me which leads to him being borderline rude. He says its work stuff bothering him but the other night he finally told me that he also feels responsible for my  happiness, even though he knows he shouldn't. We had a good conversation about this - how he pulls away when he feels stressed and how I need to always talk though stuff but didn't really resolve any of the issues.


Basically I've decided to give him his space emotionally but we still see each other a lot because of mutual friends. But now it honestly feels like he is very disinterested in me - ie. completely ignores me when I'm talking to him, never is available to hang out with me unless he just comes over to veg out and spend the night, laughed and said no point blank when I just asked him if he wanted to come to my friend's party (I hang out with his friends all the time but he has hung out with mine just one other time). I'm getting pretty fed up with this emotional distance and am not sure if I should just break up with him or not. I'm clearly unhappy with this but I haven't been in many long relationships so I'm not sure if I should give him some time since I moved so far for him. What do you guys think?

She has tweeted about me a lot, but she calls me by my nickname instead of the short version of my name (not sure what you guys would call the person you were dating)

Obviously she understands I have a crush on her, and I suggested to her yesterday about kicking out the other girl, but she said that she WANTED her to stay(im fairly sure she isnt just saying that just because thats what girls do). I'm not sure how serious the relationship is, I was hoping to have at least a semi-serious relationship (it can be partly a joke I dont mind) with her.

68932,Relationships,24hwv6,"We met this school year when we both needed somewhere to stay for college. We live in a coed house with other roommates. We got along very well and realized we had many shared interested we turned into best friends and eventually started dating. We knew it wasn't the best idea since we lived together but it was unavoidable. 

We both had recently gotten out of long term relationships and would talk to each other about them openly. When we entered an offical relationship I cut off contact with my Ex, he however still talked to his ex pretty frequently. I have a lot more ex's than he does so when I entered the relationships I reassured him non of my ex's would get in the way. 

Well I found out in January of this year he cheated on me with his ex over thanksgiving break. I was very hurt by this for obvious reasons. He reassured me he felt bad and kept the lie to himself because he didn't want to lose me. I forgave him because he promised to never do it again and started to show that he cared about me a lot. 

He was on probation our entire first semester of college and could not drink alcohol or party at all because he frequently got drug tested. I would stay in with him and watch movies so he wouldn't be lonely or bored. He had just moved to this school and this was my third year at this school so I knew many people while he didn't have many friends. 

Winter break he was not able to go home for christmas due to his probation so I went home for a week and spent time with my family and came back to my college town so he wouldn't be here alone. He also had to complete a lot of community service and didn't have a car to get around so i decided to help him get it done and would drive him around and let him use my car ect. When he got off probation he changed. He was now able to party and I felt like he used me for rides and company on the weekends when he wasn't able to go out and meet people. 

Well in the middle of march I found out that my mother has cancer and has to get surgery and receive treatment. Instead of being there for me he started to withdraw from me and go out with his guy friends more often and I caught him multiple times talking to other girls on fb and being flirty. His excuse was that he had only been with 2 girls and he knew I had been with many more and needed to boost his number for ego reasons. I instantly broke up with him but I am having a very hard time getting over this entire situation. I was there for him when he needed me but he decided to push me away when I needed him. Its hard because we live together so for the sake of our other roomates I need to keep a civil/friendly relationship. We are friends some days but enemies others. Its been very difficult to stay sane throughout all of this. There a 50/50 chance of us loving each other or hating each other every day. Sometimes we will be great friends having a good time but as soon as he whips out his phone ill ask him who he's texting and He'll admit its his ex. It drives me insane..  I know he's txting her all the time and it hurts to know that he never really cared about me and just used me. He constantly calls me crazy for caring that he is still talking to his ex and asking him if he is seeing anyone else. I cant stand for him to remember me as crazy after all I've done for him. How do I change his perspective?

My question is what do you guys think I should do to make me feel better about this situation and help myself out for the long run. Im hurt every time I see his face, I cant stand the ups and down of our relationship. How should I approach this situation for now on to regain my happiness and sanity. He is still one of my favorite friends but our relationship is horrible.

This is my first post on any account so forgive me!

Short history: I met my current girlfriend around 9 months ago and we hit it off immediately. We had a bit of drama caused by a friend of mine who was apparently interested, but have her no sign and she had had no interest in him. 

She has been very open with me about all of her past. She had one very long term relationship, she has had a couple of abusive ones, and then she spend a long time single having one night stands etc generally trying to figure out who she was. This is when she met the ex in question...

She has told me a lot about him. She only met him in person a handful of times over a long period of time, he often went weeks without messaging her, frustrating her no end. She tried to meet him some more (he lived a few hours away) and he stood her up a couple of times. She kept getting very angry at herself but couldn't seem to let him go. 

Anyway, since she met me he was silent for some time, but a month or two in he started messaging again. I told her it made me a little uncomfortable, but he assured me she just wants to be friends and would tell me what they talk about(I didn't ask). 

The ex will often talk nicely for a while and then become very flirty or sexual, in which case she will ignore him or just the thing he said and carry on. 

We have had some tough times recently with her health. I found it very stressful as she was off work and needed a lot of care for a while, whereas although my work was helpful and let me work from her house, I still had to work alongside helping her. It made me a bit distant emotionally and caused an argument. 

Since the argument she has acted a little strangely a couple of times, for example: as I said we share everything. I know the majority of her passwords even. I was using her laptop to look something up, and she noticed her facebook was open in a tab. She asked for the laptop back and I obliged and she quickly signed out of facebook and closed the tab (her Facebookprompts her phone if anyone tries to sign in) and handed it straight back. She has never done that before. 

I've had opportunity to have a look at the conversation but I haven't as I know it's a slippery slope and I have more respect for her and myself than to do that. 

She gets quite defensive when I talk about the ex and it making me insecure. 

On the bright side and perhaps more confusing, is she still makes a load of plans for the future with me, going places etc even booking them. I feel like it would be easy for that behaviour to slip if she was having major doubts?

I am super confused right now. I feel like I would be an ass to ask her not to talk to a friend even if he is one she has had romantic involvement with, but he does make me unaccountably insecure unlike any of her other past relationships. 

What can I do in this situation?! Sorry if there is too much or not enough relevant background here, I'll be happy to answer any questions in the comments!!

135712,Dating,31fbjo,"Okay, so here's the deal. 

I have recently left a very toxic college. It was just a place that turned everyone horrible and nasty. I lived in a different college before that one, and it was nowhere near as bad. 

Anyway, part of the toxicity was the treatment of the college towards virgins. Basically virgins were/are treated as stunted or idiots. Apparently because we're all so ""sexually repressed"" (like masturbation isn't a thing) girls who are virgins are all ""weird"" and you don't want to get too close to one. I once asked some friends what a new girl was like and they all rolled their eyes and went ""she's a virgin. You know."" 

Anyway because I was hanging out with the crowd that did this, and listening to all the bad stuff they said about being a virgin, I just went right ahead and lied to them. I said that I'd never been in a proper relationship but was in a FWB situation when I was 18, which was almost, but not quite, true. (We came close). 

The truth is that I never really liked anyone enough to give it up, so I didn't. 

Anyway, of course they believed this. We virgins are so good at blending in with normal people ;) Eventually it became a part of my identity. I must've lied to everyone I knew. My parents were desperate to know that I'd had experiences, so I told them similar tales. I became known not just as someone who had sex, but based on my appearance (big boobs, etc.) and confidant personality, someone who was an overly sexual being.  

Anyway, a new guy came to the college and, finally, I really like him! and, strangely enough, he seems to like me too. Only problem: he knows my so-called ""history"" from the people at college. And he has said, like every other guy at that college, that he'd never want to date a virgin. 

I know he's interested in me, but part of that ""me"" isn't a part that exists. I want to tell him about as much as I want to pull my own teeth out. What to do now?

EDIT: When I say college, I mean dormitory. A building with about 200 students in there. 

EDIT2: I wanted to thank you all for your comments, most of which I agree with. Yes, it is a horrible, cartoonishly horrible dorm. The whole virgin thing is just the tip of the iceberg. It could be because it's the only non-religious dorm on campus, I don't know. It's also the only dorm that allows alcohol and opposite genders going into each others room. It was great for the first six months, and then it slowly turned into a nightmare. 

As for my parents, yeah, they're weird. They're good parents otherwise though. Kind of. Better than some.

Again, thanks, this has helped me feel a lot better about the whole situation.

So basically it came out that she basically thought I would make a dad, saw how much having a family would mean to me when we babysat my nieces, and didn't want to rob me of that.  I told her  that I loved her and thought she should get therapy for some issues of hers before making that kind of decision. 

She then called my business partner and made false statements about me. 

She goes to the same college, I saw her staring at me near the beggining of semester, tried to say hi and be friendly, she caused a giant scene. the stress caused me to drop all classes of this semester and work. afraid that this is going to be a recurring problem. friends have been worried about me. it's been like 8 months now, I saw her randomly on the streets, while I was driving, didn't say anything, floored it. was 40 miles away next thing I knew. 

I basically am afraid now of what might happen, also: 
I haven't been able to date anyone else ever since. 
I have been pretty much dropping out of any social interactions, spending all my time at work or church. How far did I run to church to get away from my problems? In the process of catechesis, converting from roman catholic to eastern orthodox. because it's the only place I feel ok, is at church. So I fell in love with god and started looking into theology. a lot. 

Now I'm worried that I'm not motivated for anything else, I've started to fantasize about selling all my belongings and living a life of homeless piety for God. But then I just feel guilty, like how do I deserve to live with the same level of piety as a Saint?

24536,Relationships,1q34v1,"**Background:**

I've been dating my boyfriend for about 6 months now and it's getting pretty serious. Both of our families live in the same city that we do. I'm very close with my parents and siblings and I spend a fair amount of time with them. I grew up in a middle-class family, both my parents work(ed) blue-collar jobs, and I am the middle-est of 5 children. My boyfriend is the youngest of 5, his father has never been in the picture, and he spent most of his childhood bouncing around from foster homes to group homes to his mother's residence and back again. His mother has been in and out of his life, generally unsupportive, and somewhat unstable.

**The Problem:**
I don't understand my boyfriend's relationship with his mother. They talk on the phone, text, and he talks about her often in a very good light. The simple fact that he still maintains ANY relationship with her, after everything she put him through, is a mystery to me. She hasn't worked a day in the past decade, yet somehow finds the money to buy expensive things like iPads and cars. Meanwhile my boyfriend is struggling, working 70 hours/week trying to save up money to go to college. I don't understand how he doesn't resent the hell out of her, and that's exactly what I've come to do. Talking about her makes me uncomfortable. It's hard to explain, but when he finds time to help her when he's so busy with work, it breaks my heart and makes me mad! She'll stop by the restaurant where he works (a very up-scale place), will sit down for dinner, and he'll end up paying for it because he knows she can't afford it. It makes my blood boil!

The issue is that he has spend plenty of time with my family. He gets along with everyone and generally enjoys their company. I, however, have not actually even met his mother. The idea of spending time with her does not appeal to me at all. I know it's wrong to judge someone that you don't know, but it seems like I just can't help it. And the fact that he goes on about how awesome she is makes me want to meet her less. It just makes me sad and confused.

I know I'm going to have to meet her if this relationship with my boyfriend progresses, but I don't know what I'd even say to her. He knows I've been avoiding the issue, and I know that hurts him, but I don't know how to explain to him how uncomfortable I am with the whole situation.

Am I being too judgmental? Or is my boyfriend not understanding enough of my discomfort?

I got out of a somewhat broken codependent relationship a while back.  In my mind, I romanticize everything, and it's really hard for me to see all of the bad parts of it because she was very adamant about how much she loved me.

I've had a lot of trouble getting over my ex, and when I think I'm over her, I feel like I frequently go back to it.  I know this is really unhealthy, and I want to break the trend.  To be honest, the worst of it comes when I go on a date with someone and it doesn't work out.  I'm fairly picky with a lot of things, and I probably shouldn't be dating right now anyway.  But sometimes opportunities present themselves, and it seems dumb to turn them down.  When sparks don't fly between me and people, I feel really lost, and ultimately end up going back to place where I miss my ex.  (I've had one pretty alright fling with a cool girl, but it ended very quickly.)

My ex rejected me, and when I go out with people and I don't feel sparks with them, it makes me feel like my ex decided she was too ""good"" (hot, fun, etc..?) for me and that I don't deserve someone I loved like that.  That's a hard thing for me to admit, but I realize that a huge reason I feel lost is because when my dates with new people don't work out, the rejection from my breakup rears its head again, and it's been a long time.   I know I shouldn't feel this way, there's no reason to do so, and I'm scared because I know I'm in this cycle where I'm taking the codependency from that relationship and projecting it onto my new dating life.

The unfortunate thing is that I still have the bad habit to think of my ex as ""home base.""  I've always felt somewhat isolated from people, and my ex really ""got"" me.  It wasn't like I am a complete hermit, I have some friends, people think I'm a good guy, but my ex was the first person to make me feel really special, attractive, and sweet.  When we broke up I had an overwhelming sense that she realized she was wrong, and I wasn't those things.

I've had a hard time getting over it, because to be honest, I've realized that my biggest problem in dating isn't really my ""standards"" per se (I know I'm plenty physically attractive, and at one point have been a collected great boyfriend), but the fact that I'm looking to know that someone will feel this way about me again.  I do (honestly) get pretty lonely sometimes, and I have a nasty habit of remembering ""snapshots"" of loving / fun times with my ex that I concretized in my mind with the ""this is the love of my life"" feeling, snapshots of things like us going to the beach, or taking spontaneous drives at night.

I know rationally that someday I can probably do these things with someone else, but a part of me worries if I'm broken now, and if I'll ever be able to accept and love someone that much again.  I know that in my mind this is a product of the codependency of our relationship.  I consistently tell myself ""you can be all of the great person you were in that relationship outside of that relationship,"" but sometimes it just isn't enough.  As much as I know I *should* feel that way, I'm afraid I just *don't* feel that way sometimes.  Instead I find myself thinking about how confident I was when I was sure I'd see my ex come home and we'd talk about our days, and that I got that constant reinforcement about how attractive / great / kind / awesome she thought I was.

At these times I feel kind of crazy and stupid for letting this get to me, and I feel like I've wasted a long time hung up on that relationship.  It was a horrible habit to get into, and I really am looking for some advice about how to get out of it.  For a while I felt like it might be because I was depending on my ex to solve my self image issues, so I've started going to therapy for that.

129429,Non-Romantic,38jbu2,"My boyfriend works as a specialist for a government institution and is relatively new to his department. Some years before his arrival, his senior colleague ""Jane"" had a child and made it clear to the department head that motherhood was her first priority so she switched her work schedule to 30 hours per week. 

When my boyfriend started working at the department, he quickly noticed that Jane frequently called in sick every few weeks and often without advance notice. Consequently my boyfriend has to take over her workload during her absences and has noticed that her work is sloppy with little attention given. This is a serious issue as the cases they work on are sensitive and could be harmful to an individual if appropriate care isn't given. 

After speaking with the other specialists, he found out that Jane often takes sick days in order to spend more time with her child. This week, he informed me that we can't spend the weekend together because Jane's child is out of school tomorrow and told him she would be taking the day off which means my boyfriend has to stay behind and finish the tasks she wasn't able to complete.

As I've dated more and more in Los Angeles, I've realized that nearly everyone treats everyone else as an option. 

I'm a bit confounded here, because I just don't know how to develop a relationship with a woman anymore. Casual sex is almost trivial to obtain, but a real relationship seems nearly impossible. Everyone is always rescheduling, ""busy,"" or not interested into continuing to date because it ""doesn't feel right."" So, to combat this, I've tried to be as open and honest as possible, on time to dates, always trying to make time for women I like, etc. Nonetheless, I've been single for a year and a half. It was fun for a bit, but now it's just bewildering. 

This just happened: I scheduled an internet date with a woman a few weeks ago, and she claimed she had a migraine so she pushed the date off for two weeks (her family was visiting). Cool, fine. Tonight, after no contact for two weeks, she (obviously drunkenly) texts me to hang out at a bar with her and her friends. I decline, because I wanted to go on a actual date with this girl, but now I'm not sure if that is going to happen. What the fuck?

I'm smart, attractive, and funny/interesting (I think, I'm a doctoral student, have done some modeling, and people laugh at my jokes), so what gives? What am I doing wrong?

128572,Non-Romantic,3efbnd,"This isn't really a problem with my girlfriend. I'm not sure if there's another place on reddit to post this kind of question, but I'm not sure what to do.

Recently, my girlfriend's great uncle died and left all five other members of her family a great deal of money, while leaving her nothing. She doesn't come from a wealthy background, and no one knew how much money this relative had. She always knew it was likely that her three brothers would receive money, and not her, but the amount of money is utterly life-changing.

I'm not sure exactly how she feels. Even if she could articulate it, I'm not sure I would understand. I think there are a lot of other factors in her relationship with her family that contribute to what she is feeling:

1) She doesn't have a good relationship with her father. They basically haven't spoken in years. Her brothers have a better relationship with their father.

2) She's never had a good relationship with her great uncle. When she was a child, the man just stopped buying presents for her for Christmas and birthdays, but continued to get presents for her brothers. They lived across the street from them, and it was difficult for her to understand as a child. It sounds like there was no motivation for this, other than the fact that the man was extremely sexist.

3) Because her family has never had very much money, and wasn't expecting this, it seems like she feels as though all other members of her immediate family will be changed by this money and she'll be left behind. I think her family was a source of solidarity through the difficulty of having to be virtuous in the face of financial difficulty. She's made sacrifices in an attempt to achieve greater financial security. Her relationship with her family was better than what I have with my family (excepting her father), but now she feels like she doesn't want to speak with any of them. It's not that she resents them, but she doesn't know what to say.

4) She's the oldest. Her brothers will enjoy financial security at a difficult time in their lives, while she continues to endure difficulties related to being financially strapped in college and beyond. She feels like she had to bear the burden of interacting with her great uncle, but that he shunned her for some reason. There's never been any indication she came from an infidelitous relationship.

Then, there are these other things:

1) This event prompted her to vocalize the feeling she had about our lives. She doesn't like our house, our neighborhood, etc.

2) She seems to feel like she's making career sacrifices to stay with me at our house.

3) She seems to suffer from a variety of mental health issues. Our communication is not as healthy as it could be, and our relationship is not as strong as it could be. It's difficult to articulate what is wrong, but I guess I would characterize it as our fights escalate too much (never to the point of physical confrontation).

4) I don't have money, but I don't really care. I also don't have the kind of relationship she has with family or friends. I'm content to talk to noone but her for weeks on end while being consumed by my work and my hobbies. To be clear, I would be a very lonely person without her, but I don't really need other people. She feels isolated unless she has other friends around.

So I guess I'm asking, what do I do? How can I provide support? She's very upset and this event seems to have catalyzed other feelings about her life. 

I honestly think she's being melodramatic. I don't think we need money, but this amount of money would change our lives. She did get an amount of money sufficient to pay off her student loans, with some left over, but they weren't very substantial, because she received a lot of financial aid in college due to her situation. I'm pretty thick-skinned, so I don't necessarily mind her talking smack about our house and making passive-agressive comments about the sacrifices she believes she's making on my behalf.

I apologize for my disorganized thoughts. I guess my biggest question is: how can I help her through this, so she maintains what has otherwise been a good relationship with her mother and brothers? Has anyone else dealt with anything like this?

163728,Relationships,30obt5,"Hi r/relationships. Sorry in advance for the crazy long post.

Here's the deal....

Our families have lived 5 miles away from each other (where I live it's a very close distance) for 15 years. I've had feelings for their oldest [F18] for what seems like an eternity. I know this sounds borderline creep-like because of the small gap in age, but my family was always very nurturing with me, whereas her family has been very tough-love on her. Our maturity levels are on par with each other I would guess.

The stupid feelings sorta peaked in HS, when her best friend found out and told her without me knowing. [18F] fell REALLY hard for this dude [18M-crush] at the same time, so in her response, she outright told me she's never had feelings for anyone else other than him, despite the fact he has his own SO and can't tell the difference between flirting and being a ""best friend"". That was difficult to handle. :( We've since went back to being friends, but the feels remain even after we talked about it and put it behind us. But now whenever we're around each other, there's this mutual tension in the air like something's going to happen, and she doesn't want it at all.

To make this even MORE complicated, her family absolutely ADORES me. They go as far as to let me stay alone at their house and sleep in their master bedroom O_o, just so I can feed their horses, dogs, etc. while they are on vacations, family visits, or mission trips for weeks on end. (remember this is only 5 miles away) Our families have actually become so attached, that we consider their daughters to be our ""sisters"" and they consider my bros and I to be their ""brothers"" as neither of our families have opposite sex children. It's not some weird metaphorical religious junk or anything, despite the fact both of our families are. However, it definitely makes me feel like I'm outside the bounds of having a relationship with her, or wrong for even feeling that way. :( Plus, her dad has always been the fun and energetic engineer nerd-type, but he's now super outgoing about being protective of his daughters. (their middle child just began her own relationship....)

SO ANYWAYS, here's the current situation.

This year I transferred from local CC to a uni in a relatively large city for an art degree. Turns out, [18F] goes to a different art college in the same city, but can't afford high rise apartment costs. To solve this, her parents bought a house near downtown, so she can live there with art roomies next year and experience the sweet first tastes life on her own. It's been hard for her to make friends, and even though her parents have been pressuring her to mingle, she STILL leans on the younger (still in HS) crowd of friends, my attractive [19M] brother whom she doesn't have a crush on, and the other [18M-crush] dude she definitely still likes, even though he's STILL in his own steady courting-style relationship. &gt;:( She makes public and desperate attempts to get his attention. ""OMG [18M-crush] and sometimes his [16F-gf] are my besties!"" Of course she doesn't get any replies, and forgets all about my countless attempts at trying to comfort her during problems or cheer her up... Literally, I was the only person who showed up at her door for her 18th birthday, and HAND-CRAFTED gifts for both that and her graduation. But she still insisted the ""hi happy 18th"" text from [18M-crush] was the best gift ever, and tag-nagged him about it for DAYS. Guys, I am so close to being done.

Recently, she ashamedly revealed that she has anxiety problems, some medical issues, and her dad apparently called her out on her weight and linked it to her lack of friends... (she has been known to over-exaggerate, and I've been cautioned about liking her because of this. Her dad is NOT a jerk btw. coolest guy ever.)
I've been around and socialized with PLENTY of really nice girls at univ., but I can't see myself being in a relationship with anyone else than her. :(

It sucks, guys. It really does. And it has to change very soon, or else I have no idea what I'm going to do. I'll never be able to forget this phase of my life, and I know it'll haunt me if I sit on my ass.

ANY help is appreciated because this isn't about sex, and it's not about winning a prize, like a lot of other shit excuses to declare ""help I have a crush"" on this website. Upvotes, downvotes, I don't care. I'm speaking my mind and I have no one else to take it to. Thanks for the read.

TL;DR (smart choice lol): Myself, and my 8 year-long crush are now on the cusp of real adulthood, and I'm terrified for her. She's become very self-conscious and tries too hard to get attention. I trust the judgement of my go-to people to wait it out, but this is proving too long and too painful, with mixed emotions and signals all over the place.

Anyways, last semester, there was this girl I liked. She was my partner in my animation class and we became really good friends fairly quickly. We would hang out a lot and repeatedly went on dates. We were never officially together though. Right as winter break started, the night before she went out of town, she confessed that she liked me. I told her I liked her as well and we planned some dates for after she got back. We talked all the time when she was out and after she got back. Just a side note, a lot of the stuff she would send would be some very romantic (though non explicit) stuff

Now on the day of our date, she called me and told me she got called into work and couldnt make it, I completely understood that, after all it happens to the both of us. But since then she hasn't talked to me, at all. I tried messaging and calling to see if she would answer but nope, nothing at all. A day or so after that she unfollowed/unfriended/etc me on various social medias. When class started back up she would just stare at me, but wouldnt say anything at all beyond one word responses. About a week ago we started carrying on conversations again (when I have to interact with her) but not about what happened, and only in person.

So this week I am far away from home competing at the NCAA championships for my sport.  Before leaving, my girlfriend was crying and begging me to stay with her.  She is depressed/maybe suicidal and doesn't want to be alone.  In the end, I had to go to the bus and leave her crying In our room.

I got off the plane to receive a text saying she needed me, she'd probably kill herself this week, ""I hope you love this week of competition because you're losing me over this"".  We talked things through and got to a calmer place, and it ended with her begging me to fly home

Maybe I'm making it sound like she's all in the wrong, but I really don't know.  Walking out leaving her crying tore my heart apart.  And when I've been depressed in the past, she would always stay with me.  I think if our positions were switched she'd fly home to be with me.

Am I terrible for not being there for her?  Do this mean I ""love my sport more than her"", to use her words?  I think if I skipped this championship I'd be giving up my dream and regret it forever. I'm really feeling lost so any thoughts would be helpful, thanks guys.

We were far more than friends, but not officially dating or anything.

Summary: Long story short, she moved in with me after we became best friends when I spent a year out-of-state, she came back to live with me and my mother to go to school locally and save some money, since then I graduated and she has 1 year left. I was never really myself, the person she knew for the first year, because my mother and I don't have a good relationship and that strain on me was transposed onto her. I was a dick and and she deserved so much better and now she's gone.

She said I rely too much on her for her happiness, expect too much from her, and monopolize her free time. All true. 

I just went on a business trip out of town and finally came to this realization that it's my current environment that is causing me to be that way towards her.

Apparently things were way worse than I thought they were and it's too late to try to remedy them. I'm not the type of person to give up on something I care about, but trying just seems to make matters worse because she feels that I'm being overbearing.

As stated in the subject. I'm feeling a tremendous amount of guilt for dating my new girlfriend [26F]. We became official about 3 weeks ago. Roughly 4 months after me and my ex [23F] broke up. My new girlfriend is pretty cool. We have a lot in common, she's classy, and it feels like she's more mature. She came to me straight from her last relationship. Which was an on/off type of thing. She thinks i'm the best thing since pb&amp;j because I'm so easy going and just committed to her in order to avoid traumatizing her like her last boyfriend.


My ex on the other hand had one of the kindest most innocent hearts i've ever met. And for that reason I feel tremendous guilt about hurting her. And it can cause quite the conflict in my head. We broke up because of her tantrums. She would blow up and storm off over anything. But i think her attitude has a lot to do with the friends she keeps. They hate me and I dont like them. We come from a town where its a miracle if you go to college and graduate. I made it, and to top it off, dont have any kids at my age. Needless to say, there are a lot of haters, shit talkers, and bad company in general. I think the things her friends would chirp in her ears were really toxic to her and our relationship. I broke up with her largely because of the tantrums but also largely because of her social circle. Is this wrong? I saw her as the last link between me and a bunch of people that brought nothing but negativity in my life.


I guess i'm just looking for an objective opinion. All of my friends tell me there's no point in even thinking about my ex. What's done is done and they all think my new girlfriend makes me happy. I mean she does, but again, i can't get past this tremendous guilt i feel for hurting my ex. I can answer any questions if you want more details.

Throwaway, just because. This may be a long post. I apologize in advance. 


The first thing you have to know is that I (24F) broke up with my boyfriend (24M) of 3.5 years last week. The breakup was a good, mutual one, and we had been evaluating our relationship for the last year or so. We didn’t want to give up on something good, so we took our time, but decided we would ultimately be happier apart, as neither of us were getting what we most needed from eachother. I am already very happy and relieved to be by myself. I love him dearly and always will, but I was not getting what I needed from the relationship and feel much better I am honestly not heartbroken, though I am sad to have lost such an important/wonderful person.  



The second thing is that last may, I started working full-time in a dynamic office with many young people. I made quite a few dear friends, including one guy, that we’ll call Adam (32M). Adam and I hit it off, with same tastes in music, opinions on different matters (marriage, religion, where to live, children, etc). Adam and I didn’t pursue a relationship outside of work as I was in a relationship and he was engaged. We would talk at work, email a music recommendation once in a while, and that’s it.  When we would go out with work or be at the same conferences on the road, we would always end up talking for hours. He’s very great, and I had a tiny, healthy crush on him I think. A few months after we met, I learned that he had broken up with his fiancée. This didn’t really surprise anybody, because apparently she wasn’t very nice and he is a kind person.  


Anyway, all this to say that last week, after finding out I had broken up with my ex, he asked me for coffee (at McDonald’s, might I add). I figured he wanted to give me advice as he had gone through a big breakup earlier in the Fall. Turns out, this man broke up with his fiancée because he likes me. He apparently tells his friends and family, as crazy as it sounds, that he thinks I’m the one, he’s been trying to pursue relationship with other women since but can’t really invest himself with them as he has very strong feelings for me, he said he thinks I’m one of the only woman he ever met that could have the power to hurt him. Apparently, he even told his mom about me back in October. He’s been very respectful of the fact that i was in a relationship, and obviously didn’t do anything about it until he ‘’could’’. He also said he didn’t want to rush anything and that he wants me to take all the time in the world to be okay, but that I should know he’ll eventually ask me out on a date. He even mentions something along the line of even a year wouldn’t be too long. 


I realize that telling someone you’ve never been out on a date with that you think they are the one is a little crazy, but the scary thing is that it doesn’t really scare me at all. It doesn’t sound crazy, and I don’t have trouble imagining, too. He seems to be everything I’m hoping for in a partner. 


Has something like this ever happenned to you? Is it possible that I haven’t fully realized until now how amazing he is because I was trying to be loyal to my ex? I’m interested in him, but maybe now is not the right time because I still have a few things to figure out before going into another relationship, but how should I go about it as slowly as possible as to not hurt him if ever I’m wrong about how I feel? How do people even go about dating these days? I don’t want to screw this up because he is truly great (and very sexy!) and I’m very very smitten, but I also don’t want him to be my rebound.

Around half a year ago I moved to a different state for a temporary contract position, and did not know anyone in that state so I basically had no friends in the beginning. After a few weeks, I went to a company organized event and basically met a group of really nice people and the coworker in question, who we'll call Alex. I was integrated into their group fairly quickly after that event, and was very grateful for that as I pretty much hadn't been able to form many friendships since arriving. Everyone in this group works at the same company, so we pretty much eat lunch together every day and also hang out over the weekend and plan events together. 

Most of the people in the group are in long term relationships or married, and they have all known each other for a few years so they are very close. I did think that Alex was attractive when I first met him and he looked closer to my age, so I was definitely surprised when I found out he was actually 33 and had been dating his wife for 11 years, married for 3. For the past few months since I've joined this group, I've become tremendously happier - with my job, the city, and just life in general as I actually have friends now and look forward to hanging out with them. Last weekend some of us went to Alex's house (he lives with his wife, no children) just to hang out and have a few drinks. We ended up staying pretty late, so his wife went to sleep first. At this point there was only 4 of us left, so we decided to stream a movie on his TV. The movie got pretty boring and I got hungry, so Alex offered to walk with me to a nearby pizza place to grab a quick bite. 

We were both pretty tipsy at this point, and while walking there kept bumping into each other (which was kind of intentional to be honest), and after a bit he kind of slipped his hand over mine and we started holding hands. We talked about some random trivial stuff for the 10 minute walk there, but kept holding hands the whole time. After getting to the pizza place I was the only one that ordered so I started eating the pizza with both hands, and he kept his hand on my bare mid thigh (I was wearing a skirt) during the whole time, but he never tried to go under my skirt or move lower. However, I could definitely feel the sexual tension between us. 

During the walk back we started holding hands again, but this time he told me straight up that he liked me. That he likes me more than a friend. So I asked him What about your wife?. He told me that he fell out of love with his wife for some time now, and that during his 11 year relationship with her he has never liked another girl before until me. I was kind of speechless, and really didn't know what to say so I kind of just didn't say much and I don't even remember what exactly I did say, I just kind of steered the topic away but we kept holding hands. When we got back to his place he told me not to tell anyone, and I said of course I wouldn't, and he pulled me close in a way that felt like he wanted to kiss me, but I turned it into just a hug. We said we would talk about this later and went back inside to our friends, chilled for a bit more and I went home without any further incidents. 

For the past week I've kind of been avoiding any alone time with him, but I know that we should have a proper talk after what happened so it will probably happen sometime in the next few days. So here I am now, desperately seeking help because I really really like this group of friends I've made, and I don't know how I should proceed next ...

My contract ends in a few months, but theres a high possibility that it will get renewed which could lead into a full time position, so I might eventually end up living here permanently as I really like my job and the area. Other than that 1 time, absolutely nothing has happened between us through any forms of communication, but I know that even that 1 time was too much for someone who's married. I do find him attractive but I realize how wrong this is, so I want to get it across that I only want to stay friends with Alex. I'm just kind of scared of losing the group of friends that I've met here. 

During the talk with him, how should I say that I kind of regret what happened the other week, but that I still want to stay good friends and only friends? Also, I know this might be selfish of me but I really don't want to tell anyone else about what happened because if the group found out, I'm pretty sure it would never be the same again. I kind of want to treat this like a one-off situation, but from reading the many posts on r/relationships during the past few months about cheating, everytime the OP is encouraged to tell the actual SO of the person. I don't have any idea how I could even begin that conversation... after reading those posts especially, I used to think that stuff would never happen to me... yet here I am. I've never been attracted to anyone more than a few years older than me, so this situation is honestly kind of unexpected. Sorry this turned out longer than I thought it would.. but what should I do?

105530,Non-Romantic,32vis6,"I'm in my sophomore year at college living in an on-campus apartment with four other housemates. It's me, my roommate Jane, and the two roommates upstairs, Alice and Kendall. 

Housework has been an ongoing issue since we moved in. We originally had another roommate last semester, Emma, who did a lot to keep the house tidy since it was something she enjoyed doing, i.e. taking out the trash, doing dishes if they are left in the sink, sweeping, cleaning the rug, wiping down surfaces, etc. This is not to say that I or anyone else didn't do those things, but she was quick to leap on them.

Since she's transferred, however, I've noticed more things being left around and slacked on with no one but me seeming to give a shit. The trash in the kitchen will be left piling up, and when I say I am the ONLY one that ever takes the trash out, it's true. Everyone else simply ignores it and puts a new trash bag next to the bin. No one wipes down surfaces, picks up after parties, or keeps the stove top clean but me. It's kind of infuriating. We also have a house rule that you must wash your dishes within 24 hours that you make them, something we implemented after people were letting their dishes pile in the sink for days on end and not cleaning them.

The upstairs roommate, Kendall, is the worst at remembering this rule, and will often claim she forgets which dishes are hers so she does not wash them. I've always picked up other people's slack when it comes to dishes (reluctantly) because if I don't do them, they never get done. A few days ago my roommate Jane in the group chat asked that someone wash whoever's pot of pasta (Kendall's) that had been left in the sink since Saturday afternoon. Kendall responded back that it was hers and it had only been left for two days, and when I reminded her of the 24 hour rule, she said that she did other people's dishes on Friday so she's not the only one who's slacking. While this is true, this is the ONLY time I've ever seen her do someone elses dishes without being asked. She's very sensitive about the subject for whatever reason, although she is the person in the house who cooks the most/uses the most dishware.

So fast forward to today, there are many cups/mugs that have been sitting in the sink for a few days. They are not mine, since I only drink water out of a water bottle, and Jane is very good about keeping up with her dishes. The only explanation is Alice and Kendall, who both drink lots of liquids (juice, milk, etc.), so I decided to send a group text since I didn't want the sink a mess for when my boyfriend came and visited. This is what I sent, verbatim: ""Hi friends! Hope you're all having a good Thursday night. I just wanted to ask that whoever used all of those cups in the sink please wash them sooner rather than later, they've been sitting for a few days and will make the sink smell if they sit there any longer. It would be hugely appreciated!!""

No one responded, but I ran it by Jane and she said it was fine. I believe it was Alice who came home and washed them, but didn't say anything to me about it. A half hour later Kendall comes into our room and says while kind of laughing, ""Why was your text so formal?"" I responded that I didn't know and I was just trying to be nice. She told me, while still laughing, that it made me sound like an asshole. I was a little shocked because I didn't think that's how it came off at all, and I purposefully tried to be polite so no one took it the wrong way. Jane even defended me and said that she didn't think it was too formal or rude. Kendall told me she knew I wasn't an asshole though and changed the subject, asking if we wanted cinnamon buns. I was still hurt and said, ""Yeah, unless I'm too much of an asshole,"" to which she gave me a look, but she was smiling. It was weird, like she knew what she said upset me and thought it was funny.

I want to ask if I was being rude and how I could've said anything differently, or if Kendall is just being sensitive. Or am I being sensitive? She is depressed at the moment and could be taking out her anger and sadness on me, and also has been notorious for not having a filter. Should I let her know that what she said hurt me? If so, how? And how do I bring up issues with dishes again without being told I'm an asshole?

42559,Breakups,1ynxmm,"For two years we dated each other starting at the beginning of high school. Our relationship had been going very well. We tried to get every minute we could get with eachother, spending every day after school together. We would meet up every passing period and chat a little, kiss, then head off to class. Life appeared to be happy between us until about 6 months ago when she began accusing me of hitting on her best friend. We didn't have the same lunch periods, so I spent lunch with her best friend. She thought I was hitting on her during that time because she wasn't there to monitor it. Eventually she began hating her best friend then ended up breaking with me.

We remained friends after the breakup, though, because she openly admitted to still loving me and I loved her. Nothing had changed in our relationship other than the fact that we were technically free. She still wanted to kiss me, hug me, and spend every ounce of time she had with me. In December, we started to toy around with the idea of dating again. She was dropping hints left and right to get me to ask her out. I ultimately failed and didn't ask her out that month.

During winter break, her and I with two other friends began playing online games a lot. We all group chatted on Skype nearly every day while playing games. She apparently began to grow feelings for one of my good friends due to chatting so much. This wasn't an issue at first, but began to become more noticeable after school had begun again. During passing periods, this guy would try to be with us. He joined us during lunch, and was trying to do everything he could do to get close to her. She started to ignore me more and give more time to him. I talked to her some about this but she just said it was nothing, so I believed her.

About four weeks ago we went on a date. I bought her lunch then walked around a mall. She tried on clothing for me and eventually we took it around a corner. We french kissed about 5 or 6 times and were having a blast. As the end was drawing near, I finally built up the courage to ask her to be my girlfriend again. Sadly, she told me no for some reason. She told me she wasn't ready for a relationship but also told me that she'd tell me when she was ready so I could go for her first.

About three weeks ago is when everything began to really go down hill. She started to demand changes in our relationship suddenly. She was using the fact that we were technically single to justify her actions. Instead of spending every day after school with me only, she demanded that she gets three days with me and two with him. She also requested for us to Skype less so she could Skype him more. I was extremely hurt by these requests and told her no because I found them unfair. It sounded like she was just trying to play us both. I told her that it was unacceptable, and that she could only have one of us. She decided to go with him, so I stopped communication with her.

These past two weeks we have been arguing back and forth about how she thinks I should accept that she is going to be with him. I told her that I won't play her game and what she is doing is wrong. She claims she has been breaking down lately because I'm not there for her any more.

Finally, last night was the last straw. She kept telling me she needed me and that she was nothing with me. She told me that she just recently realized her love for me, and that she doesn't love him. Claiming to only like him, but love me, she still told me she can't hurt him after all she has started. She told me that one day she will return to me and be mine because I am her true love and the only one for her. To add salt to the wound, she told me that he had kissed her. It shocked her, but she said that it didn't bother her. She makes all these claims that she isn't dating him, yet she has kissed him twice and holds his arm in her arm. I don't know whether I should believe her or not. I finally said goodbye for the last time earlier today, and she ended it with telling me that she loves me.

Should I trust her? Should I wait for her? Should I ever return to her, or let her return to me? Even though we technically haven't been dating for awhile, we acted like we were a couple and everyone thought we were. We were closer than anyone else and did everything that a dating couple would do, so I believed that we were still dating. Three weeks ago is when we truly broke up for the first time. She apparently broke it off with me then turned around and kissed my good friend. Needless to say, I'm no longer his friend due to feeling he betrayed me. 

I just need some advice on how to accept everything and move on. Is it wrong that she tells me that she loves me and one day will be with me again, yet prefers to continue with a new guy? Is it wrong of me to tell her goodbye for the last time? I still love her tremendously, but these past three weeks have been the hardest in my life.

My friend (let's call her Ana [20F]) was leaving to go live in France for a year and be a nanny.  I found out I had a class with her boyfriend and I was relieved to know someone in a class because it was my first year at college.   At first I was determined to just be friends with him, because he was Ana's first boyfriend and the guy she lost her virginity to.  They only dated for about 3 or 4 months when she left.  About two weeks after she left Ben asked me if I would like to date him, I knew it was wrong but I really liked the guy.  When we told her a little while later she was very obviously not ok with it.  After she got over the fact that we would be dating she told me that she still wanted to be some sort of friends with me but wanted nothing to do with Ben.

I talked to her off and on for a couple months after that.  She would calls me regularly to talk, and make me feel shitty for dating her ex.  I took it because I still felt bad, but I wasn't going to break up with him because she couldn't handle it.  One day she was bashing on my boyfriend like she usually did, when I just didn't want to hear it any more I had been dating Ben for about three months then when I stopped talking to her, it was even his advice that I shouldn't talk with her.

It bugged me but I let it go.  Then yesterday he told me that him and Ana were going to go get coffee together and talk about her time in France and what he's been doing this past year.   I am not ok with him going to see her, but when I make my feelings known on the matter he just tells me that I am way overreacting.  He makes me feel guilty for not wanting him to go get coffee with her.  I would be more ok with it if she had tried to talk to me at all.

16182,Relationships,1lciv8,"Hi /r/relationships!

My relationship with my SO is very complicated.  We’ve gone through many rough patches but right now we’re back on track.  

When I first met my boyfriend, he was an amazing, sweet, and caring person.  I instantly fell in love with him and our entire relationship moved very quickly.  About a year into our relationship, my SO started abusing alcohol and drugs because of stress caused by the death of a close family member.  Unfortunately this abuse took a huge toll on our relationship and he began to take me for granted, mistreat me, etc. I didn’t want to give up on our relationship because I loved him so much but after 2 years of me begging him to quit for me, I couldn’t take it anymore.  I left him and he was a mess.  A couple months later, he contacted me to let me know that he had gotten clean and he begged me for a second chance.  I cautiously let him back into my life and he proved to me that he deserved my love and still loved me more than anything in the world  We’ve been together ever since.

Now that he's sober, he always treats me with respect, consideration and love.  Sometimes he’s a little over-considerate but I find that incredibly cute!  He’s been an extremely good boyfriend and I know he’s the guy I’m going to spend the rest of my life with. 

There is one issue though.  He says that he can’t propose to me until he forgives himself for the 2 years of hell he put me through.  He wants me to punish him or do something to help him move past this but I have no idea what I should do.  I don’t want to punish him!  I tried telling him he’s already made it back up to me by being the man I fell in love with but he’s still very guilty.  He never physically abused me or anything but sometimes he would say very hurtful things while he was drunk.  

For context: he brought this issue up when we were talking about our future together.  He told me there was something that he didn't want to burden me with but I promised him that I lighten whatever burden he was carrying.  He was very reluctant to tell me because he thinks he's making his problems my problems again but I genuinely want to help him move past this.  I keep on reminding him that I've completely forgiven him but it's just not enough for him.

Next week we’re going to celebrate 3 years of sobriety for him and he really wants me to give him his “punishment” then.  We both don’t know what he expects but he tells me that he hates himself for hurting me for so long.  I know this has been hanging over his head for a long time (I never bring it up because I know it’s a touchy subject) and I think he needs the closure but I don’t know what to tell him.

He became a bit depressed, started going out with his friends four times a week and not bringing me along, spent a ridiculous amount of money on going out, started being interested in pot although I'm deathly allergic to it, and also developed feelings for a girl he works with (and refused to let us meet when I became suspicious).

About 3 months ago we progressed from him sleeping over 3 nights or so a week to him sleeping over every night. At this point he has a closet of clothes, buys groceries with me weekly, and has a plethora of other things he has moved in (weights, equipment, etc) We never really talked about him moving in so rent hasn't come up. 

Tonight I asked him about it because my lease is running out in August and I'm starting to look at new houses. we had talked before about finding something close to downtown and with the way things are going i thought we were on track to live together officially.

1.) he does not have money for rent
2.) he does not want to spend money on rent
3.) he's concerned about committing to a year long lease

95161,Relationships,1nlgty,"So here goes my story. We've been going out for about two and a half years now and recently she's been going to therapy for depression. We now fight almost once a week now over our relationship. It's usually about how I'm never in the mood for sex or I don't have any time for her. 

This I  can understand. I'm a busy college student with fraternity duties, two jobs, and classes all going at the same time. My life is stressing me out right now and I can't relax, hence why I don't want to have sex. She's already aware of this since I've told her many times. 

Meanwhile, she seems to withdraw from me now since I'm too busy currently to be her emotional rock. It now feels like she doesn't want to be with me anymore. I asked her a couple of days ago if she still loves me and she said that she doesn't even know anymore. 

I'm stuck. I don't know what to do anymore and I'm out of people to turn to who won't already be biased to our situation.

52247,Non-Romantic,2s0f3n,"The female in question is 22, I’m a few years older. Over the course of 16 months, we have dated several times with varying degrees of success. At the moment, our relationship between one another is friendly, but not romantic. These issues I’m experiencing have always existed. All of the below refers to online/text communication or phone calls (not face-to-face interactions, which fortunately – we have always excelled at).


* I can count on one hand the amount of times she has instigated conversation.


* It is rare for a conversation to flow, or come to a natural end.


* She appears incapable of making a simple decision. Despite my gentle encouragement and willingness to involve her in how we spend our time together, I must always decide the meeting place and time. Suggesting several options and asking her opinion results in the usual “What do you think?”


* Therefore, I must present solid plans (e.g. *See you at X, at XX:XX*). Otherwise, nothing will come to fruition.
I often confirm with her on the day of meeting that she is still able to meet, as on one occasion she assumed I had cancelled because I didn’t message her for a couple of days.


* On some occasions; I have contacted her a few hours before meeting, and she has told me she cannot make it anymore. She has never taken the initiative and contacted me first in order to cancel. Often, I have been almost out the door to meet her.


Initially, I assumed she was disinterested (as many of you would assume, I’m sure). I found her behavior *extremely* rude. I quickly expressed my concern and explained to her my reasoning for why we should part ways as plain as day – I felt no regret.


Over the course of the next few months; she explained she is badly organized, suffers from dyslexia and is only comfortable with men taking the lead. I also learnt that her previous boyfriend was extremely controlling. I have always been in two minds whether she was being truthful, even to this day. Whenever I’ve offered to speak to her about these points, she has always refused and shot me down. Every time I’ve highlighted my issues, she has expressed remorse and has apologized – yet, improvements only last a fortnight, at best. For the full duration of knowing her, she has always said she is interested in me. I cannot fathom how she can act this way to somebody she apparently likes so much?


I’m still, to this day, 16 months on – experiencing extreme frustration due to her lack of ability to communicate. I’m sure that every reader is questioning why I haven’t simply cut her out of my life already: the reason being is that when we do interact face-to-face, there is great chemistry and it tends to take precedent – but maybe not for much longer.


I’m really interested in hearing people’s thoughts. Thanks.

I met girl A 1,5 week ago, we clicked really well and we agreed to go on a date the 20th. for her this was real full on dating, which meant that I wasn't to date other girls. we got into an argument about it(a few days after I met girl B) and both got over it and agreed that neither of us would date anyone else until the first date. (maybe thats oddly early but whatever)


a few days after I met girl A I met another girl with whom I clicked as well!, lets call her girl B. she and I agreed to meet because fuck it why not. we met and really liked eachother. at a certain point we were sitting next to eachother holding hands and just all round being intimate.


she started tickling me and i started tickling her and we ended up on top of eachother, and then it just felt so natural that I kissed her (I had never even kissed a girl up until this point, long story) we started kissing more and started touching more. at a certain point she started touching my penis and i touched her vagina and at that point i started feeling uncomfortable with how far we were going(without being in love). and I stopped her, and sent her home.
we met a day later for a movie and kissed again.(I still feel shit about it)


now here comes the real problem. I want to date girl A but I ofc need to tell her about this. I'm ready to cut contact with girl B if that is what it takes. I won't like it but if thats what it takes.


I have a date with Girl A on friday the 20th but do I tell her what I've done before or after the date? I kinda wanna tell her before since if we kiss on the date then she might feel used.(she really made it clear that she wants to kiss on the date)

However.  

There's a few things that have been hanging over my head about him that I'm not sure how to approach. Of course I plan to talk to him about said things very soon, but I'd like your opinions on the things:  

* He knows some pretty, err, strange people - mainly girls - I'm not really comfortable with. Of course I can't control who he hangs out with, but seeing he liked a photo on Instagram of some girls he knows lifting their shirts up and showing their tits, I can't help but feel slimy and irritated. I have plenty of other examples I've seen of girls he's friends with, such as one friend calling him cutie and my babe (inquire for more info if wanted) and saying braces are really attractive when he said he was getting braces.  
* These three things are related to his living situations:  
1) He lives with his best female friend [20F] and her two friends whom I am fine with - except he never asked me if I was okay with that. He just went ahead with it, and that bothers me.  
2) He suggested to a female friend that he used to have feelings for (presumably before I met him) and asked out (but she turned him down) that they could room together next year if she needs a roommate. No fucking thanks.. that couldn't turn out well.  
3) Me and him living together in the fall term has been brought up, but he gets anxious over if something were to happen. By the time we'd move in we will be at over 2 and a half years - well enough time, in my opinion. I'm tired of hauling a duffel bag over to his place every weekend and we've already seen that we mesh well together in an apartment situation. If he isn't comfortable with it yet that's that, but I can't help but feel insulted. I don't know. Help, guys.

95351,Breakups,2mxy6v,"Two weeks ago, I ended things with my SO of about 6 months because we wanted different things from the relationship and could not reconcile the two. He is a good man and things did not end messily. I am doing no contact right now.

Even though I am the one to officially end things, it has been really hard for me. My feelings, which were growing fast, have not gone away at all. I still really care about him. He was my first real relationship, which probably does not help.

He was wonderful in so many ways, a total catch. He understood my quirky sense of humor, we could talk about anything, we were like best friends.  Also, physically, he was exactly my type and he is as successful as me in our chosen field. It just seemed like a perfect match. 

It made sense to me why I had never really fallen for anyone else before-few people are going to match up so well. Few people would be this great. Part of my knows that I am likely romaticising what we had now-obviously us wanting different things is a pretty big incompatibility.

64335,Relationships,38u3q6,"I apologize for grammar and all that jazz in advance. I'm not the best writer and when I'm stressed my thoughts just go every where. Thanks for reading :)

So I met this girl last year online while playing a video game. We didn't really talk much until one time she messaged me when I was in a really vulnerable state (I think I was stressed about upcoming exams). So we start talking and we basically share our life stories with each other (I don't support gaining someones trust by telling them intimate details about yourself, and I really don't know why I told her everything about me). 

After we had our conversation we started to talk everyday. Mostly just about things that we were doing and just getting to know each other better. I started to develop feelings towards her because I felt like she is the first person that I could really talk to and not feel like I was being judged. I knew at this point I probably should've just started to distance myself from her because I knew she had a boyfriend (6 or 7 years together) and didn't want to end up getting hurt or hurting her. But I kept in the relationship. 

There were arguments between the two of us, caused almost always by her (we talked about this earlier this week, and she said she regrets how poorly she has treated me in the past). These arguments would make me feel unappreciated and we wouldn't talk for at least a week. When we did talk I felt more like a boyfriend then her friend. She would rely on me to calm her down when she was stressed out and would do the same for me.  She would do this even when her boyfriend was just in the next room, but she didn't feel like he was there for her emotionally.

After getting stressed out about being there for her emotionally but being frustrated because whenever we would argue she would just tell me she had her boyfriend to fall back on, basically reminding me I had no one but her (this has changed, I have developed more relationships with friends around me). So I decided March of this year I would stop talking to her. She really didn't say anything to me at first but after 2 weeks she finally asked me why I wasn't saying anything to her recently. And I just told her that I liked her (I didn't tell her how I couldn't deal with her being with her boyfriend), and I didn't feel like I was being treated well and I didn't want to talk to her for a while. (I was hoping that I would stop liking her and we could just be friends)

So we stopped talking, she would text me just to say hey every once in a while but her most recent hey led to me thinking about her constantly (not that I didn't think about her everyday already, but the last time she talked to me made her always on my mind). So we had a long talk about weather I felt I could talk to her again(she was crying the whole time because how much she missed me), and I took a day to decide (because I really can't just sit on something for long, plus I pretty much had my mind made up). Because before we even started to have regular conversations, I could feel myself going back to my old habits with her, always thinking about her, hating she was with her boyfriend, and just causing myself stress I didn't need.

I called her on skype and told her that I couldn't do this now and needed more time. At this point I really don't have any more emotions for her except that I deeply care about her (I may love her? idk tho). The whole time I told her this she was dead silent, then she just said I can't do this. She then hung up skype and I messaged her saying I was sorry and I just can't do this right now and I need more time. Wasn't good for her, told me I didn't understand why this was so hard for her too. Asked her why, she told me Cause I like you too. I said fuck to myself. I knew at that point I wasn't going to stop talking to her. So after her telling me to just tell her to fuck off and block her on everything and me telling her I would never do that. I said lets just talk a few times a week and see how it goes. She said ok reluctantly. 

So after we set this up I waited a few days and texted her. Just generic shit, hows your day, weather, blah blah. Shit went well for one day, but I could still feel myself getting back into the old trends (wanting her to just text me, just thinking about her being with her boyfriend (both sexually and not; this really got to me), and just making myself worry for no reason). The next day we were texting we started talking about blowjobs (something about an emoji looking like it was sucking dick... idk). But so blowjobs, she made a joke about me giving blowjobs and then I told her that was her job, and all it reminded me of was that she would never be 'mine', and I just pictured a mental image of her and her boyfriend(caused me to feel sad). I told her I didn't want to joke about this stuff. She just said it was a joke, but ill talk to you later.

After that we haven't texted since (been 2 days). I don't think I want this relationship to continue because of all the stress it puts under me, I don't want to get back into the cycle of her taking me for granted, and knowing that she'll never be in my life the way I want her to be. I have no more emotions to give towards this because of how she has made me feel in the past (I was trying to tell her sorry when I did nothing wrong (I'm not delusional I did nothing wrong and she has told me I didn't do anything wrong in this situation just her over reacting) and she just made a joke out of me being sorry when I was crying in a lecture hall eating pancakes at 3 am.) I just want to try and make this as painless, which I know isn't going to happen, for her. I already made up my mind that I am going to block her from everything, but I don't know what to say really.

I guess that's why am wrote this up. I want to know what you guys think I should do. I'm really lost and I think the sooner I get over this girl the more I'll be able to enjoy this summer and be able to trust people again (always had trust issues, she's just made them worse).

65169,Infidelity,2tuza7,"I've been with my GF for about 1.5 years now. I love her to pieces and we've talked about marriage. Sure we get in our occasional fights and struggle at times, but we have made it through most of our tough times. 

The problem is that I have wanted to cheat for a while. Although I love my GF, I still have a trapped feeling from my relationship. I used to party a lot and hook up with a lot of girls, but now obviously I can't do that. She used to be that way to and I think a lot of our fights come out of being on our own for so long. I miss that part of being single, but my GF brings me so much more and is so good to me. I've talked to a lot of my friends in relationships about this and they get the same feeling. Some of acted on it and some have not.

On Saturday night I actually did cheat. I got drunk on Saturday night and fingered a girl on the dance floor and she blew me for about 2 seconds in the bathroom, before I figured out what I was doing was really wrong. Very classy.

I feel pretty horrible about the situation. I've been able to act pretty normal around my GF, but I started getting crazy anxiety at night. I woke up at 2 AM and 5 AM in panics. My GF is really concerned about my health. 

I know what I did was wrong. You don't have to berate me for it. Early on in our relationship, I did cheat before, however it was simply a hand job from an asian masseuse. It was a bit different since it was paid for and kind of like a service. I did tell my GF about this and although she was upset, she wasn't too angry. She was concerned that it would become a regular pattern, however she pretty much forgave me that day.

One year later I feel like I fucked up. I know she'll break up with me if I tell her about this - I don't want this too happen. I've definitely learned my lesson. I've had friends who have cheated (going all the way) and maintained their relationship by not telling their wives or girlfriends. They know it's wrong - but it happened. They don't want to fuck up their families with something like this.

For those who have cheated - how do you handle these situations? Does the anxiety go away? I've learned my lesson and promised myself to never do this again.

138584,Non-Romantic,2pult7,"About a year ago me and my best friend stopped talking. About 2 years ago I got a TBI which has radically disabled me, and he couldn't handle my disability I guess and wanted out. The last year we had been in contact, he was very rude and emotionally manipulative imo. He would threaten to never talk to me again over what seems to me like really small stuff. For example, one time I asked him to tell me what the movie he watched the night before was about, and he just ignored me and asked how things were going at inpatient (which I had told him REPEATEDLY I didn't want to talk about), so I responded that I didn't really want to talk about it and if he could please just talk about the movie. And he said if I wasn't going to talk about my day there was no point in being friends at all and that he'd block me on everything and never visit, and is that what I wanted? Because of this behavior it is probably healthy for me to stay in no-contact.

However, despite that he was the best friend I ever had, truly. I paint in my spare time and for the past month have been making him a really nice christmas present, which I just finished a few days ago. I have never not given him a present (maybe a good time to note he has never gotten me a present). The painting has a huge emotional significance to an important thing we have done together in our friendship. I'm thinking of sending the painting in the mail along with a card that says something along the lines of ""You have been an amazing friend to me. Have a very merry Christmas and a fun holiday season"". I'm afraid that will annoy him or something though, seeing as he doesn't really want to be in contact with me. If he wanted to be in contact with me, he'd unblock me right? On the other hand, if I give him a gift I'm hoping it'll maybe convince him to give me another chance.

7866,Relationships,26eynj,"Ok this is going to be way too long. I'll try to avoid coming off like a whiny pretentious neckbeard here, but it may happen anyway. Sorry for all that in advance.


We first got together about 8 years ago. Moved in together after 6 months, everything was perfect for the first 2 years. We moved for my job, which ended up being a year of hell as she couldn't find work and was very alone (no friends/family nearby) and my work life went down the tubes, I started drinking heavily and gained a lot of weight. (no worries i'm quite fit now) So after a year we moved back but we couldn't get back whatever it was we had lost. Things were better, but it seemed there was always something not quite right.


A few years back we broke up and she moved out, for many of the same reasons I'm struggling with now:


She is really an amazing person, pretty much everything you could want in a partner and would make a fantastic mother. She's beautiful, caring, extremely respectful of my personal space and freedom, our sex life is healthy. She's laid back, doesn't take herself too seriously, and is about as low-maintenance as they come. 

The problem is we have nothing in common. I'm a huge nerd. I spend most of my free time with my head in books or video games. She reads glossy magazines and watches reality tv. I don't even watch tv or films (I just don't have the attention span to sit still for that long usually) aside from a handful of exceptions, all if which were 'too weird' when i tried to share them with her. We've tried taking up several hobbies together but nothing has stuck.


Only having very different tastes wouldn't be a problem for me; I think one would go crazy if their partner was a carbon copy of oneself. It has more to do with how different our mentalities our, how we view the world. She's possibly the most risk-averse person I've ever met while I'm adventurous and always wanting to try new things even if they are self-destructive (and i have a history of self-destructive behaviour). She's down to earth but completely imaginationless, while i'm a flaky daydreamer who spends more time thinking about the abstract than the concrete.


I spent a year doing a lot of dating, searching for someone i could connect with and came to the apparent realisation that i was just an odd and isolated person and was going to feel alone in that sense for the rest of my life. Everyone I met was uninteresting and had nothing to say, and in fact, paled in comparison to my gf. No biggie, i like being alone anyway. I'll just have to get my intellectual stimulation from within.


We get back together. She was dating someone else but as soon as I mentioned to her I'd be willing to give it another shot she dropped him and came back to me. We moved back in together after about 6 months. All going swimmingly. Then of course in an fit of epic bad timing, she gets pregnant (not on purpose) and soon after i meet someone.


Now, this person that I met is/was a highly flawed individual, and we met online - never in person. (i am not the cheating type) But there was a such an incredible spark there in our conversations, I could spend hours waxing about how it felt to meet and connect with someone in a way i previously didn't think possible. I felt something long-dormant inside me coming back to life. It made me realise what I was missing. For a short time, I felt like i was really, truly falling in love.


We don't talk anymore now but during the time we did it awakened me to the reality that what I crave in a partner above all else is a mind-mate (if you subscribe to myers-briggs/keirsey psychological types), and now I'm about to have a baby with someone who is a great person and who I care very much about, but is just about the polar opposite to that. I feel like I'm going to spend the rest of my life with this horrible feeling of lonliness.


Now I've just written all that and I don't even know what kind of advice I am looking for. Maybe I just have no one to talk to about it and this is a 'tell it to the iron stove' moment.

28000,Relationships,1hr78m,"I'm currently in a 8 month relationship that is mutually seen as very serious and committed. We've spent the last two months somewhat long distance due to college summer break, having only seen each other once. While she doesn't do anything wrong, and many aspects of our relationship work well, she also seems to miss a lot of things that I consider crucial in a relationship, centering around an unfinished conversation we had last night.
---
Our relationship is very one-sided emotionally. She doesn't care to open up as much, doesn't necessarily attempt to help when I'm upset or I have a problem in my life, and doesn't necessarily seem to view me as her number one person to confide in. The conversation we had last night, which is the reason I'm writing this post, sums up all three.

 I told her that one of the reasons I loved this relationship so much was that I felt that she could do things and understand me in ways that other people couldn't; when she replied with what amounted to thank you, I asked her if she felt the same because that's the only thing I think is worth a commitment. She said that she didn't know. I asked her if we were in two different places, she said probably, and she asked if it was important. I told her that it was potentially a problem and she replied with You seem upset, so I'm going to go to bed. Night, love you. This is a recurring pattern when I either open up, have a problem, or want to have a serious discussion; while she wants to be in this relationship, she seems fine with having it without depth. At the same time, she has referred to me as a guy she could see herself marrying, so the mixed signals are confusing. I guess my question is two-fold, Reddit; what do I say to her in the morning, and how do I make her more invested in this relationship?

134363,Infidelity,3fp2p8,"This happened about a month ago, but I'm still dealing with it. My wife of 4 years (together for 9) basically slept with her good friend's boyfriend. She told me about it a few days later. 


Now our marriage was definitely not perfect. I had withdrawn emotionally and felt overburdened with depression. I was emotionally neglectful and I hold many regrets about my own behavior. I was honestly completely apathetic about most aspects of life. I only did what was absolutely necessary for survival and academic success. I accept these failures, although I do not blame myself for her infidelity. 


My wife apparently met this guy at a bar one night while out with friends. They exchanged numbers and began texting. Approximately one week later she went over to this guy's house and had sex with him. 


She told me about it a few days later and my world turned upside down. I didn't know how to react. I said some things that I regret, but I couldn't really help it at the time. 


My wife and I separated. She went to stay with a friend while I stayed in the house. She told me that she wanted to be alone and experience independence. I wasn't really open to the idea and expressed my concerns. She agreed to go to counseling and to work on our issues (we haven't gone to counseling due to financial and scheduling issues). I felt happy to know that she still cared enough to try. She came back home and we began to work things out. She also got checked for STD's. 


I ended up deciding I needed to be alone for a bit to think, so I went to a friend's house out of state. I stayed there for about a week. The problem is that I spent this entire time texting my wife and sexting. I couldn't wait to get home. 


I came home and we have basically been overloading each other with affection. Constantly texting, touching, and fucking. At a certain point I began to wonder if I was truly going to be able to get over her infidelity. I also began wondering if I could be happier with someone else. 


I expressed these concerns to her, probably foolishly, but I have never really hidden anything from her. She was definitely concerned.


Last night the ""other man"" texted her. She told me immediately, but I couldn't help but find myself ""triggered"". I suddenly felt depressed, angry, and disillusioned with our relationship. She handled it appropriately, but I was still upset. 


Today I decided that we need to separate. I feel I need to take the time to evaluate whether or not I truly want to be with her. I am constantly tortured with thoughts of and images of my wife with another man. I've been having legitimate nightmares about it. I am worried that my image of my wife is forever tarnished. She was capable of betraying me and one of her best friends because she wasn't happy. 


I'm just wondering if it makes sense for me to even try to reconcile. I don't want to wake up one day and realize that I've wasted another 15-20 years of my life. Has anyone actually survived infidelity? Does the fact that I'm wondering if I'd be happy with someone else mean that I should move on? Am I making a mistake by even considering reconciliation? Can I really trust a person who's able to betray me and her good friend? I'm worried that I'm only staying out of obligation to my wife and our 3 year old daughter. My wife does make me happy, but I wonder if I'd be happy with someone else.

Me and my boyfriend have been dating for 2.5 years. We have a good relationship and love spending time with each other. Last summer, I went travelling for 2 months with my family while my SO spent the summer at home. 2 months is a very long time for us to be apart so naturally we kept ourselves satisfied by sexting and sending each other pictures. 

My SO had gotten a new phone later, so the pictures of me were saved onto his old phone, which he now keeps beside his bed in a drawer. No sim card, basically unusable other than apps that only run on wifi. Not that I don't trust my boyfriend, but I am terrified of the thought of one day those photos getting out if we ever break up.

Last week my boyfriend left the room to go work out. I lock the door because I like to hang out in his room in underwear and one of his big t-shirts and I dont want any of his family members seeing me like that. So as you probably guessed, I went into his old phone and deleted the album of my scandalous pictures.... 

We have sex pretty often so I don't feel like he needs those pictures, but I know that I still went out of my way to delete them. And the fact that I did it in secret makes me feel guilty. I never told him I deleted the pictures.

We all went to high school and middle school together. Other Friends told me to date Jerko so I did as I was naiive and 12 years old. He raped me, beat me, stalked me, cut his name into his skin, and so forth for 2 years. He did the same to the girl he dated after, and the same to the girl he dated after that. I ended up moving, meeting Aladdin, and never looking back EXCEPT for keeping in contact with hometown friends. As far as I knew Jerko has a string of girls he continues to beat, and lives a few states from everyone I know including myself. 




Asuka and Shinji date forever and have a child and get married. Asuka is unable to be monogamous, so Shinji lets her open up their relationship. Enter Jesse aka Partner One. Jesse is fine by Shinji (the husband). So, Jesse moves in with Asuka and Shinji plus their child Rei. Again, all is well. I have my own happy marriage, they have their own happy poly-marriage. 




Jerko and Asuka start to talk on facebook. Now Jerko is busing to Asuka/Shinji/Jesse/Rei's house. Shinji IS NOT happy with this. Why? Jerko is violent, a rapist, manipulative, infamous for one-way trip tickets, and so forth. It isn't the person you want near you on the bus much less near you in the house with you and your child. You would think it ends there, right? Nope!




Shinji and Asuka's polyamory has no ground rules or dealbreakers as it hasn't been needed. Shinji can't tell Asuka to screw her head back on and that Jerko isn't allowed in the house. Why? Cause Asuka will take this as a personal attack and bring Jerko into the house when Shinji is at work. Asuka also plans on having sex with Jerko which is DEEPLY troubling to her husband Shinji as Jerko is not clean (i.e. STDS, HIV). Asuka and Jerko will not use a condom. From what I gathered from talking to Shinji the only boundary is not having Rei around Jerko. Oh, Jerko is into very young girls, has child porn, and so forth. 




So I don't know how to help them. I told Shinji to take Rei and just go to Asuka's grandmother's house while Jerko is there. That isn't possible. I told Shinji to stand up to Asuka and put his foot down, and he cannot do it as he is concerned it will break the marriage completely. Shinji also feels emotionally conflicted as he hates himself for being jealous and sickened by Asuka being touched by Jerko. 




I sit here in another state in my happy, non-abusive marriage. I still remember what Jerko did though. He is a very, very dangerous person. He will hurt my friends, and I don't want that to happen. I also feel bad for Shinji wanting to be able to talk to Asuka about this yet Asuka just refusing to listen, choosing to do the opposite of what Shinji wants and doing it behind his back anyway. 




The other thing, they have a kid. It isn't like my marriage which is childfree. You can't just grab Rei and take her wherever.... that's kidnapping and stuff. Is there anything that can be done for this? To make sure Asuka doesn't get hurt, and Shinji and Rei? I hoe Jerko gets hurt of course, maybe his bus crashes with him being the only fatality... 




I can give more info if needed. I tried to make this simple as it is so many years of history. Thanks. 




Oh and Jesse can't do anything. He is very passive and doesn't know how bad Jerko is as he is new to our social nexus.

96717,Relationships,2r7rgq,"My boyfriend and I have been dating for a year now. We have been completely open with each other regarding our sexualities, what we want in terms of sex, and our concerns. 

I'm not sure what kind of labels I should use, so if there are better terms to use please feel free to correct me.

I've always known he was bi-sexual. He's been open about his past experiences and honest with how having sex with men is something he is going to continue to do. He has never had a romantic/emotional/relationship with a man, it has been strictly sexual (a FWB situation.) This is something I'm more than fine with, and don't consider it cheating if I know about it prior. Perhaps it's a double standard, but I don't mind him having sex with another man, but having sex with another woman without me is off limits.

I've expressed the boundaries I need in order for it not to have an effect on our relationship. I want to know when he begins to initiate, know that he has taken the precautions of knowing the other guy is clean (test results, open dialogue,) and I want to know before it happens (I don't want to be surprised by this, as in receiving a text after it happened with no prior knowledge that it was going to happen.)

I've been concerned about these boundaries, as I don't want to be controlling. I want him to have these experiences for himself and if he wants to include me in a threesome or to watch, that's fine, but I fully support and encourage his need to do this alone. These boundaries may seem like I'm not ready to be in a relationship like this, but if it turns out that way, I will cut my losses because the last thing I want to do is restrict his sexuality.

With all of this being said, he has had some issues with my boundaries and I'm curious as to if I am being too expecting/restricting. I helped him find a guy that he might be interested in, and he had some private conversations with him. This is fine and acceptable, but a few days later I asked what was going on with them and he told me he stopped talking to him because he was no longer interested. He decided this a few days ago. I don't have an issue with him not being interested, but I definitely felt left out, which seems ridiculous in retrospect, but if I have to ask to be updated I'm afraid of how far he'll push these boundaries when something physical does happen. He says that he updates me as he sees fit, in that if something exciting or if there is actual news to report back, but in not keeping an open dialogue about this all, it feels like he is doing this behind my back. Irrational, I'm sure.

This is the third time it has happened though. He reconnected with someone he had hooked up with prior to me, and I encouraged him to meet up. I hadn't heard anything in a while, and on a Wednesday a few weeks ago I asked what was going on. He said that they made plans to meet up on Friday, but the guy has stopped talking to him since. They made those plans almost a week prior and I found out two days before they were supposed to meet only because I asked. 

He is also trying to organize a threesome with me and his female friend. They have had sex before which doesn't really bother me, but her messages with heart emojis and kissy faces makes me nervous. I wanted her and I to develop a friendship prior to the threesome so I can get a better feel for her, as I do have my reservations about her intent (another post in its entirety.) He said he'd give her my info and set something up, but I haven't heard anything since. I asked after a month of silence about it, but he simply says there is nothing to ""report back on.""

I've talked to him about this every time it happens and he apologizes profusely and says he'll be better. He says he's not doing anything behind my back and he wouldn't do anything to hurt our relationship.

With all of this being said, are my boundaries and expectations too controlling? Am I being irrational and trying to make this work when it is clear that an ""open"" relationship really isn't for me? If my boundaries are fine, should I expect this behavior to continue and intensify?

When telling his current gf, he somehow convinced her that he was an innocent victim just making a mistake- it was all heat of the moment. All of our friends know of his behavior. They know he cheated, they know he used to call me stupid constantly. They know he abandoned me several times when I needed him- including two miscarriages. He refused to wear condoms even when I insisted. He would constantly yell and make himself seem like he could do know wrong....

He made me feel worthless, trashy, and suicidal. My friends know this, but they continue to act like nothing has happened. They don't confront him or ask him about it. They invite him to all the same events they invite me to. I have told them that hearing about him makes me uncomfortable- but they continue to forget and talk about hanging out with him.

I'm not really sure what to do at this point. I love my friends, but it frustrates me that they continue to hang out with him. I know it's selfish to expect them to see him as the same snake I do. But they know he emotionally abused me. I'm not really sure where the grey area is here. It seems like they refuse to acknowledge what happened because there's no actual physical evidence like with normal physical abuse.

Since then my life has been better. My career is blasting off (kicking off would be an understatement), I'm no longer depressed, and for the first time in my life I've gotten a lot of attention in the dating realm. 

Recently I've begun hanging out with mutual friends associated with my ex and his gf, and the last time we all hung out, my ex and his gf were there. I was fine, if anything, it reinforced why I no longer talk to him. For the most part we ignored the presence of the other (except at the hang out we all got drunk and I talked to him and his gf to be cordial). 

However, I recognize that this may make things awkward for the mutual friends. So I've been considering having a grown - up conversation with my ex about acting normal around our friends.

Except for one thing that I just can not figure out. My husband is calm, mostly rational and a good guy, but every now and again I will do something that would just annoy someone else, but makes him super angry. Now, when I say super angry I mean HIS version of super angry which is to ignore me and then send me text messages that say marginally hurtful things.

He starts talking to me and I say shh and hold up my index finger (as in give me a minute) and he sighs all loud and sits down and pouts.

I feel bad because his farther passed away a few months ago, but he's been using it as an excuse to be a fuckup. He is very co-dependent with his mom; once he had promised me he would no longer drink, and his mom wanted to take him to dinner, which I was thought was a good thing. My relationship with my parents isn't good, they weren't good parents, whatever, I just thought it would be good for them to be together. She brought him home shitfaced, and apparently she was drunk, too. 







On Saturday, he worked at 5 and I worked at 4. We share a car, and I was told his mom was taking him out to go grocery shopping, which I was very grateful for, as I hadn't been having a few shitty shifts, had a doctor's appointment, new meds, and therefore I was low on money. Later that night, he was very mean to me out of the blue to the point where I wanted to cry. My manager later told me he sent him home because he was drunk. He and his mother went drinking BEFORE WORK instead of grocery shopping, and then he was drinking at work! My manager told me my bf is on his last strike. Today, I was finally off a day (to clean the apartment and do laundry), so I took my boyfriend to work. He wanted to stop at a liquor store 10 minutes before he had to be at work, which made me mad because I didn't want him to be late since he's kind of on thin ice, but he doesn't seem to care. He thinks he can't be fired. (My manager assured me it will definitely happen if he continues fucking up at work).









I sat him down yesterday and told him he drinks too much, he treats me like shit, and he's using his father's death (I know I'm not an angel, that was harsh, but it's true) to fuck up. I told him I wouldn't put up with it anymore. I wanted to give him a month to hopefully make an effort to get some help, start treating me okay, hell, at least show me he is TRYING.

I want more tattoos, he doesn't want me to get any. I have a goal for my life, and it feels like he's just talk. I'm in a lot of physical pain, and I realize it's probably because he's depressed about losing his father, but it feels like he doesn't give a flying fuck about how hard I'm working to try to take care of us, which in turn hurts my body worse, and if I want it clean, it's my responsibility to do our apartment that I'm paying for even though he has more days off, more time to do it, and no chronic pain.

140995,Non-Romantic,2jipvy,"So here's the story. My younger brother and his girlfriend have been dating and living together for 8 months now. They've been in the same circle of friends since high school. As far as I know they are each other's first significant others.


About three months into their relationship she got pregnant. Note both are still in school (undergrad) since both had issues with mental health, and they've gotten each other through that while both trying to finish school after staying for extra time to get their degrees. We had no idea about it until he told us about it.


He told me that they were freaking out... But then a few days later said they were excited to become parents and raise a child together. The doctors found out that it had been a month and a half at this point.


During this time our parents (living outside the country) were against keeping it since they didn't believe my brother and his girl were ready for a child (given the school situation, also neither have ever been employed). They said that by giving up the child today, they would be able to prepare themselves better for their children in the future. Me and my oldest brother agreed. So, few days later, they decided to go through with the abortion.


They visited my parents together, where girlfriend met them for the first time - and fought a lot (sometimes all through the night) and generally long story short, my parents don't really approve of their relationship. She also commented ""his parents made us get an abortion"" while at dinner with a close family friend, which my parents didn't really appreciate since it isn't true.


Now, my oldest brother is getting married to his high school sweetheart in our parents' country. My brother wants to bring his girl to the wedding - thing is, my parents want him to come alone, to help with wedding planning and also because our family is going to get to know the brides family on a week long vacation together. Also probably because they are wary of the relationship. This is hurtful to my brother and his girlfriend because she feels excluded from the family event, and my brother said he would refuse to attend, otherwise he would betray his girl and cause irreparable damage to his relationship with her.


This is really shocking to our family and both sides have really been hurt.


He later told me that my parents should take her more seriously since they went through the abortion due to my parents' advice. He wants them to accept her... And my parents say that they don't understand why he can't come to the wedding alone, especially since the bride's brother's long time girlfriend isn't invited either (five years relationship!). I also think that they do not accept her as family (at least not yet) so for them it's not a big deal not to invite her.


I am at a loss. My brother obviously loves his girl a lot, but I feel he should attend as a member of the family. I also don't side with either side... I am attending as well and it's really important for us to all be there, but I'm afraid if he chooses to not attend it will really become, symbolically, our family against them in their minds.
Is there any advice you might give in this situation?

I don't have exact proof that he went to see any of these women or have had sex with them. He denies anything other than talking to them. I love both of my parents, but they have terrible communication skills and fight a lot. I don't want my siblings to get hurt either. 

I don't really know what to do at this point. I'm thinking to buy a GPS tracker to have proof of where my dad is going or installing a key logger (something to record what he's typing). Another option is to tell my mom, but honestly I don't think I can physically do it. I know it's selfish, but I just can't. I can't imagine my family breaking apart.

171856,Dating,1ofcgm,"Ill try to keep this as brief and on topic as possible. In 2005 I met this girl on an online game. We became friendly and played together a lot. We became great friends and have stayed in touch from 2005 till now. I recently ended a long relationship and she did the same. 


We had joked about wanting to meet for a long time, and recently really started talking about visiting. We text and message pretty much everyday and it has even bumped into the ""flirty"" category if that exists. She refers to me as babe, lovey, hun, etc periodically and commonly send :* in messages. Maybe a friendly gesture maybe not?? The other day she sends me a picture of a plane ticket to my Airport. Shes coming for a few days and will be staying with me. 


Should I assume this is a friendly visit or are we testing the waters? Im kind of unsure what to think. I talked about going out to get a sofa bed for her to sleep on and she promptly responded that she would be sleeping in my bed, and I could sleep on the new sofa bed. We have been great friends since 2005 and talked with either through many sticky situation with relationships. We share a ton of common interests including bands, games, values, etc. Am I thinking into this too much? Ive asked a few close friends and their opinions are that a girl would not buy a ticket to visit someone she's never met without serious relationship motive. 


So -- What do I expect? I know the trip will go off without a hitch and we both will get along fine, but should I be prepared for more? A female perspective would be nice!!

6037,Relationships,3aqk92,"I'm so lost at this point. I need advice, I need to vent, I need reassurances. REALLY LONG 

When I first met my SO( let's call him John), we were both sort of just starting out in our careers. I want to say I went slow into the relationship, but I feel like I dove right in. We were online penpals for about a month before we started seeing each other in person (we lived about 1h30 away from each other). We slept together our second date. I only saw him once to twice a week but that didn't matter. Our communication was so strong we made it work. I felt really strongly about him.

A little over two years into our relationship, John wanted to move in together. My mom is very strict, and wanted us to get married before we moved in together. John didn't agree with that, saying that he wouldn't marry someone who he hadn't lived with yet. I urged him to talk to her, and he wouldn't, saying that I needed to take care of it. He tried breaking up with me one night because I wasn't standing up to my mom, and the next day felt bad and took me out to dinner and we worked things out. I went looking at apartments with him, told my mom I was moving out, and became disowned for about six months. It was a really horrible time. I didn't realize how not having my family around would affect me. It happened around the holiday season. I can't listen to Christmas music without thinking of that period. 

Eventually, I patched things up with my mom. We were never really close, but it helped that we were civil again. Things with John were great, for the most part. He supported me through all of the stuff with my mom, and I really appreciated it. Last December he asked me to marry him, and it was a really special moment for us. It seemed like all was going right.

There were issues with our relationship, though. John drank a lot. John said he was stressed from work, and needed a drink to take the edge off. It was never just one drink, though. He would have about 3-6 drinks every night. He could finish a handle in a couple of days. He would sometimes act weirdly and make me uncomfortable, but I would take care of him and sort of just let it slide. 

He also gamed a lot. The drinking and gaming went hand in hand. He first only played games that he could get off of whenever he wanted, but soon moved back to raiding. He would raid from the moment he got back from work (4-5 pm) to sometimes later than he should be up (anywhere between 11-2). Consistently. I wouldn't even be able to talk to him while he gamed, as he would be on Vent or talking to his brother.

He started to become disinterested in me. I have an occupation that requires me to be social, and I always invited him to come out for drinks or hang out with me and my coworkers. My requests became smaller the longer we lived together - Let's go on vacation turned into let's go have a weekend out turned into let's go out and have date night into let's go on a hike(right outside our place is a trail) to let's go bike to the park to let's go to the gym. His excuses were, I don't want to come into the city, I don't like your coworkers (he's barely met them), we're saving money and can't afford to go out right now, I'm working long hours and can't do XYZ you get the picture... We were basically just, existing. Staying in and watching netflix was our new date night. we wouldn't even eat dinner together every night. I just became complacent and let it slide.

About 1-2 months ago, my pharmacy told me I had to go see a doctor to get my birth control prescription renewed. They didn't give me any warning, and the first time I could see my doctor was maybe two to three weeks from then. I went without my BC for about a month. During that time, I experienced all sorts of hormonal changes: the two most notable being that I started realizing how all of John's behaviors were not okay with me anymore. I didn't know if I could deal with the alcohol, the gaming, the complete disregard for wanting to hang out with me. 

The other thing that happened is I developed a crush on a coworker (Let's call him Jason). He was the exact opposite of John - athletic, not a gamer, not a huge drinker, was open to hanging out and doing things. I let myself get sucked into it. We had lunch together, stayed late at work to hang out with other people. One day I ended up telling Jason that I wasn't sure if I wanted to be married, and he told me that if I decided to leave, life wouldn't be so bad. I told him that I was becoming attracted to him, and he said he felt the same. We hung out and talked about what that meant for us. I told him I wanted to leave John. 

I told John I wanted out, and he became a wreck. He's not the one to cry, but he was sobbing every day, telling me he loved me and he would change. He told me he would stop drinking, stop gaming, would spend all his time with me. He wanted to work things out and go to therapy. I just felt numb to everything. I couldn't bring myself to want to make it work. I tried going to therapy once, and came out feeling really heavy. The therapist said there's something like five things you need to have in order to have a healthy relationship (something like trust, intimacy, respect, etc), and I didnt feel any of that. I felt like John could just be a good friend, but we couldn't work things out. 

I tried telling my family about what was going on, and they told me they wanted nothing to do with me. I was uninvited from my sister's wedding, then reinvited when they calmed down, but moved to a table with my sister's old school friends. It was shitty.

I was excited by jason. I wanted to be with him. He turned me on and I hadn't felt like that in a long time. I felt excited at the prospect of starting over. I made plans with another coworker to get a 2bd together. It seemed like everything was going well. I was staying at another coworker's place while I figured out what I wanted out of my relationship. I ended up having a date with Jason, and sleeping in his bed. No sex. I couldn't even look into his face because it made everything super real.

My work sort of suffered. I was telling my new boss what was happening, but I guess some of the higher ups had it out for me, and once they found someone more senior than myself, they let me go. I wrote Jason and let him know what happened, got in my car, and called John. I was sobbing. I loved working at that company, I loved my coworkers. I had a lot of people reach out to see how I was doing. There apparently was an uproar about my leaving. Anyway, I came home, and John comforted me. I noticed that the messages I was receiving from Jason didnt come through during my call, and he asked where I was and what I was going to do. 

I went home and told John I wanted to stay. I told him earlier that day (before being let go) that I was leaning towards staying, but I wasn't 100% there.  I told him I wanted to make things right. He told me that I would have to tell him everything about Jason. He had read previous chats, and we would just move to another medium. I finally showed him everything. He knew about sleeping over, he knew that I had sent him scandalous photos, he knew I wanted to hang out with him later that week.  He forgave all of that because he wanted to be with me. He made me delete my twitter, he made me delete Jason's phone number. I had to write him and tell him that i loved John and wanted him out of my life. It was really painful to do all of this. i feel like i resent him for it.

That all happened wednesday. Today I told him I'm still unsure, and he said he needed me to decide because he gave up a room at his friend's place because i said i was staying. I told him i felt pushed to be with him because who is going to rent a room to an unemployed woman with TWO cats. I also told him that I needed time to decide. We don't have a lot of time. We have to tell the leasing office by the 30th if we're staying in our apartment or not.

I have no idea what I'm doing. I have no job, no support from my family, might not even have a relationship if I choose to go, will not have a place to stay if I can't find a job. I know that what I did is considered cheating, at least emotionally.  I can't feel love right now. Like, I'm not in love. I care about John deeply, but I dont know if he's the one for me. He says we can get therapy and work on things, and I know he really wants to change. I'm not claiming to be a saint. I just need advice.

My boyfriend is always telling me about girls that are hitting on him despite knowing that he's in a relationship. For instance, a girl he's interviewing was flirting with him, and when he told her he's in a relationship, she responded to say that she loves the thrill of teasing taken men. Wat. Who says that?


The reason he brought it up is that I think they'd hire her if I'm comfortable with it, and then he'd interact with her on a regular basis. I don't think he'd make up these stories to make me jealous, and I say that because one time I was playfully going through his phone, and I saw things to indicate that that kind of thing does happen to him. I'm just trying to wrap my head around the fact that he knows so many girls for whom this is normal behaviour. What is this? It's actually messing with my perception of humanity. (I'm neither naive nor is this my first relationship.)


Another thing that concerns me is the way he responds to these girls. Continuing the example above: His response to said girl was something along the lines of: I agree, but when you weigh the momentary thrill against a long-term relationship, it's an easy decision. It's not the worst thing he could've said, but if someone had said that to me, I would've snapped at them for insinuating that I would cheat and for trying to jeopardize our relationship. This would be nothing short of a How the fuck dare you moment. Am I being unreasonable or is his response actually too mellow?

I'm 21 living with my mom, and my brother who previously lived in a different state (originally with my dad) unexpectedly moved in about a month ago. I'm not even sure how to begin..

Well about a year ago I started a volunteering position at a local sexual trauma response center, but before beginning the actual volunteer work, we have to take training sessions. The third day of training we talked about childhood sexual trauma and during the presentations, some trauma of my own unearthed. I don't remember very much except for a few scenes from my childhood of my brother touching me and asking to touch me, and moments when he was masturbating with me in the room while we watched a horror movie. 

When this trauma surfaced during the training, I told one of the supervisors and we decided that I should use their counseling services and I couldn't volunteer. I should mention (as I did mention to my counselor) that my brother has a multitude of mental disabilities, and it was unlikely that he was mentally aware of the impact of his actions at the ages when he was abusing me (which might have been as early as me being 3 and him 5 to as late as him being 12-13). This of course doesn't excuse his actions, but only makes things somewhat harder to deal with.

I went through the 10-week counseling. I didn't really feel satisfied by the end. I didn't finish feeling like a strong warrior ready to embrace being a ""survivor"" and I didn't feel like a victim crippled by depression or anxiety because of my childhood. I just went along with my life still resentful towards my brother, with only my counselors aware of what I had realized.

So my brother has lived in another state with my dad's family since I was in middle school, and he graduated high school then went to a vocational type of school for disabled young people. After he finished there, he moved in with his girlfriend and that was his situation up until like 2 months ago. My dad's family was glad to get him out of the house because he's the mentally disabled son from the previous marriage. They were very verbally and physically abusive to him.

Now a little more recently, he was arrested a few months ago for masturbating in a mcdonald's. I'm not exactly sure how the legal process is happening with this, but he was found guilty but he and his lawyer scheduled an appeal. But in some ridiculous series of events, he was homeless and couldn't live with his girlfriend, so our grandpa put him on a plane to here and notified my mom and me the morning of. I was panicking. I never suspected that I'd have to confront this. I spent as much time the first week with my boyfriend (whom I explained everything to) until he moved one stated over due to a job he just got (really great timing). I've been keeping busy with school finals, helping the bf move and visiting him for christmas, but I still can't escape this person.

He's living on a blow-up mattress in our fucking livingroom because our apartment is only 2-bedroom. It's just not good. He still has that appeal in court but who knows how or if he's going to go to it. He just got a job at a fast food place down the road. I don't want him to stay. Our relationship is bad because I'm mean and he has this vendetta against me because I have had him blocked on facebook for years. He takes the position that family should always be loving and friendly and communicate. I simply cannot do that. I graduate college in May and I'll be moving in with my boyfriend, but these 4 months seem like such a giant mountain of time.

 I don't know if I can tell my mom about what happened when we were kids. I know she'd believe me, but I don't know what good it would do. I can't confront him and I don't think I even want to. I can't be nice to him because I have so much resentment. I just really wanted some outside advice or perspective. This is really just the tip of the iceberg of the situation, and this post is already extremely long. Thanks for reading

Is it unfair to ask her to tell him, just that I have a piece of mind?.

Had a relationship with my GF for 2 years. We broke up about a year ago. She had a boyfriend for several months and I had an affair. Both my affair and their relationship have since ended.

For the whole time I told her that I'd love to get back together and give it another try but she was hesitant because so much had happened with other people that she couldn't cope with. 

A few weeks ago she admitted having had another fling with her flatmate but that she ended it and that she now clearly understood that I was the right person to be with her. We got back together about three weeks ago but I'm not very satisfied with how the relationship is going right now. She seems more distant than before and I would like to have more intimacy. 

The thing that's really bothering me is, that she won't tell her flatmate that we're back together out of respect for his feelings. I can understand her and also I don't know what his thoughts about the situation would be, but I think I need more signs of commitment. 

Is it unfair to ask her to tell him we're in a relationship? She said she wants to move in with me in the long run and I can understand she doesn't want to cause awkward situations in her flat until then.

**tl;dr**: I feel like my husband has developed a very serious Jekyll/Hyde personality and I can't help feel like I'm responsible. I feel like I 'broke' the kind person he was, and I don't know where to go from here. Financially speaking, I do not believe it's possible to end the marriage.

First of all, I did add a few years onto our ages, as my husband is very frequent Redditor.  I've wanted to post my situation for a while, but I do fear he'll see it and be upset.

My husband and I met through work and dated for about a year before we got married.  I have a child from a previous relationship (splits time 50/50 between our house, and her fathers,) and we also have two of our own. 

Our relationship started off amazing (don't they all.)  He treated me like a queen.  It was wonderful to have someone that into me, and he really treated me just as great up until about 2 years into our marriage.

Like a lot of people, I have struggled with depression for a long long time.  I don't come from a healthy family and had a terrible childhood.  The depression was mild, but changed to more severe after I had my 3rd child.  I have attempted on two occasions to see a therapist, but on both occasions I have stopped going after a few sessions.  It's really hard for me (kind of an understatement) to talk openly about myself, and I just couldn't muster up the courage to do it.  I thought that a therapist would make me feel comfortable enough to talk, but I just felt judged.  Despite that, I did get prescribed an antidepressant  from my GP and I feel like it is really helping.  

Ok, now back to my marriage…

As I mentioned before, my husband treated me phenomenally up until about a year ago.  He was always super kind and patient.  He was always positive and really a great father. He told me I was beautiful every day.  Brought me flowers all the time.  Just made me feel really great about myself.  Every second he wasn't working, he was taking the children to the museum, or zoo, or to the park.  He was constantly trying to think of fun things to for us all to do.  I wasn't always appreciative of him, I was often in a bummed out mood, or annoyed with him for this reason or that. I sometimes got mad for really not good reasons at all.  I hardly complimented him. I knew it had to do with the depression, and it did get particularly bad after my 3rd child.  I feel like once I got on the meds all of that got better.  I felt like I was able to 'not sweat the small stuff' so to speak and to be generally a good person to be around.

This is where things get a little convoluted, because I feel like when I started to feel better and like myself, thats around the time that he started to completely change. I think it might make things easier to just list out some of the problems.

- He criticizes my parenting.  He thinks I'm too hard on the children because I sometimes raise my voice, or get overwhelmed.  I'm with these kids all day long.  I know I'm a really great parent, but sometime I do get overwhelmed and I'm not perfect.  I thought that was normal.

- He has slowly stopped helping AT ALL around the house.  Like, he does absolutely nothing.  I know, I know, he works around 45 hours a week, but the children are young and a lot of work.  He doesn't just do nothing at home, he does play with the kids.  Also note, he was the one pushing for me to have both of the children that we had together.  It was his dream to have this family life, and I have brought that up to him.  In addition to all of the household chores, I have to also do the landscaping/mow the lawn.  The inside of the house desperately needs painting and I've been working on it for months.  I can only get a little done here and there because I'm usually too tired at the end of the day.  I have to pay all of the bills, and do all of the shopping. I do the cooking and put the kids to bed.  I ask him to help me and he says he will, but doesn't repeatedly.  On several occasions I've broken down into tears, telling him I just can't get it all done and need help.  He's admitted then and a few other times that he doesn't see why I can't just do it all since he works and I stay home.  He's so weird though, because when I don't ask him to do anything and I just 'do it' he goes on and on about how I do too much, and says things like 'you shouldn't have to do that after all you've done today…' I just blow comments like that off because I don't want to start an argument.

-I don't trust him anymore.  I don't mean about cheating on me, although I don't even feel like I know him anymore so who knows.  We have had some REALLY heated arguments within the past 6 months.  He has recorded me (I didn't know it at the time) on his phone talking about smoking marijuana so that if we did get a divorce, he could make sure that he would have primary custody of the children.  Let me just say this, I do smoke sometimes when I'm hanging with the kids.  I don't get all crazy stoned, I take a couple hits and have a blast playing matchbox cars or doing art. I'm a mature adult and I know my tolerance.  What's funny is that he is a huge pothead.  He smokes constantly when he's not at work.  I couldn't believe he would do this to me.  I still really can't believe it.  I mean, who the hell does that. 

-During a arguments he has told me to just kill myself and 'do everyone a favor.' [I] should just do it before I scar the children with my bad parenting.  I can't even tell you how bad this hurts me.  I've worked a job since I was 15 and it was really hard for me to transition to staying at home.  I feel like I'm hard enough on myself and I really do try very hard to raise them to be happy, well adjusted kids.  Really, if he would have said this to me a year and a half ago I would have died of shock.  I really can't believe it.

We don't argue in front of the children, which is good, but they can definitely sense when we aren't on good terms and it does make the house tense.  I really don't want to fuck them up.

My husband really doesn't make a whole lot of money.  We don't struggle, we have the things we need, with a little extra, but if I leave him I will not be able to afford living on my own and taking care of them.  I really do feel like I can't afford to leave.

I feel like the time I was depressed just broke him.  I feel like he was a great person until I just wore him down to be like this heartless cruel man.  He says that I nag him ALL THE TIME and that I never say anything nice.  I hate that I'm thought of as the typical naggy wife.  I ask him to help me… like i tell him 'today can you do this…' or 'this weekend can you do that…' but he just doesn't when he says he will.  Yeah, I guess after 6 months of not doing something that NEEDS to be done, I do start to 'nag.'  He says I'm never in a good mood and I bring everyone down with me.  I know thats how I used to be.  Could he just not be letting go of the past, or am I crazy.  Have the antidepressants not been working? Have I not changed at all? I know you all won't know that answers to those questions, but these are just the things that I ask myself all the time.  I really do feel like the 'bell jar' I was in when I was depressed has been lifted and I am nice and fun.

These fights aren't daily, but they are often enough to where we are currently just civil to each other.  Normally after the children go to bed, we hang.  It's actually the only time we don't fight, but we had another fight so I've just been avoiding him.  I know everyone preaches communication and being honest, but I've tried over and over and I feel like I'm not being heard.  When these fights started, he apologized a lot for his actions, but he rarely apologizes anymore. He admits some fault SOMETIMES, but it's becoming more and more rare, and I think often that it's just to smooth things over, and he doesn't really mean it.  I started to avoid talking about these fights after the fact because I feel like when he recounts the situation, it's not ever what really happened.  Or maybe it is, and I'm wrong.

I've told him how much he has hurt me.. we've talked about him criticizing my parenting and telling me to kill myself.  He apologizes profusely, but with the next argument, it's more hurtful words.  I'm guilty with the hurtful words too.  I've threatened divorce and called him lazy.  I've called him a few other choice words as well, but in the moment I just couldn't believe the things he was saying to me and felt like it was warranted. 

I feel like I can't talk to him about anything anymore.  I don't feel like i'm a Debbie Downer, but on the occasion I do want to vent about something, I'm afraid he'll use it as ammo against me, saying that I can't handle things, like he has in the past.

Please keep in mind that I'm telling you all of the bad stuff, and not the good.  The good in between the bad is really good.  I do feel like this isn't 'him' and it's not just his true colors showing.  He does see a therapist and does take anxiety medicine.  I'm not sure for how long.  He has a few different bottles.  Could medicine like that cause someone to act irrational like this?  When I say Jekyl and Hyde I mean he is acting so crazy when he used to be the sanest person I knew.  It doesn't seem like he's just being a dick.  Could I try to contact his therapist? Is that a bad idea?  I suggested it multiple times to him but he blows it off.

Reading through what I've written so far, it sounds like he doesn't love, respect, or care about me at all, but I know he does.  I really do.  It's like the simplest thing will completely set him off.  Could it be me?  Could I have an attitude or tone and not know it?  Could my shitty past cause me to talk to people in a shitty way and not even know it?  

I don't have anyone to talk to, so please give me some insight.

First and foremost, I'll just say it.

 **I fucked up.**

 I cheated, lied about it, and got caught in a big way. I was stationed overseas in 2007, and as a 19 y/o in the Air Force medical field, I went buck wild. 

I started dating A when I was in college in 2005. I was such a punk back then, I didn't give two shits about school, and ended up dropping out after a semester. A stuck with me, always my biggest cheerleader. This girl grew so much as a person in just two short years, looking back, it's unbelievable. She was a bigger partier than me when we started dating, really, that's what drew me to her. The idea of a girl who could outdrink me was intensely attractive, but by the end, she was the one dragging me to church on Sundays. 

I had no scope of how much transformation was really taking place with A; I just knew that she was starting to show signs of wanting to settle down. 

I left to join the Air Force (late 2006), excited at the prospect of travel. I didn't realize that the medical world of the military is highly female dominated, and fresh out of basic training, locked in the dorms with nothing but women went to my head in such a way, that looking back it's almost embarrassing.  

A called every night, and I remember being thankful more than a few times that she wasn't actually there to smell other girls on me. I left for Japan for my first assignment, after spending two weeks basically living with A while home on leave. I honestly believe that I fell hardest for her then. I gave her what was essentially a promise ring, but ended up calling it a ""don't forget about me while I'm in Japan"" ring, because commitment still somehow freaked me out.

I was a selfish person. I wanted it all. 

I drank, fucked, and whored my way across the island of Japan. In spite of 3000 miles and 5 time zone changes, A woke up at 6AM MST to call me at 11PM JST. **Every. Day.** And she was always so happy. On occasions where I called her first, she always made herself sound like she'd been awake when I called. I loved that. She didn't want me to know how stressful it was for her. 

I would piss and moan about how things at work sucked, and she always made me feel better. I took all the love she had to give. 

In 2008, I was accepted to the Air Force Academy, and returned stateside, relieved to be within 30 minutes of A; I felt that we could have a real relationship now that I was back, and was fully content to forget about my asshole choices in Japan. 

It all came crashing down when my phone went off while I was in the shower. A gave it a quick check, and a Japanese girl had chosen that moment to fill my inbox with nude selfies. 

I tried to lie my way out of it, and she saw right through it. Instantly, this person who had sacrificed so much just to try and be closer to me was pushed away by my fucked up decisions. 

I don't know if I'll ever find adequate words to express how I feel about what I've done in the half a decade since. I know in my soul that I can't trust myself. I don't feel worthy of someone's love and attention, because I know what I've done to the person who gave absolutely everything about their self to me. 

She found a new guy about a year after, they got married within 8 months, and recently had their first child. That really makes me happy, because she talked about kids so much, and she absolutely, totally, deserves to me happy with a family that doesn't take the love she so freely gives for granted. 

I am so beyond sorry. I am so *broken* by this, I haven't had a serious relationship since. I feel like I'm holding women up to an unfair criterion, because I cannot keep myself from comparing them to A. 

It would be a lie to say I haven't had suicidal desires and ideation since then. I feel so utterly hopeless, unworthy, and low. 

Reddit, please help me move on.

124880,Non-Romantic,2l6muz,"Hi! So, as the title says, my boyfriend (let's call him ""Bruce"") and I invited his family (mom, brother and sister-in-law, plus their 3 kids) for Thanksgiving.


This is my first time moving from my parents' house, and my boyfriend and my's first time moving a state away from our families. We have been here a month now, and I am still stressed and frazzled from the move. 

Background: I have bipolar I disorder (leaning towards depression), General Anxiety Disorder (GAD), and OCD (all of these things diagnosed). Lately, I have felt very depressed and like I am ""out of control"" with things around me. The only thing I have ""control"" of, is my kitchen.


Problem 1: My parents gifted us new pots and pans (they are so awesome, seriously), and I don't want them being banged around or scraped with anything metal. I get panicky if things are done ""wrong"" ....putting silverware in the wrong place, pots and pans being banged around (repeating myself), things not being put back a certain way. I would love to just ""get over it"", but it's just not that easy.  


How would I go about gently asking them not to do these things? My main concern are the pots and pans. I can always fix the other things myself and contain myself not to make a big deal out of it. Once again, the only thing I feel I have control over in my life right now is the kitchen. I know I sound crazy, but I would please just love some advice.


Problem 2: OKAY. So. I really like Bruce's family, as in, we already consider us to all be family. Obviously, there are things here-and-there that irritate me, but that happens in everyone's family. My issue is having them in my house for a few days and now having a complete meltdown. My meds are not optimal right now, and I am finding it near impossible to find a GOOD psychiatrist near me to fix that. I would love some advice from anyone who has had in-laws at their place and handled it professionally even if they were going mad.  



I am pretty introverted, but when around people I am definitely extroverted. I joke around and smile a lot, even if I don't want to. It is ridiculously draining on me. I will definitely be stepping away a few times throughout the ""weekend"", but I truly don't want to snap... a.k.a. go crazy or be an asshole. Any advice on keeping my cool while stressed would be awesome. I will be attempting to implement ""coping"" tactics, but they don't always work.


Once again: I would like help with nicely asking pots and pans not to be banged around and what to do if it happens anyway, how to handle in-laws at my place professionally, and how to keep my cool when I feel like I am going to explode

Also, I don't know if it's worth mentioning, but originally I said ""no"" to Bruce's family coming. I thought it would be too much stress and make me very uncomfortable, but I would rather be uncomfortable and see him happy than basically be a dick and have him be unhappy. I want to keep my composure so I don't upset him and ruin the time he has with his family (he can't go home for Christmas due to his job)

72631,Breakups,35z89j,"Hello. Throwaway because I have friends on here.

I have been with my boyfriend Peter for about 4 years. We met at my best friend's graduation party about 4 years ago. I was 18 at the time and quickly fell in love with him. We got along very well and would hang out quite frequently. I knew from the beginning that he used drugs but it didn't start bothering me until we became official. I was taught they were bad and it's a mentality that's hard to change but I'm overcoming it. I believe they can be recreational and whatnot.

I know this is going to sound really bad but I'm a controlling girlfriend. I'm extremely insecure and I need to know every little detail or I assume the worst. I've been this way in every relationship. One boyfriend would just lie to me but I always caught him. He was somewhat sketchy and he ended up cheating on me. Another boyfriend would neglect me and got so fed up he dumped me.

Peter has been amazing since day one, never been suspicious and has always been there for me. My actions have pushed him away, along with anyone else I've been with and I know this relationship is reaching the end. He's so done with me but won't break up with me. He must still care right?

I'm not good with heartbreaks or break ups. I don't think anyone is. I'm hurting so much. I know I need to change. I think I should be single for a while and work on myself before I enter another relationship or it will always be the same. I'm normally an independent person but once I enter a relationships everything is about them and it shouldn't be that way. Do I have issues?

I guess my question is how did you guys deal with heartbreaks? I know I'm not the greatest person but I just want someone to talk to so I came here. I don't want to drag my family into unnecessary drama. I don't want to keep bugging him so I stopped texting him as he is very stressed right now so I'm on my laptop listening to cheesy love songs and drinking wine.

So I met this guy last week

We have been texting almost 24/7


We hung out on Friday, Had dinner got drunk, got naughty. Got along really well. Have chattered since..



Last night he came over to watch a movie (Batman). 

We had really good sex after that.. But then he got a little too chummy. 

Like burping heaps.. He farted last night too (quietly). 

And this morning he let out a huge fart.






I dont really care that he did it, but its kind of weird right? like after 2 nights together. 



What do you guys think? Thinks im just a mate and not interested, or comfortable?

189410,Breakups,2ohz3k,"About the age difference, he thought I was 18 when we met. I was dealing with the trauma of a recent abortion and being molested by my father at the time and was just in a bad place. I drank a lot, smoked a lot, had a lot of sex &amp; just was so miserable. I lied to him A LOT back then, unfortunately.


Anyways, because of my lying issues and being sneaky early on in the relationship (I really wasn't too sure if we were actually legitimately dating so I was having sex with other guys and he was mad at me for that, which was understandable) he's always had big trouble trusting me, **especially after this one situation:**


He never really complimented me, and wasn't very touchy with me so I craved attention. Some fucker from my old job had interest in me and wanted to hang out, so I did. I didn't care for him I just liked the attention. We hung out one night. No touching, not even a hug. A few days later my boyfriend somehow found out and got livid, and thought I did something with this coworker (I did not.)

Of course it was really fucked up of me. I said sorry. I truly was. I begged for forgiveness. He said 'this is the last time you'll ever see me' and left my house. I, being a complete emotional wreck decided to chase after him in mine. He eventually lost me and I went to a girl friend's house for support. For a week I was texting him and no response. During that week I was drinking vodka for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I eventually went over to my coworkers house. He kissed me and I kissed him back. Not really sure why. He was pressuring me into going further but I was so upset over my boyfriend who I thought had broken up with me, so I left. I also drunkenly hooked up with one of my ex's from the past one night. Absolutely nothing past that.

A few days later my boyfriend comes back. He's so angry he scratches my car as he pulls up. He just looks so angry. I grew up in a very abusive home so I was very scared and starting crying and shivering. He said he wanted to strangle me. He asked what I did while he was gone and I told him. He grew even more angry and told me that I cheated on him and that I ""definitely"" had sex with both of them. I did not think this was fair because I thought he had broken up with me.. how is that cheating if he TOLD me we were over??

---

Anyways eventually things got better but every couple of weeks or so he would bring it up again and how I lied about not having sex with them. He got very controlling and paranoid.. some **examples..**

* I will do my makeup to go to a cafe to study (hey, I like being cute) and he will get angry and ask who I was meeting... simply because I had makeup on.
* Almost every day he checks my phone (texts, pictures, web history etc)
* I have to tell my guy friends to contact me on facebook because I can 'delete texts'. He thinks it's impossible for guys to be friends with girls. My guy friends are very respectful and kind men and we truly are just friends.
* I got pregnant with his child and really wanted to carry it to full term, because of how traumatic my last abortion was. He threatened to kill himself if I didn't get an abortion. I did not have the money to pay for it so he paid for it himself $800.
* He told me I could not hang out with one of my friends here because she tried to hook me up with one of her friends once.
* He refused to go out with me in public, either because of age difference or because he was embarrassed to be the boyfriend of someone who used to be a 'whore'
* I stopped going out with friends because I was scared of making him angry and I didn't want to make him paranoid. I go out with someone only about once every four months, I'd say.
* The last few months he has been acting a lot better, however. Still a bit controlling though. But definitely more loving, caring and affectionate.


**Our Backgrounds:**
- I come from an upperclass family. He comes from a poor one.
- My father was abusive for the majority of my life, but my mother cared very much for me. His father died when he was a baby and his mother was not a very nurturing one. She did just enough to keep him clothed and alive.
- I am guaranteed to take over my father's company and with inheriting family warehouses, I will be making $100k + a year when the time comes. I am going to school now and will eventually get my bachelors.
- He has not finished college. He has a job but not a career. He's not sure what he will do. 
- Take note that he is a LOT better looking than I am. He looks young for his age and has a very nice body, and could probably get any girl he wants.


**Reason why I am moving:**
I'm running out of money and need help from my parents. All of my friends are there back in my homestate and I am going crazy from having no socialization. The state is also less expensive, and there are many more opportunities to grow. I am in a terrible mental state and just need my friends and a better financial situation.

I've told him he could come with me but he cannot afford to. I really love him and he is the only person I am comfortable to tell things to. Even though he is controlling, he DOES care for me. He makes me laugh a lot and will do nice things for me. I am very mentally and emotionally troubled from my past and I feel like no one else would deal with me. He too has some problems.

I don't know how to handle this. Should we stay together until I move? He has taught me a lot of good things and has made me into a better person. I want to stay in contact with him after I move. 

I don't really know why i'm posting here, maybe I just want to hear from other people that it is okay to let go and that things will be okay. Or maybe I want to hear that the relationship is not fixable and it would be better for both of us. Just let me know what you think about this whole situation?

I know from another co-worker that any day now S is going to have sex with a married man.  I think part of the reason nothing followed after our first dates was that she started seeing this guy; she was seeing me at the same time, but with waning interest.

We've been together for a year now. I have never had a particularly strong sexual attraction towards my SO, but it was always enough that I enjoyed sex when it happened and we could get on happily with our lives. For the last four to five months (not long since moving in together) my attraction to her has steadily diminished.

Now I find the idea of sex with her revolting. I just don't find her sexy anymore. Not even slightly. On the odd occasion that we do have sex, its very much a perfunctory task for me. She has a high libido (as do I usually), so its salient to her that we're not doing it very often and that I'm turning it down all the time.

I don't really feel like her boyfriend anymore and I don't know what to do about this. I don't know what to tell her. I don't want to hurt her but I can't continue pretending that I'm happy or satisfied in our relationship.

I should add: I love her dearly and ideally I want to identify and solve this problem rather than running away.

82141,Non-Romantic,2fh6m4,"I started going to college 4 years ago and I moved out of my family home to the dorms, the university I attended was only about 30 minutes away from home by mom was still bitterly upset and crying. When I first got to the dorms my mom would randomly drop by and attempt to go up to my room but the security desk at the dorm prevented her from doing so. When they stopped her my mom would scream and sometimes wait for hours until I came down (without the knowledge that she was there waiting for me). I became notorious with the RAs for having a very insistent and rude mother who would do this.
 Eventually my mom started calling me every day, multiple times a day, I didn't answer because I was in class. When I did answer she would just talk about her day and ask me why I never came home. Even if I did answer one of her phone calls throughout the day she would continue to call at least 3 more times to repeat the previous discussion. Simultaneously with these calls she would text me, walls of text about her feelings, about her pets, about what she was doing. It was all right but slightly frustrating to look at my phone after being in class for an hour to see 15 received texts all from my mom. 
Eventually I moved into a dorm which had its own phone my mom found out that number by calling the front desk of the dorm and telling them that it was an emergency and she had to talk to me as soon as possible but in reality I had fallen asleep or something and just hadn't responded to her new text messages/calls of the day. These calls and texts would come at all hours starting at 6am To wake you up for your early classes!when she didn't even know my class schedule (and I've never had an early morning class) until 1am Just to let you know I'm praying for you. It was particularly embarrassing because of how loud the phone was, it would disturb my roommates.
 I moved out of the dorms my Junior year, I was living with two other friends and promptly upon learning where I had moved my mom would drop by unannounced , if I wasn't home she would bully my housemates into letting her in so she could wait inside, she would try to get into my room (but I generally left it locked) if she didn't get access to my room she would insist on talking to my housemates or waiting angrily in the living room (she would be angry that I didn't tell her I was going out and I had taken so long even though she had dropped by unannounced). 
I've asked her multiple times throughout the years to please stop or at least tone down how often you call/text. 

I've moved to a new place with housemates who will not be bullied, my mom tried once and was effectively told off. I live on the top floor and I generally leave my window open for a nice breeze, I woke up last week to the sound of my mom screaming my name from the street because she had dropped by unannounced and I was napping but she wanted to have dinner with me. 

Am I being horrible? I feel like I am sometimes, like I should appreciate this incessant contact from her but its just disrespectful to me if I have asked her multiple times to desist and yet she continues. 
 Just today I have received 8 texts from her starting at 9am even though yesterday I asked her to please stop texting me so much (the grand total yesterday was 15 texts and 3  phone calls). 

I'm sorry about the rant. I'm just overwhelmed by guilt, exhaustion, frustration and confusion. 

To clarify, my mother has never paid for my college or living expenses since I turned 18, I have either had it paid for with scholarships or my own work. 

I don't know how to get her to stop, I find it to be very stressful and frustrating. What should I do? Am I being horrible? Have you ever experienced this? Is this normal?

170425,Relationships,2j0sld,"I'll try to keep this as short as possible; but a little backstory:

His name is Brett (*name changed to protect identity). We met freshman year of college, one of my friends had also had sex with him before i did. We hooked up, but had to keep it on the down low because it would probably hurt her if she found out about us (even though she had numerous other partners). Long story short, she found out and me and him continued to have sex and eventually date for a few months.

It was a very toxic relationship, with me putting in way more effort than was reciprocated, caring too much about him, not demanding enough respect yada yada yada. We both transfer to a different college after freshmen year, i break up with him right before the new school year as we were both going in opposite directions in our lives. I was getting really into a sorority life, he was doing the more hippy thing.

We don't speak for a year, both of us going through huge personal transformations. I dropped my sorority, and became more sure of myself, my convictions, and beliefs. In January of this year, Brett came back to uni and we came back into each others lives really suddenly. We started hooking up again, old feelings resurfaced, the connection was definitely still there, the whole deal. Of course, we tried to play it off as ""we're just ex's who have sex' for quite a while too.

Since January, its been a crazy roller coaster ride. While the relationship wasn't toxic, i could still tell i wasn't being treated as i deserve (with me doing tons of things for him, never asking for anything in return). I did/do all these things because I'm absolutely crazy for the kid, I've never met anyone who makes me feel the way he does. 

Just in the past couple months (we were apart for 2 months this summer, when we reunited he realized how good i treat him and he's just as crazy about me) has it been different. We've finally started being a 'real couple', and he's finally as invested in this as i have always been. The only thing is, i don't know if i could ever really trust him, we have so much history together, with me having to see him and other girls, me not respecting myself enough to ask for something real from him...I feel like we've been through way too much to ever have a real future. 

Im abroad this semester, and he's planning on coming to visit me in December, but I'm wondering if i should use this time and space to try and get over him, if its time to. I have the most fun with him, he can always make me smile. But he's also made me cry too many times, i just don't know if i should keep him in my life, or remove him completely to open myself up for something better. Please help reddit!

We love each other very much, but the stress in his life (mostly financial/from owning a business) and our age difference felt like too much to overcome. He tried so hard not to involve me in his work problems, but it felt like stress was invading our relationship from all sides. I didn’t feel that comfortable around his friends, or family, and vice-versa. 

I know it is naïve, but we became best friends (both of us knew it was odd, but nonetheless felt that way), and a big part of me believed it could work out.

We have talked about our differences before, but now it’s really over. He’s not mad, but he said he couldn’t ever talk to me again because of how in love with me he is, and he dropped off all my stuff. I guess part of me feels frustrated and hurt because he had said things like “I know you’re young; I’m not an idiot, if things work out, great, but if they don’t, I want to stay friends anyway and know you for a long time.” But now I really believe him when he says he can’t even see me again or know me again.

So after months of blindly walking, hoping I'll end up somewhere brighter, I sit on my chair and share my story with the masses in hopes of getting an answer that I've never heard of before. I expect most of the answers to be: 

""The only one who can think of the proper way to fix it, is yourself"", but I'm very naive and hope that just this once, an exception will occur.

So about 8 months ago, I was sitting on the same chair I'm sitting on today (difference being is that now I use it to think), when suddenly my friend (let's call him ""Jake"") calls me on the phone saying this:

""Alex, I got your girlfriend here, can we come over?"". I was swallowing my own saliva as he said it, and I started coughing after getting surprised.

I'm not sure what I was thinking, but for some reason I agreed and now I was in a hurry to get my house clean, which proved to be a pointless task as they didn't even come up to the apartment.

After they arrived, I went downstairs and saw them both, my eyes stayed on Jake, I was infuriated, angry on my friend, but at the same time scared of the person beside him, as she was a stranger.

Jake: ""Alex, meet (let's call her Claire) Claire, Claire, meet Alex"".

I couldn't stand looking at a stranger directly in the eyes, but I managed to do so and she smiled, I immediately looked away and I could feel my face turning red. I grabbed my friend and took him about a meter away and started whispering to him:

""Are you sane?! I never asked for this! (I was then reminded I did) You know I'm bad with strangers!""

""Calm down. Now, I'll give you a little bit of cash so you can both go, eat ice-cream and talk""

""I'm lactose intolerant, remember?"" (I made sure my excuses were not lies, but they obviously weren't enough to justify not doing something)

""Then go somewhere else"".

""I'm busy, I have a driving lesson soon"".

""When?""

""Two hours""

""That's plenty of time!, look, I will accompany you if you want to.""

I looked back at Claire, she smiled again, I quietly asked her to excuse us (not sure if she even heard) and I pulled my friend into the corridor of my building, away from her view, there was no door so it's possible that she could still hear us.

""I can't do this, I'm not mentally prepared! (that was the same damn excuse I used every single time, no matter how many times I have already seen her, or talked to her, be it via messages, calls or talking face-to-face) You know I'm too bad at this!""

""Yes, I knew, but I had no idea it was this bad...""

""Well it can be worse!""

Suddenly, Claire spoke up, still out of view.

""Hey, if he doesn't want to, he doesn't have to""

I felt a jolt run through my heart, I felt regret, but also thankful.

""Will you be okay with choosing your own appropriate time to meet with her?"" He asked.

""Sure, whatever, just go!"" Again, why did I agree?

I went up, called my other friend (We'll him ""Nir""), and sounding surprised as well, he came to my house and we discussed the situation, I didn't even remember her name so I couldn't tell him when he asked, and then the first friend came to my home as well.

I told them I hated surprises, I REALLY hated them, and I asked from Jake to gather up random information about her, so I could be prepared to deal with whatever kind of person I was dealing with. 

(I always try to make it seem like I'm against the world, yes, I need to get rid of that mentality)

It turned out that there actually might be some subjects I could talk with her about, and I agreed to set up an actual date, stupidly enough at Jake's house, but I was broke and too shy to actually consider other options, as I don't even know what option is the best one.

The date went on fine, the problem was is that every time we've met, I was disappointed that I didn't talk a lot, yet she always told my friends who asked her how it was, that she actually enjoyed talking with me.

I just shrugged it off every single time and thought she was feeling sorry for me.

I always had trouble texting her back (there's no point in saying texting her, I only initiated the texting once), always thinking ""No, there's a better plan somewhere, I know there is...""

Then, 6 months later of struggling to talk with her, and expressing my feelings, which I wasn't even sure what they were, I decided to cut the connection. 6 months and our relationship was in the same state as it was from the start, I watch the same message she sent me for hours, then regret it when I don't answer. I didn't want to put up with the pressure and I though that it would be a good idea to make her stop going through the hell that is me as well.
I hated myself every time she sent a message, I wanted to answer, but I couldn't, I never asked her to go out with me, she had to be the one, and every time we both went to Jake's house and we drank, I just couldn't let the alcohol take over, I struggled to keep the effects in and my head would painfully pound over and over, she asked me whether or not was I okay so I assume she noticed, although I'm not sure if she knew that it was because she was there.

On new year's eve, I was already too exhausted and afraid of Claire, I convinced myself that it's time to end it but I was not able to do it face-to-face, as I'm a coward, I never hurt anyone before directly, and I was sure as hell I didn't want to see the face of the person I will hurt.

Everyone already knew I wanted to end the relationship, and when Jake asked me if I'm coming over to his house, I said yes. When he told me Claire is also coming, my answer was instantly changed to ""No"", and he just sighed and told me that she couldn't come anyway. 

I never drank like I drank on that night, I chugged two halves of champagne bottles, and drank about 2 shots of Vodka, next thing I remember, I'm throwing up red in the toilet, and I'm crying.

I ran to the kitchen, bashed my head into the fridge, and squeezed myself into the corner, pulling my hair as hard as I could, I was crying from the pain, I was terrified of something, Nir told me that was a panic attack, so I'll go with that.

This is the turning point where I just continuously screw up, time... after... time...

On my 18th birthday, a few days after new year's eve, I didn't exactly celebrate, but me and my friend Nir bought some whiskey and went to his apartment to drink.

The first thing he suggests is this:

""Hey, how about we message Claire?"" Nir asked.

""Hmph"" I shrugged.

He took his phone and texted her: (I just want to make this clear: we were never officially a couple, at least, I don't think we were, there was nothing exactly to end, nothing began in the first place, but I'm not sure if there would have been a time which we could officially label as the beginning of our relationship) ""Hey Claire, how's it going?""

""Fine, what about you?"" She answered.

""I'm good, currently drinking with a friend"" (I don't remember the exact words, but I do remember the context being bad for the situation)

""Who?"" She asked.

""Your boyfriend"" He answered back. Now, I didn't remember this was what he wrote, and I realized that was probably not a good idea, he knew I wanted to the end relationship, and I never considered myself her boyfriend.

I'm not sure what she answered, could have been a blushing emote, maybe a ""Hihi"", maybe both, maybe a heart on top of everything.

When suddenly, for some reason, I thought that the appropriate time to end the relationship was that day, my birthday.

I have already forgotten it's my birthday and decided that ending the relationship was what mattered most.

I was too much of a coward to end if face-to-face, and now I'm going to show you just how badly I screwed up:

1. I broke up using a phone.
2. It wasn't my phone.
3. It was via texts.
4. Nir wrote the messages.
5. I didn't even proof-read, because I was too afraid I might change my mind. (By this time, I think you can realize that I'm indecisive)

After he sent the message that ended it, I felt remorse and instantly asked her if she wanted us to end it face-to-face.

Yes, that's what I asked, not whether or not she wanted to talk about it, but instead, I gave her two options, end it now, or later.
I didn't even realize what was wrong with my message until I read it again.

When I came back home, my mother greeted me and hugged me.

""Happy birthday!"" She said.

My heart sank, remembering that it was my birthday, I realized that I made a terrible mistake and I will never forget it.

A few minutes after I entered my room, I laid down on the bed, and hoped she would answer ""Yes"" to meet and talk.

Obviously, she answered ""No"", but the real kicker was when I read my message again and realized I screwed up.

The next day (average teenager cliche incoming), instead of walking to school I went to the place where my friends and I would sit and talk. It's a grassy area with trees, we had 3 sofas, a table and a bath tub which we used as a garbage container.

half an hour later, I decide that I'm bored and I call Nir over as he decided to skip school all together. (I was planning to go, but once I reached the point where I needed to turn, I continued to march forward to our little camp)

He brings the same whiskey we drank yesterday, we discuss the situation again, and as always he described the situation like this: ""I've no idea what we need to exactly do, it's the first time I've seen someone be in such a situation"". 

I'm sure there's someone who was in a situation that is at least somewhat close in similarity, although I have to admit, I have never met a person that is as closed as me, neither did my friends, and neither, unfortunately, the three psychologists which I've been sent to. (Two had no idea what to do with me, and the third made me look at a phone, and asked me what where the bumps called, I said that they were buttons, he said that I'm perfectly normal, and my time kept ticking away)

Jake came over to our camp as well and talked to Claire via messages, he tried to make her agree to talk with me by saying that I'm shy and introverted, and that's a regular problem with people like me (it's probably not). After he asked her to talk to me as a birthday present (I kind of hoped she wouldn't be reminded that it was my birthday, because having her know that my first decision as an 18 years old would be to break up with her felt wrong, and it wasn't my intention in the first place), we talked for a little bit, and walked back home after several hours of talking.

Back home, Jake texts me saying that Claire agrees, and I get excited saying that I will need to make a speech because of my terrible social skills.

This doesn't have a happy ending, and I'm not sure if there will be.

Two months... two entire months have passed since I broke up with her and I went drinking with friends. I drank, opened up a bit, and decided that that would be the day I would text her again and ask her to meet.

It went like this:

""When can we meet?"" (I completely forgot to even say ""Hi"")

""Who's this?"" There are two possibilities, one: She removed me from her contacts. (A totally justified action, before anyone assumes to know what is my opinion on that matter) and two: She asked whether it's me talking or Nir. (My friend, ""Gabriel"" thought of that, and it only took him a few seconds. I must say, I don't know how he knew so much about relationships without being in one, he said that it's all based on logic)

Kind of disappointed, but completely respecting, I decided to continue after a few minutes of thinking on what to write. A few suggested calling her a bitch (I hope it was a joke, they were drinking too and usually they're nice people when they know they need to act seriously) and others simply suggested to write my name.

I wanted to make sure she understood that I knew more about myself at that moment so I decided to write:

""The indecisive idiot""

To which Claire replied: ""Alex! Monday is fine, when?""

""When do you prefer?""

""5pm, what's the reason for the meeting? (This one kind of confused me, as I thought it would be obvious, although according to Jake she did eventually say ""I will forgive him even if he just texted me"") 'Jake convinced me is also an acceptable reason :P'""

""To talk"" I replied ""And this time, Jake did not convince me"" (Just this time...)

""Where do you want to meet?"" Claire asked.

""Somewhere near your home"" I chose the location, and I chose to meet her near her home so that she wouldn't have to walk as much as she did on our previous dates. We lived a fair distance away from each other, and I decided that if I screw up again, at least she will be closer to her home, and I will have a long way to think about how I screwed up, and how I could have made it better.

Too bad the location didn't matter.

""Alright, I accept"" She answered, and I was finally happy I had the courage to text her.

Too bad that's all the courage I had.

For three days, my heart kept beating at a faster pace, and then the day to meet Claire arrived.

I felt my heart beating all day, once I came back from school I started preparing for the meeting. I looked at the clock every few minutes, and the heart was beating faster every time I looked.

Took a shower, wore my best clothes, and an hour before the meeting, I was already too afraid to get out of the house.

I wasn't sure where she lived, I told Jake I'm feeling too much pressure and he suggested to either make up an excuse, or that he could just call her (or, obviously, I could just tell her...
I didn't...).

My mistake was asking Jake to call her to cancel the meeting, I screwed up as soon as I asked him to do that, it's entirely my fault, and as expected, everything got worse.

5:15 pm, I'm sitting on my chair, the same exact chair I talked about in the beginning, I've sat on it for an hour thinking how much of an idiot am I, how I could have fixed it, how ALL I needed to do was probably SHOW UP, when suddenly I get a message from Claire:

""Alex, are you on your way?""

My eyes opened wide and I was shocked, but what did I expect?

I asked Jake why didn't he tell her that I'm not coming and he told me she didn't answer.

He asked me if I wanted him to still call her, my other option was to call her myself, and stupidly, I chose the easier option.

Before disconnecting from every kind of social program, I asked Jake to confirm whether or not he successfully reached her, because if he couldn't, my other option would be to run to meet her.

Why meet her? Didn't I just say that I wanted to cancel the meeting? Well that's the thing, they are both options which would require me to talk to Claire, and I preferred the option to meet her.

Jake confirmed that she received his call, and I got called names which I deserved.

Then, I chose to disconnect from the world, and I'm not sure if that's a good idea, as that might have raised suspicion that I am planning to do something impulsive.

And here I am, on the same chair, writing about my most despised months of my life. 

A few hours have passed since the time me and Claire were supposed to meet, and I just don't know what the hell I need to do, and if there's even something I can and should do. I can't imagine ever facing her again, and to think that all I needed and wanted to do was say that I'm sorry for wasting 8 months of her life on trying to build me from the ground up.

I must say that after meeting Claire for the first time, I was more productive with my life than I ever was, and it was all because of her, and I just threw her away like trash, I know I'm still young, but I always thought that I will stay the same as always, and the fact that Claire is apparently perfect for me according to my friends makes me think that that's the end of my journey when it comes to relationships, if I screwed up trying to connect with someone who is perfect for me then what's the point to begin with?

I was given the perfect opportunity to fix myself, to finally be at piece with my silence, all this time I hoped the silence would go away and I would start opening up but after this, I realize that sometimes, staying silent is the best option, and other times, it is the worse option, and I need to reach the perfect balance between silence and communication.

Any kind of help would be appreciated, because I don't believe I can dig up anything out of myself anymore.

I don't expect anyone to read this. 

So we me online, and everything was amazing. 
As it always is at the start of the relationship.
We are laughing, joking around being hopeless,
I talk about buying tickets to come and see her
she is ecstatic about it, can't wait etc...
Occasional banter with her family.

We talk and mess around on skype, just normal shit.
I forgot to mention I'm Australian and she is from the US.

Anyway, I end up buying tickets for the 28/10/14 (3 days from now)
to visit her for 3 months. 
Everything is prepared, bought passport, 
new case all that stuff for flying.
Tickets cost me an arm and a leg, I didn't care about that,
because I thought I had strong feelings for her.
Where she said countless times she needed me,
she wanted me there.
She was struggling, and cut her self etc.
She had a bad few years, got fucked over by a lesbian etc. 
Addicted to Coke.
Pushed drugs all that shit. 
She still does. But doesn't have coke.. 
not that I know of. I dont care anymore. 
She can get arrested for all I care.

Now I'm not one for bitter break ups and all that. 
But we were going through a rocky patch, 
kinda just anxious about the trip, I was super excited.
And I thought she was too. 
But apparently she had been feeling indifferent about it
For quite some time, leading me on, if you will.

I had to skip out on a University interview because I was going away. 
I cancelled a lot of my things that I now need to fix. 
Just the day before she beckoned me to buy more credit for the app we used.
which was expensive, and money I didn't have to spend. 
but I did it so we could chat.
At least I thought we were going to chat, she said it was worth it.

I have to cancel the flights.
I dont see much of that money back.
She didn't even call, or IM, nothing. 
Just blocked me on all fronts. :(
Posts bitter things about me. I was never unkind to her. 
It happened in 30 minutes. with a 24 hour wait between
""I dont want to see you, maybe 9 months or 6 months down the track but not now""
I said ""good bye ___, I love you."" 
Not a word back. 

She was treated like shit beforehand, I didn't push myself on her
I always told her, ""I can wait for you to blossom"" etc. 
I didn't say to her, I can help make you better, I need to fix you etc.
Now, I have to just fucking sit here, get stoned. 
Buy a theremin with the tiny tiny return i get on the tickets
and try to build a portfolio.

How can something so right go so wrong in an instant?
I don't hold it against her.. I just wish she could have let me know sooner. 
She never spoke her mind enough and always shut me out. 
""The universe does what it does, everything happens for a reason"" - Her.
No, you have to make things happen for yourself. You have to take risks.
If she wasn't the girl perfect for me, god help me when I find that girl. She will be the most beautiful thing.

I just had a call to confirm the cancelled flights. It hurts :(.
It's not as bad as other breakups, because of the fact that we never touched.
I guess  I just miss the idea of a companion. Just someone to mentally connect with.
I know I'm still pretty young, but it still hurts all the same, You know?
I just wanted to get some feelings off my chest.
Thanks
I hope I didn't break any rules..

He has yet to get me anything, although we've made a plan on what he will get me. Our plan was to go to sephora together and he'd buy me $30 worth of products.

It sounded perfect to me. But we start to make plans before he gets his paycheck, and he always says he will have X amount left over for gas and my present. Yet every time he gets paid he doesn't have the money. He always says he is going to ask to borrow it from his parents/keep it from his paycheck but something always comes up and he can't take me.

I met this girl at college and after graduation we've been trying to stay together. I offered to pay for her airfaire if she wanted to come stay at my apartment for a few weeks. After several weeks of trying to settle on when this would happen she revealed that she's terrified of flying and doesn't want to spend a lot of time on public transport because she's a very small woman and she has agoraphobia. I told her I'd bus in and meet her halfway and she said that was still too far.           

I said I could come all the way, and she was a huge fan, and so we agreed to do that. About a week ago I asked where I'd be staying, and she told me I should stay at a local semi-inexpensive hotel, which boosted my trip cost to about $350 more than just the travel. I make quite a bit more than she does but I'm not a rich guy and that makes the entire trip cost about what I'd normally pay for a month of rent.           
I asked if she'd be willing to cover any of that, and she asked what the difference was between me paying to fly her to my apartment, and me paying the same amount of money to come down and see her. The difference, to me, is that the first option had us together at my apartment for as long as we wanted, and the second option has us in a shitty motel for four days, the 1st and 4th of which I'd be on the bus for 15 hours.          

I told her I could do it but that it'd be unlikely I could do this again in the near future because it's a lot of money. She had an anxiety attack and hasn't talked to me since (it's only been about 2 hours though).

I had made the awful mistake of still trying to remain friends with her after I broke up with her, we would message each over daily and have normal conversations however eventually she started getting upset about me quite a lot and I realized the chats were really making things worse for her.


Recently she became very aggressive, bitter, rude and mean to me. The first thing she did was say ""What happens is you never see me again, What if I disappear?"" She then ""Disappeared"" for a day eventually she came back and try to start an argument with me which I Ignored.


Later the next day she posted ""I could be on Suicides door and you wouldn't care."" So I messaged her asking what is up, and I talked to her about her problems trying to help, So I agreed and I tried to help her, her main problems was that she felt alone and like none of her friends wanted to talk to her, she felt she couldn't get a Job and maybe a future, I tried everything I could to assure her she would be fine and gave her lots of advice, I asked her why she posted she could be on suicides door she replied ""I'm not suicidal, but I don't see no future."" I continued to give her advice for around 1 and a half hours, eventually she starts to turn everything into an argument.


She started by saying ""I only gave things two weeks, I gave up and all the nice things didn't mean anything to her"".* (Im sugar coating this, and for background I actually gave it around two months, I wasn't happy with her for at least two months and I tried but eventually I saw things getting worse with no hope)
* I just replied saying, ""What am I suppose to say?"" I didn't really want an argument at this time. The argument continued for a while and then I suggested that we should have some space from each over for a month or two, I felt it maybe best as obviously things were not going to great, I told her however I'd still be here for her and I we can still talk occasionally just not as much. 

She kind just said ""Yep thats fine."" But she didn't really mean it, she said it didn't matter because I had lost all interest in her, she then went on to ask if I had used her* (I hadn't and I never would)* so I said I didn't. I then asked her again if she felt space would be best she said she didn't know and our whole relationship was a waste of time.

I then just said ""How can I help you?"" She replied ""You can't. I can't help myself either. You don't need to help me."" She then went on to continue saying how she was never special to me. (Which isnt true) We then agreed on some points of her space i told her I'd be here for her and I dont want her to disappear or ignore me if I do message her or anything. She just replied ""Okay"" didn't really have any input on it.

She then made things a lot worse,  She started it by saying ""What did you say to your friends about why you broke up?"" I said ""I told them things didn't work out"" she replied ""Well you should've said you gave up on me and never tried"". *(this is sugar coated)*

At this point I had enough, I realized that her intention was just to cause an argument so I told her that I was off to sleep. She said ""No don't F*Cking leave me now"" I said ""Why?"" she said ""Your not in f*cking control"", I replied ""Well what do you want me to do?"" she said ""Well why are you going offline?"" I said ""Because to be honest you have upset me a lot, I have been kind and helpful to you tonight but you have been bitter and offensive towards me.""

She then said ""You have no idea how I feel, I hate you so much. So go on, Go away. I'm sorry I hurt you. I'm sorry I was so hard to fucking love. I'm sorry."" I said ""This makes two of us cause you have no idea how I feel neither, but at least I tried to help you."" then she says ""Why are you so heartless?"" I then just said ""Please stop this now."" she said ""When will I hear from you again?"" I said ""When you stop hurting me like this."" She said ""Why is it always about you?"" I said ""I tried everything to help you but you just try to hurt me"" She said ""I have never cried so much in my life, its always about how YOU are hurt"". I said ""I spent 2 hours trying to help you, how is this about me?"" she said ""Can't you see its because Im depressed and hurt I am acting this way. Why are you so easily hurt?"" I then said ""Im depressed and hurt aswell. Its not just you. Good Night."" She then said ""But your moving on James. Im not. Good night.""

I then went to bed crying. Around an hour later she messaged me saying ""I realized now we loved eachover but I loved you more. (She went onto say the events of our breakup and her understanding of it, she was very calm and very accurate in her message. She described how she felt and how she always felt even when I broke up with her she didn't believe it was the end she thought I would come back to her) She ended the message with ""We talk now and I know there is something missing. Bye bye James."" I didn't know what to say so I replied ""Take Care."" She replied ""Good Night."" 

That is it. **(Everyone of her parts was very sugarcoated for reddit)**

I really fear for her life. Even though she said she was not suicidal she is not going through a good time of it. Its driving me crazy, I had contacted one of her friends about her situation yet she seems to be very busy or doesn't care enough to help her. I almost feel as if her ""Bye Bye James"" message was her final goodbye and this worries me. If she committed suicide I'd completely blame myself. Infact I have been so paranoid and worried about her I have almost had a mental breakdown and I have had occasional suicidal thoughts. I really do not know how to help her anymore, did I do the right thing? What do i do?

She loves me just as much. It's healthy and beneficial for both of us. 
We met during my junior/her senior year in high school (boarding school,
 far from both of our home states) and in a few short weeks she 
leaves for college. She's home right now visiting her parents 
(several states away) and I'm home waiting for my senior year to begin.


I love this girl. L has brought benefit and love to my life...things I never imagined I would have. I am her first real boyfriend. She is far from my first girlfriend. She is going to be attending a college that is several states away from our high school, and we both knew that we would have to continue our relationship. We have to. Both of us hate the idea of losing the other. Here's the issue:


I worry that, because I am her first boyfriend, I only *seem* like the amazing boyfriend she constantly tells me I am. I worry that I only draw her in so much because she never knew what it was like to have a real boyfriend who cares about her. Once she's in college, she will have access to a plethora of men, many older than I, and potentially superior boyfriend material. This thought sickens me. I *love* L. I really, really do, but I cannot shake this fear. Is it really irrational? 


L and I have been together for 7 months. Towards the beginning of the relationship, she was very dishonest with me about many things. Little, insignificant things mostly. However, at one point, we were hanging out and we both met a local guy who was willing to buy us alcohol consistently, so I saved his number. I later realized that she has a problem with alcohol, and she snooped through my phone to take his number. I later discovered that she texted him and told him he was cute and covered up her tracks. This was very early on in our relationship, and she later admitted it to me AFTER being confronted about it.


L's mom said that L has always been a pathological liar, and this doesn't surprise me. Lately, as in the last couple months, she has been much, much better about it. I'm sure there are still small white lies here and there, but nothing too unhealthy. Atleast, that's what it seems like. She clearly genuinely loves me and wants to be with me. But how can I shake this paranoia? How can I truly trust her while she's away? I will be attending college in the same city as her in one year. We plan on waiting for each other and visiting as often as possible (which will only realistically be a couple weeks total throughout this entire year).


More elaboration is necessary on the alcohol problem. I was talking to her a month or so back, and was expressing my concern about her cheating on me in college. She told me that she would never, ever have sex with another man, and that the only even potentially conceivable worst-case scenario is that she would get drunk and make out with some douche bag. She said this could only **ever** happen if she was drunk. I told her that the only way I could stay with her and maintain my sanity during this year would be if she agrees to stay completely sober from alcohol. She agreed without hesitation, and I am very confident that she hasn't broken that since Summer break began. But maybe that's because she's been with her family during the break. Maybe in college, when alcohol is easily accessible, along with horny, manipulative assholes, she will drink and fuck up. That would destroy me.


One more detail. I grew up in a really shitty environment (not gonna elaborate too much on this) and I have every reason to be paranoid about every single person in my life. It's a shock I have any trust in anybody. I know this is contributing to my paranoia, but how much of this is irrational? How do I stay sane while we're away?

For the most part, we have a pretty open line of communication, and a good relationship, but some things have come up the past month that are making me question everything (including my sanity).

For as long as I have known him, my boyfriend dips (chewing tobacco). I have pestered him to stop for a long time, bought him the tobacco-less dip to help him try to kick the habit. I hadnt seen any cans for a long time, and he hadnt mentioned it, so I thought it was done.  About two weeks ago, I found an e-cig. I didnt know he picked that habit up. He never mentioned it to me. When I asked him when he started/why he didnt tell me, his response was he picked it up because I wanted him to stop dipping, and hed been doing it for awhile now. He told me he didnt tell me because he knew id be upset.

Well obviously I didnt want him to quit dipping so he could pick up another bad habit. (I dont care about the debate that e-cigs are better for you, Its still a bad habit.) Anyways, I was upset. I tell him everything, he knows everything about my life and it made me question if there was anything else he doesnt tell me.

Fast forward to today. I was using his laptop to watch a TV show that he had downloaded. After it was over, I went to go on facebook. When the page loaded, it wasnt signed into either of our separate accounts, but was basically signed into a fake account. It was not a totally set up page, as it was asking for a confirmation email from a throwaway email account. There were no pictures, but it definitely was a fake account. My first thought is ""wtf is this?"" That led my thoughts to spiral into the ""is he cheating, how do you even cheat on facebook, am I overreacting?"" 

I am with him almost all the time. I know his school schedule and his work schedule is the same five days a week. If he is cheating, the only time I think it would be is when I have to work every other weekend. So I come looking for advice. Am I overreacting by jumping to conclusions? Does it really seem like something is going on behind my back, because he clearly doesnt seem to mind keeping things from me? And how best to approach this? I will not see him until tonight, and my first thought was to text him about it, but I dont think thats the best approach.

We're going to be together doing research at our college and have been talking about things to do on the weekend when we have time off. One of the places she's never been too is NYC, which she is dying to go to, but me being from NYC realizes we would need to stay at least overnight there to properly do some things (college is a few hours away).We're extremely happy with each other and have talked more about going to NYC especially since my sister lives there and could house us for the weekend, but now she's having doubts whether taking an overnight trip is good because she said it's pretty serious and would be jumping into things. FWIW I've met and had dinner with her mother (and gf) recently already who really likes and trusts me, which was a really big deal for gf and we both love each other. She also can be pretty uptight and in general strongly dislikes staying in new places overnight (told me before she's uncomfortable staying anywhere new overnight besides at college or her home) so I'm not sure if this is more about her thinking an overnight trip now is a huge step or she's just really anxious. 

So is taking an overnight trip a huge step having dated for 2 months (would be 3 when we actutally go to NYC) or is gf just really nervous about staying over somewhere different? Any tips on allaying her worries?

Our relationship had been deteriorating, and I had completely lost myself and was miserable.

We have an appointment for couples therapy in two days. 

Tonight however, he suddenly disappeared and his phone has been off all night. Roommates of his (acquaintances of mine) had contacted me telling me that he had been cheating on me, but he convinced me that they were lying as they do not like him and are trying to force us apart (a plausible scenario, they are very immature and would feasibly do something like that to make him miserable). I believed him. But on a hunch tonight, I created a fake login to OKcupid and punched in some of his stats. His profile was the first to pop up, in which he described himself as single, recently out of a long term relationship, and looking for short term dating. His last login was today at 4:30PM (shortly before he leaves work).

A little background, I (F32) have been with my boyfriend (M41) for 5 years. We have an 19 month old daughter together and bought a house at the start of this year. When we started dating we were living 300 miles from each other, so to make it work I moved to where he lived. I work as a nurse and was initially able to get some locum work in his area but it was unsecure and sporadic. I was quite down about not having a steady income and working in different a different clinical setting each time I got called to work.

A year into me living there, I got a fantastic full time job in a trauma ICU but it was 50 miles away. It was typical nursing 12-13 hour shift work, so it required me to be up at 5:30am and I wasn't home till 9:30pm. Everything was going great but I was finding the commute hard, as the roads are pretty bad where we live. In mid 2012 I became pregnant and damn it, how I didn't crash the car all that time, I was so tired. Our daughter was born in early 2013 and our relationship went from strength to strength. We both really wanted to become parents.

Things turned when I asked him if we could move closer to my job. I just couldn't be a mom and do the driving I was doing. We were talking about buying a house - my BF has a significant amount of money saved up and we were looking around at houses in the area we were living. We agreed it would be best if we started looking closer to where I worked. He was able to transfer his work so it seemed like the logical solution. 

On my maternity leave I found loads of fantastic houses, right price ranges, good size and beside great schools etc. Here comes the drama, my BF became so difficult and negative about buying a house and the move. No houses we looked at were right. It was so stressful, as I was due to go back to work, still needed a childminder organised and we were still renting 50 miles away. I had to request 3 months unpaid leave just to find a house he might of liked, which left me smashed broke. He kept choosing cheaper houses a little further out from my job and in really bad areas. But he liked them because he wouldn't have to spend so much on a deposit. One of the areas he wanted to buy in had recently had a petrol bomb thrown in the windows of one the neighbours house, it was that rough. The mind boggled, he is incredibly stubborn and I was left in a difficult situation where time to move house was running out. Also it was hard to argue with him as I felt guilty, as it was not my money that was being used as a deposit. I would like to point out that my BF is not the most sociable creatures so it wasn't like I was moving him away from a great set of friends or family he would see regularly. There was absolutely no work going for me in the small town where he is from so I couldn't of changed jobs. Yet he kept referring that there was great value in houses in the town he was from. 

I had been spending a shocking amount of money on fuel for the car from driving to work, before I had our daughter and the road is notorious for accidents. So far this year there was been 3 fatalities on that road and currently there is patient with a head injury in my unit from an RTA on that very road. He is aware of that as the road regularly makes the headlines the news.

So last minute before I was due to go back to work we buy what I think is a fantastic house, in a safe area and move in the week I am due back. The house needed a lot of cosmetic work done but I never shy from a challenge. It was going cheap, half the price of houses in the area. My BF just saw work and a shabby house that will cost more money to fix. Also the local economy was picking up and we noticing house prices were on the rise.  We are here 9 months now and the place looks great and I know in time will get better as I go along decorating/painting with whatever money I save up. Plus the house has gone up in 50k since we first agreed on the sale. My dad gave us all the furniture we have, so there was no extra costs. We had to replace all the windows - once again with bf's money. Again I feel guilty but he insisted I order them and I sussed out the best and cheapest deal but not without the odd sly and bitter mumble from him.

Fast forward to two months ago we booked a holiday for all 3 of us to go away to the sun. My BF offered to pay for the whole thing, which I thought was unusual but then I know him and guessed this was his way of being romantic and he's going to propose to me. I was right, he did! I was ecstatic and couldn't be happier. Since then I have had only one weekend off from work to go ring shopping and I was very conscious to pick something that didn't cost an arm and a leg. I hunted down a ring on the net and within the budget he gave me (2k).

Yesterday I was just finished doing a lot of night shifts in a row and the previous week I was back home visiting my parents, so it's been a while since we have been amorous. So last night I snuggled up to him trying to initiate sex. I get turned down and told we only have sex when I want it and on my terms. I am like wtf? We hardly ever see each other due to my hectic shift work and I agree that we just do not have enough sex as a result of that. He then proceeds to tell me I take him for granted, he's paid for so much and the holiday he is still paying off on his credit card monthly (he's still got a significant amount of savings) and said ""oh yeah the ring, forgot about that one"", and rolls his eyes up to heaven because it's just another expense.

 I feel like I am stuck in a relationship with a man who is bitter with me, thinks I am sucking him dry of his money (we pay 50/50 on everything and I do all household choirs with no complaint). I didn't ask for the holiday or engagement. In fact I told him to not bother with the ring. He is constantly taking swipes about how much he has spent. 

I went online today and transferred my half of the cost of the holiday to his account. His bank statement is just lying around so I used that to get his account number. I see he has 3k in his ordinary account from wages building up and I am now -270 and in my overdraft. I never wanted to be proposed, especially in a bitter way. As for the house.... I keep thinking if we bought where he was from he would be happy as a pig in shit. I'm stuck in a sexless relationship, with baby, a mortgage and a man who thinks I use him for money. I don't know what to do or how to make him happy or if I am in the wrong? Maybe I shouldn't of pushed for us to of bought this house and excepted the commute or a cheaper houses in run-down areas? I can't stop crying...

TL;DR: Moved 300 miles to with bf, got a job in a town 50 miles away and started a family with him. We were looking at buying a house but bought near where I work instead of the town where he is from. He was able to transfer his work. He has savings and paid for house deposit and lets me know about it through sly remarks. He then takes me away on holiday, pays for it and proposes and now is bitter over the cost of that. I cancel engagement and transfer money into his account for cost of holiday. I feel I am stuck in a bitter relationship.

Background:
The problems that lead me to break things off is that I didn't feel like we had any good communication anymore, our main form of communication was texts, and the occasional phone call. We'd try to see each other every 6-8 weeks, but this past summer had really stretched that time since neither of us could settle on a plan. 

 We had been shooting ideas back and forth; he had suggested a trip with one of his friends  and his SO, but the problem was that I didn't feel comfortable spending time with people I didn't know on a vacation, so my ex called me a wet blanket leading us to have a big argument, becasuse it really hurt to be called that. 

Anyway I was feeling hurt and such from the big fight in the summer, that the day before we were going on a trip  that I had promised to go on, I bailed.He also later said that he wanted me to help him mourn on the trip, which I didn't know since he didn't really clearly explain that, so it was a complete failure on my part not know his needs and such. He asked if I wanted to break up, and the word yes came out, and I've been regretting it ever since. 

Now: The problem is that I've been trying to open communication with him, because I do really want to get back together. I've accepted blame for ending things, and I've given a few heart felt apologies, I've tried to explain what lead me to do what I did. The problem is that he thinks my apologies are lame, that they are just me talking about my feelings, and that they are excuses. 

He also wants me to send him dirty pictures as reparations for what happened, but these pictures won't guarantee us working on things.  I've told him in the past when we were together, and now that dirties make me feel really objectified and uncomfortable, but that I would send him tamer pictures (like me in a bathing suit, or covering my lady bits with a towel ).

I think he's starting to date new people, and when I ask him if he wants to work on things, or not  he says that I'm making demands. I've also suggested seeing a relationship counselor in the past whe we were together, and he said it was an excuse to blame him, and that counselors always side with the ladies.  I've also talked to my shrink about this situation, and he suggested a relationship report card, when I suggested it to the ex, he said I was making another demand. 

Please help! Because I don't think I can live in this limbo anymore

71282,Relationships,27x8s7,"I'm really not sure where to begin... we have been dating for 2 years now and it has definitely been a lot of work to get here. 

To begin I guess I want to state that after a few months into our relationship we have had problems with sex. It had seemed I had a much higher libido than my boyfriend. 

After about a year and a half into our relationship my boyfriend begins to flirt with a much younger girl (17) to the point where he said it seemed like he had two girlfriends. There was nothing physical, but they met and talked frequently. Within a month or so of this, he confessed to me what he had been doing. I was absolutely devastated. I couldn't believe that my boyfriend had strayed, that this had happened to me. That he had lost interest in me and saw interest in someone else. I wasn't sure what to do and he wasn't sure either. It was clear he wanted to experience other people. But... I forgave him and we stayed together. He cut all contact her.

About 3 months after this incident, my boyfriend tells me he has been talking to another girl but just wants to be friends. He talked on the phone with her for an hour and this got me very upset but he reassured me that it was nothing like that and that he loved me and wanted me to trust him. I also wanted to trust him so I told him that I do trust him etc etc. Turns out he was trying to manipulate me and this girl to try and get into a threesome (big thing on his bucket list. Probably #1) He also slightly flirted with this girl as well. Again I was in absolute tears. It proved he was bored with me. That I did not spark his interest sexually. We almost broke up because of this as well... He cut contact with this girl too. I told him one more time like this and we're done. No more chances. 

4 months later, he goes to a big party (I could not attend due to family matters) and he tells me that at the party two girls started going at it in front of him, one of the girls began to suck his finger and then he groped her. I wanted to leave him. I wanted the strength to leave him. But I couldn't. I love him so much and I know he loves me. He regrets all the things he's done but its so many mistakes and made me cry endlessly. 

A couple weeks after that he straight up tells me I am not interesting in bed. I have a high libido and I get upset when I haven't had sex in more than 3 days (so I always want it) and tells me I'm easy and therefore uninteresting. He said everything is good about me but the sex. Sex is a big part of a relationship and its definitely a big part for me. I don't know what to do. It makes me sad that he'd rather go for other people rather than try to work with what we have. We are happy right now and I want to be happy but these events haunt me and I know it will haunt me for as long as we are together and I have accepted that.

I know I'm being stupid and I should have left long ago to save me heartache but I love him a lot. I guess I should mention he's my real first love. He says I'm his too but I don't really believe him.... He tells me I'm the best thing that's happened to him but why is he so unfaithful?

When and Eric started making wedding plans we always agreed that Jackie would not be invited. Jackie has been dating Micheal for a little over a year. when they started dating I was very excited that we were going to have another couple to hang out with. That didn't happen obviously. When i first met her at one of their family parties she completely ignored me when I tried to talk to her, straight up pretended I was not there. 

Since that day I have made countless attempts to invite them to do things with us always met with some excuses or maybes that turn into sorry I can't. In person she looses her smile when I am around, pretends I am not there or makes backhanded comments. Example: I really love to wear make up and sometimes wear bright colored pink or red lipstick. Me and my MIL were talking while I was doing my makeup at the kitchen table and I said I really love makeup and bright pinks. MIL said I like nude lipsticks or a lipgloss and very bright eyeshadow. SIL was also sitting at the table and said ""Pretty girls dont have to wear bright lipstick."" cue condescending laugh and a quick glance and smile at me. its things like that all the time. Not to mention I just don't get a good vibe from her, we text and pretend to be friends and okay with each other but its so fake I hate it.

so this morning my MIL was helping me with invites for the wedding that MIL and FIL are paying for the reception, (something small in the backyard. We are getting married by the state(only 15 ppl allowed) we were discussing who to invite and somehow it came up that I was fine with Jackie coming to the reception but she was not invited to the ceremony. MIL said things like well maybe she will work that day or well we'll see when the day comes and I told her ""no she will not be at the reception.""

she then started saying things like you are spoiled and you can't let other people bother you and she is part of the family if she doesn't come neither does Micheal and I will not have this family torn apart. I just kept calmly telling her I'm sorry but she will not be at the ceremony. this goes on an hour with her getting more and more angry until she gets up and starts yelling at me and grabbing her chair lifting it and slamming it down(in a stomping motion. angrily, not violently. as if to emphasize her angry loud words) while yelling she has to come, I'm spoiled, she is family, I don't have family so I don't know. getting louder and louder. this continues for 2 minutes then she storms out to the garage where FIL and Micheal are working on repairing the family van. I run upstairs to where my fiance is sleeping(he works nights) and wake him up and start crying telling him I'm scared, I know his dad is going to come yell at us and he is going to kick me out and to please back me up (in not inviting Jackie).

FIL comes upstairs and tells us come down now we need to talk, MIL is no longer hysterical or visibly upset only has a smug'you're gunna get it look' FIL and MIL lecture me and Eric and proceed to tell me I can not come into this family making demands and I'm not the ruler of anything and what am I trying to accomplish and that I don't know how proper families work because my mom abandoned me and i have no family. they proceed to tell my Fiance you can't put up with this, you have to tell her how things are going to be, put on your big boy pants and tell her whats what and when they asked him what he thought he stayed firm and said we decided this way back and we don't want to put up with her attitude.

BIL chimes in and says if there is no jackie there is no way I am going to be there. Another hour of the same and them telling me my family doesn't care about me and I should follow their rules since they are the ones that opened their home to me when my mom kicked me out. this whole time I stay mostly quiet because when I do squeak out a couple words about it being our day and I just want to be happy that day are met with eye rolls and look how spoiled she is, Its her day! she wants it her way!

They give us an ultimatum, invite her or no party and gifts from the family(money from the extended family) they will say sorry they don't want help they don't want a party. so me and my Fiance go upstairs to talk about it and he immediately says why do you have to be like this just ignore her, and I say but I won't be happy thats not what I want.

Its more than just me not liking her. She has rejected me and hurt me in backhanded ways constantly, she knows how to shake my very center and leave me feeling depleted like no one else can. I'm stuck. what do?

TL;DR super bitch SIL is not invited to state wedding ceremony and MIL and FIL say I'm breaking up the family and stop being spoiled.

This is so incredibly long, I'm really sorry...

**Background:** I've been dating my boyfriend for two and a half years. He's a fantastic, loving, caring boyfriend, super smart, very mature, fantastic chef, and we're perfectly suited for each other; we have similar goals, plans, hobbies, etc. We're committed to each other and are planning to live together after we graduate from undergrad. It's important to note that during the school year, we're long-distance; he goes to school on the East Coast and I'm in the West in our hometown, but we're blessed with funds/time/resources to visit each other about every three weeks, plus breaks, summer, etc. We make it work, and it works well for where we are right now.

**The family situation:** One of the things that initially drew me to him was the importance he places on family. When we started dating, his parents were still married, and his younger brother and younger sister were in high school and still lived at home. 

His dad is a high-profile medical researcher and a major workaholic. He had been sleeping in the guest room for about a year when we started dating; he claimed that this was because he had to get a good night's sleep to work efficiently. I thought this was a little off, but every family is different, so I didn't give it a second thought. He usually would leave the house at 5 a.m. to go to work, come home for dinner at 6 p.m., work through dinner, and then leave at 7 p.m. to go back to the office until midnight. He would pull many all-nighters, missed a lot of family events, and was just kind of checked out of anything that wasn't work. The one time that he could ""relax"" were their family vacations, which their whole family looks forward to and plans years in advance (just like mine, so I was glad this was important to my boyfriend!) but even on the vacations that I've gone on with them, his dad was/is always working, sending emails, writing grants, etc. He makes *a lot* of money doing what he does, and it pays for these vacations, so it seemed like it worked out.

For the record, I love his mom (she, 50sF, jokingly refers to me as her other daughter) and I love spending time with her. She's the warmest, most involved but un-helicopter-y, caring mom I've ever seen. My boyfriend and I have said that if we end up getting married and having kids, we both want to be the kind of parent she is. She's awesome.

**The separation:** Right before Christmas in 2012, my boyfriend called me the day before his last final before winter break, sobbing, and said that his parents just told him that they were separating. This hit him like a brick wall; I suspected that things weren't great between his parents but this was really out of left field for him. It turns out his mom had accidentally sent a text intended for her friend to my boyfriend's brother, saying that she and his dad were separating. His boyfriend was enraged that she hadn't told the kids, so he said she had 24 hours to tell my boyfriend and his little sister, or he would. His family does a group Skype every week, so that afternoon, they told my boyfriend but agreed to wait until after Christmas to tell his little sister. My boyfriend was devastated; everything he knew about his family narrative was crumbling. His dad was moving out, and his mom said that it was because, ""He was and is a great dad to you guys, but he just wasn't committed to being a husband."" Basically, she just said that he was checked out of the marriage and wasn't interested in working on it, so they were separating to figure out the next step. She refused to get into detail with it, and told the kids that if they wanted to know more, they could ask their dad, but she was really insistent that she and their dad would always be amicable, and would always love the kids and do what's best for them.

**The divorce:** Flash forward another year to right before Christmas 2013 (the timing on this is the worst) and my boyfriend calls me again, sobbing, that it turns out his parents are getting a divorce. He and I both saw this coming; his dad bought a new house, had totally moved into it, and had been no-contact with his mom for about six months. But then he goes into the reason for the whole split: his little sister is best friends with the daughter of one of his dad's colleagues, who let it slip that my boyfriend's dad had cheated on his mom with a co-worker. His little sister is now in the same position as his brother was, and tells her dad that if he doesn't fess up to her and the family in 24 hours, she'll tell everyone. Her dad counters that her mom knows, and it was the discovery of that relationship that led to the separation; his mom had kept silent about it because she wanted the kids to have a good relationship with their dad. But they realized it had to come out, so my boyfriend's mom broke it to the kids; their dad refused to participate in the conversation, choosing to email the kids a few days later about it. My boyfriend, obviously, was devastated, hurt, and so, so angry. The relationship had gone on for two and a half years; the co-worker in question knew their family, had been to their house for Christmas parties, and in a weird twist of fate, her daughter was a close friend of mine in high school. She's divorced and still has a daughter living at home. 

**The fall-out:** My boyfriend didn't talk to his dad for about a week, but as soon as he came home for winter break, they resumed their relationship ""as normal."" There's a palpable difference in the way they interact, and my boyfriend has refused to move in any of his stuff to his dad's house and doesn't like spending a lot of time there, but other than that, they're proceeding as usual. However, he's still really hurt about it and admits that things will never be the same, but he says that there's nothing his dad could say to make it better. His brother feels the same way. His sister is totally the talk-it-out kind of person, so she's been trying to work through it with him, but apparently he gets really defensive and blames their mom for causing him to go outside the marriage, so she shuts him down and drops it for the next little bit and then brings it up again when she feels like she needs to. All of the kids are immensely hurt about it, but they value having their dad in their life, and I totally understand why they're hesitant to delve into it more.

**The trip to France:** In the summer of 2012, before the separation, his family (super, super generously) invited me to come with them to France for two and a half weeks. I paid my airfare, but they paid (well, really his dad paid) for everything else. For the first week, we were in Paris with his mom and siblings while his dad was at a conference in Switzerland; he met up with us at the end of the week in Paris, and then we spent the next 10 days in the south of France, where we also met up with my boyfriend's uncle (60sM, mom's brother) and his family (wife 50sF, daughters 24F, 22F).

After he joined the trip, things got really stressful; the siblings fought more, he started being very controlling about where we ate, where we stayed, etc. My boyfriend's uncle's vacation home couldn't accommodate everyone; my boyfriend's parents were going to stay at a hotel in town. His dad kicked us out of the house at 11 p.m. on the second night, because the wifi wasn't good enough at the hotel and he had to work on a grant, so he was demanding to switch us rooms. We switched, respecting that he was paying for all of it, and he who pays the piper calls the tune, but on the inside, I was mildly upset about being ousted in the middle of the night to carry all of our stuff to a hotel, when we would have been happy to be there in the first place. This is part of my anxiety/issue with his dad: He's a terrible planner and doesn't understand why it's rude to switch plans on people at the last minute. He's notorious for being very last minute with his plans, which he makes without consulting anyone who he's including on them. 

On this same trip, we were waiting at the train station in Paris to catch our train to the south of France, when my boyfriend's dad decides that he wants to go see Napoleon's tomb and leaves without telling anyone. I should note that he hates waiting; he goes into a literal rage when he hits a stoplight, and punches his steering wheel and swears if he can't either make a right turn to get out of it, or if it doesn't change immediately. He's usually doing two things at once; he takes his Blackberry in the shower with him, in a plastic bag, so he can send emails while he showers. No minute is to ever be wasted, ever. 

I'm a lot more laid back, but I agree that when you're in another country for a limited amount of time and you've paid a lot to get there, you should use every minute wisely. However, he decided to leave the train station, dumping his luggage with us, and took my boyfriend's brother (who was the one who informed us, ""Dad just texted me and said he's on his way to Napoleon's tomb so I'm going to go meet up with him"") about *20 minutes* before the train was going to leave. Boarding a French train during the height of summer vacation season is like an apocalypse movie scene where everyone's scrambling to get out of dodge; everyone's pushing everyone, little old ladies are getting trampled, people are carrying suitcases over their heads, etc. It's nuts. Our train is called and we all start running towards it, carrying his luggage and the brother's luggage plus our own. When he finally gets on the train, at the last minute, my boyfriend's mom lets him know how upsetting it was that he would do that without telling anyone, and he gets angry that they weren't ""maximizing time"" and that he did tell the brother, so her point is moot and she's wrong to be upset. 

I can provide more examples of this kind of me-first-who-cares-what-anyone-else-feels behavior if anyone's interested, but I know this is getting way too long, so finally, here's my question...

**What brought this to a head:** His dad invited me to go with them for two weeks after Christmas to Greece and Turkey, two places that I've always dreamed about going. Same deal – if I pay my airfare, they'll pay for everything else. My boyfriend really wants me to come on the trip, and since I have limited time with him over breaks, I want to go just to be with him, too. His little sister begged me to come because she doesn't want to be the only woman. I figured that the opportunity was too good, that his dad is being hugely generous by bringing me along and that I could definitely tolerate and be friendly with him for two weeks (I make a point to always be civil and cordial, and *none* of this has ever been expressed verbally to anyone, except occasional, ""I know, I agree with you that whatever shitty thing your dad just did really sucks"" to my boyfriend) and that I should take the plunge, as it will be a great way for me to mature in my relationship with his dad, and that it will help me just get the fuck over my problems with him, which I know I need to do. I bought the ticket, non-refundable. Worst comes to worst, I can change the dates or get equivalent miles, but I've paid for it and can't really back out.

But I'm still having anxiety about it. I really, really struggle with him – partially out of anger for how he hurt my boyfriend, who idolized him; how he hurt his other two kids who are like a brother and sister to me, at really challenging points in their adolescence; how he totally cast aside his amazing wife who he's ridiculous not to have done so much better by; and for his childlike selfishness when it comes to interacting with others. But then I check myself, because he's paying for someone who's not related to him to come to Europe, just to make his son happy, and what could be more *selfless?* Then I tell myself I'm the one who has the problem; that I'm in this because I love my boyfriend and I support him, first and foremost, and I can't control other people, I can only control my reaction to them, and so really, like I said, I just need to get over it, put on a good face, thank him profusely for the amazing opportunity, and go. 

**Really, what I'm asking is:** Am I in the wrong to be upset by his dad's general way of handling things/dealing with other human beings, or am I the one being an asshole? If I'm not in the wrong, how do I cope with this? And if I am, how do I change to be a better, more supportive girlfriend to my boyfriend?

She still lives 2.5 hours a way, so we're still semi-long-distance, but it's not an outlandish idea for us to visit each other anymore. We talked daily while she was gone, sometimes writing for 3+ hours, but now that she's back she seems to have reverted back to her ""pre-Sweden"" self - doesn't have any interest in talking to me every day.

Now, of course we don't need to talk every day, but the abrupt change in her attitude since she's gotten back is a little startling. Before she left, we spent a lot of time together while she was in town for college, so we never really needed to message each other much - usually just a text to figure out when we would see each other. I personally loved talking to her everyday while she was away. Most of the time it you could say it was the highlight of my day!

When I asked her if she wouldn't mind putting aside maybe half an hour each day (possibly right before she goes to bed) to say hi and maybe chat a little bit, she accused me of being too needy. I personally don't think it's that unreasonable of a thing to ask, especially considering that she's living at home with no obligations like work or school right now.

Honestly, I'm a little hurt that she doesn't seem to want to talk to me, even for just a little bit every day. I've dated her long enough to know that her and her family like to keep to themselves and this wasn't unusual behavior for her before she left for Sweden, but I loved the way we communicated while she was away and I would really hate to go back to the way things were. Am I being selfish and unreasonable?

105894,Breakups,2i280k,"My ex broke up with me on August 20th...so it's been a bit over a month already, and I am finding it extremely hard to get over him and move on. I know 2 months is nothing when it comes to a relationship, but he was my first boyfriend and I've never been intimate with a guy before. Before him, I never even held hands with a guy...

Anyways...he broke up with me because one day I mentioned marriage...and I did apologize, but still I guess it wasn't enough. I didn't just randomly mention marriage, but he was talking about sex and I just suggested why not wait until marriage? I really value sex and any form of intimacy.  2 weeks later he broke it off with me. Since then I haven't heard from him. Also, even though I mentioned waiting until marriage, I did tell my ex that once we were together for at least 6 months then we could have sex. And before, he told me he was willing to wait. So...suddenly he just decided to change his mind and figured I wasn't worth the wait. I feel valueless and worthless.

For 3 weeks after he left me I tried to get back with him. I would email, text, and call him every now and then. Some days I wouldn't and some days I would. (Now I don't ever though, the last time I did was September 14th).

I just feel so miserable...I feel I've been waiting my whole life to have a boyfriend and for a guy to tell me he loves me (Which he did, multiple times), but in the end he couldn't care less. I even asked for his friendship which he ignored me as well as my other messages and attempts to contact him.

I feel really ashamed too. Even though we didn't have sex, we were intimate. We showered together before and made out multiple times. He's seen me naked as well as I've seen him. Lots of touching and kissing. And now to realize all those moments meant nothing to him...it makes me so sad. I feel valueless. No one has ever seen me naked before and I've never seen a naked man, everything was extremely important to me.

I still want to be with him...and I know he doesn't have anyone else, because he's always online that dating site we met on. I just can't believe he forgot me already. He never cared. He blocked my number and blocked me on facebook. The only reason I still even have my fb is the hope that one day I'll find out he unblocked me, because that means he thought of me. And maybe he'll try to contact me. But still....nothing, I am blocked.

It's so hard for me to realize the fact he doesn't care about me at all. The person who once was so affectionate and loving to me, now acts like I never existed. He doesn't care how I am coping.

I feel as if I can't ever be in a relationship again. I am having such a hard time getting over a short relationship....what if instead of 2 months, my next one is 2 years and then he leaves me? I don't know what I'd do. I want to love and be loved, but I now have such a fear of break up. I always feel anxious all the time; I can't relax. I also can't stop fantasizing about my ex. 



Like any human, I have sexual desires. And I really wanted to lose my virginity to him. Constantly I would have fantasies of that moment....and now, even though it's been over a month he left me...I still do have those fantasies.

I don't know how to move on. Dreaming that one day he'll come back to me is a hopeless dream. All I am to him is his 8th ex girlfriend, and he doesn't even remember me anymore.

I guess...all I am asking for is advice?

By all accounts we were pretty happy, no major disagreements. We've been through a lot, with several immediate family members passing while we were together. We had been quasi-long distance for the past few years, though the passion may have subsided the love was still deep and strong. At least on my end. He was the only person I had ever been with, both sexually and as far as serious relationships go. 

So my boyfriend of five years broke up with me about 7-8 weeks ago, citing the need to find himself and see what he really wanted, as well as saying he no longer felt that he was in love with me. That really sucked to hear, for the first two days it hurt to breathe knowing that someone I had been so totally invested in, no longer wanted me. I should also mention that this break up occurred about three months after my Dad had passed away, I hadn't really begun to deal with my Dad dying and then it was like something else had been ripped from me. 

--------------------------

Anyways, after those two days of heartbreak I started to feel a bit better, I started going out to bars, met a few guys, fooled around for about a week. Also around this time my friend had me make an OkCupid profile. One of the first guys that messaged me, lets call him H, was really nice and funny and wanted to meet me. So I did. We had a couple drinks and had a really fun time. We saw each other again, this time for dinner and a movie, and again had an awesome time. After that date, we started to see each other more regularly, he is smart and funny, cute with drive, ambition and passion. It hadn't been long that I realized I was starting to have genuine feelings for him, without realizing it I had opened up to him completely and been honest about my past and what I wanted for my future. Despite the short amount of time that has passed, our being completely open with each other has allowed some strong feelings to develop. I'm not saying we're head over heels in love, but he makes me feel special and beautiful and all of those things that they talk about in Disney movies. 

--------------------

This would be great except for one small thing... I had been sleeping with my ex regularly since we'd broken up, lets call him J. I don't know why I let it happen, I guess I was desperate to hold on to some part of my ex, and if all he wanted was sex that was enough for me. However it wasn't just sex, for all intents and purposes we were seeing each other. We'd go out for dinners, and do date-like activities. And eventually I guess my ex realized he was wrong about no longer being in love with me, that seeing me with confidence that came from myself and not him was very sexy. Now he hasn't out right asked me if I would be willing to get back together, but he has said that is what he 'thinks' he wants. He just isn't sure. 

--------------------------

So here I am, I haven't told H that I'm seeing my ex, but we also haven't had the exclusive talk yet. However I can feel that conversation coming very, very quickly. I don't know what to do, my ex wants me to wait for him but I don't want to give up something that I feel has the potential to be something amazing with H for a maybe from my ex. My ex was someone I wanted to marry once upon a time, and I still love him deeply but I don't know if I should tell H that I can't be with him and ruin that potential relationship for the chance that my ex wants me again. I feel like if I wait for my ex, that makes me pathetic and stupid and used and I could be giving up something awesome, but if I don't and J is 'the one' or H doesn't work out, then what?

I remember being confused and in disbelief the next day, but he said he meant it.

Flash forward to now. He never says ""I love you"" to me unless I say it first, and even on those few occasions, he kinda mumbles it as if he's embarrassed. I've cornered him on this topic before and he says he does love me, but he seems to prefer avoiding the topic.

With this current relationship, I love being around him, I miss him when he's gone, I'm turned on by him, and I love planning adventures with him. He complements me very well.

This time, the CC debt is twice as high and she can no longer make the monthly minimum payments with her own income after contributing to shared house expenses. (mortgage, water, electric, etc... Split down the middle.)


Without providing too much personal detail about my financials, this guy is experiencing nearly exactly the same thing: [Other Redditors Debt](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3ats2u/30yo_in_35k_cc_debt_need_game_plan/)


Seeing his post made me come forward and seek outside input. The only difference from my situation is the amount of debt and the fact that my wife doesn't have a business / business account. Exact same situation, though. Trusted that my wife was handling our shared accounts properly... only to find out recently this is not the case after needing to spend $300 on work on the house.


[First Instance] 
Roughly 1.5 years ago, my wife came forward about some CC debt that got out of hand. The strange thing about this is we had made a pledge to keep only one CC each with a relatively low maximum. Unknown to me, she had 4... and the total debt was $7,000. (She makes $30k / yr...) I was very understanding, did not use any harsh language or blow off at her. We talked about it, decided the best thing to do was to consolidate. She agreed to cut up the cards and only use her spare cash for extras.


This may be where I screwed up... I looked over our shared accounts and things appeared fine at this time. So, I trusted that all was well...


[Second Instance]
This is where we are today. One month ago, she comes out to me and says she's in trouble again. This time, I sat down... asked for all CC account logins / passwords and went through these statements myself. She now has a total of $13,000 in CC debt. That's right. She did not close those other CCs and accounts. She continued doing exactly what she promised she would not do. (She still makes the same $30,000 / yr.)


Now, I'm a very observant person. Our shared accounts, when we do extras or need things, I keep a mental tally on what's going on. (Usually pretty accurate, maybe $50 - $100 off... but close enough.) Our shared accounts are structured to where there is a checking (for bills), savings, and a second savings. Two safety nets. I made sure of this by depositing extra from my own pay to ensure a minimum amount was put back per month after all expenses. Even with that, I paid off my own vehicle 4 years early by saving my own spending money each month. Lowering our overall monthly expenses. Despite this, our shared account now has no savings, nor back-up savings. (emergency fund) It's all gone.


Anyway. This is where I am asking /r/relationships a few questions. I'm a very laid back spouse. I live frugally and drive an 11 year old vehicle that I do most of the maintenance on myself. My wife has a 1 year old car. She shops and buys the latest and greatest of most things. (I understand that women tend to shop more than men, I'm not knocking her for that.) However, I also know that this should be kept in moderation.


As for expenses, most of what I see is her blowing money on charities (when asked at the cash register), her family (mother/father/sister/brother), pets, and misc lady products. (expensive hair appointments, the 3,000 bottles of chemicals in our bathroom, etc...) 


She literally has nothing to show for it. She contributes nothing to our house outside of the monthly bills. All furniture, decor, lawn decor, lawn care, and even house cleaning is done by me. This is not an exaggeration. In the 5 years we have been in our house, she has not swept, or mopped the kitchen once. Nor any other room in the house. I do every thing. The only thing I ask of her is to cook... and I get complaints, even though I help with that too. Why is this significant? Because she has over 5 pets. These are pets I have to clean up after because she won't!


Since this is the second time with the CC debt, and this time, our shared account has been wrecked. I'm making demands. (I guess you can call it that, because that's what she says I'm doing.) We will not be taking steps towards consolidation or anything unless she takes actions on these initial steps. I've asked for all CCs be surrendered to me. All online shopping accounts seen on a CC statement will also be surrendered to me. (Changing logins, removing saved CCs, etc...) Debit card for her personal bank account. She will only get $100 cash per month for whatever. She can hold on to our shared account card, for gas and maybe help with grocery shopping. (I now monitor this every other day.) Last, but not least... She has to put one of the pets up for adoption. (One of the CCs has $800 in vet bills, that she can't even pay.) 


This is where we are stuck. She flat out refuses to understand the pet expenses. I'm being some kind of monster and unfair, according to her. She says I did a complete 180 from how I was the first time she wrecked her credit cards and that this time I'm not being fair. What did she expect? I figured the first time was just a mistake... I'm very forgiving... maybe that's where I messed up. I don't know. But this time, she's stepping into our shared finances. How am I suppose to trust her?


I have a right to know the conditions of our accounts before things get this bad. We agreed that she would handle the monthly bills/budget from the beginning. She simply kept that from me until we hit rock bottom. Every time (in the past) we came up short on a vacation or monthly budget, she would inform me of the situation and I would pay what was needed out of my own monthly spending cash. (Maybe this is another place I screwed up... she was more willing to spend extra because she never had to cover it.) I was only trying to be a good husband and allow my wife to have a bit of luxury. I even pay 100% of her health / dental / etc... and allow her to charge monthly gas expenses for her vehicle to our shared account. I pay for my own gas/oil etc.

Excuse the poorly written wall of text. I've been trying to organize this situation in my mind for a month... can't seem to do it. There is a lot more missing from this post, but any advice would be great.  This is a decent summary.


**[Quick Edit]** ""The pet thing is directly related to the $800 in vet/pet care expenses sitting on one of her cards. This pet specifically is very high maintenance. (Doesn't shed, requires professional grooming, big animal, eats a lot, etc...) Secondly, she does not have time to spend with it. Given the number of pets we have... this one just sits in a crate roughly 20 hours a day. It's a destructive animal, too. So much repair and money has gone into fixing things it's destroyed.
And yes... I have taken control of all our finances.


**Edit:** But honestly... am I being that big of a monster here? I understand you commit to pets... but we can't continue to shoulder such high expenses for PETS. The compromise is only ONE, the largest expense of them all... going up for adoption. This will benefit the pet and help with our own expenses.""


**tl;dr**: Wife hits $7k secretly in CC debt. Comes out. We consolidate. She promises to cut up the CCs. One year later, she comes out again this time with $13,000 in CC debt and has drained our shared accounts dry. Many words....

25054,Non-Romantic,2dxri5,"This might get kinda complicated but I'll try to make it as short and simple as possible.

Me and three friends (all 21 now) have been a group since freshman year of high school. 7 years later the four of us are still friends and although we went to different colleges we all make an effort to see each other as frequently as possible during our school breaks when we're all in our hometown.

However, one of our friends (I'll call her Ali) has been slacking on that effort for quite a while now. While we all live in the US, her family's cultural background means that she has a huge family that are all very close. She's always been the one who was first to cancel/postpone plans and usually it's because she has some family thing that just came up - and that's part of the annoyance, that it's usually pretty sudden with very little notice.

The other three of us (I'll call one of them Beth and one Cathy) have been discussing this issue all this summer. We're constantly complaining about how annoyed we are and we've discussed telling Ali off multiple times, but then she'll actually hang out with us and we won't say anything because we don't want to drive her away even more.

Here's a few specific examples:

1) Beth experienced the death of a close family member around a holiday. This holiday also happened to be Ali's 21st birthday while the rest of us were still 20. Ali insisted on going out to bars with Darla (her friend who isn't friends with the rest of us) instead of hanging out at Beth's house to keep her company during a time that she needed us. The kicker - Beth was going out of the country the day after that holiday and Ali hadn't seen her since the memorial for Beth's family member (like two weeks earlier).

2) My 21st birthday was about 2 months after we all got back from college. We went to dinner the first weekend we were all home and I told them I was going to rent a hotel room in the town I went to college so I could show them around and we could go to the bars together. She ended up canceling only days before we were supposed to leave (after the hotel had been booked for over a month) because she couldn't get off work. She claimed that her manager *only* scheduled her on the days she asked off, and says she told him two weeks beforehand but I'm not sure I believe either of those things.

3) Most recently, we made plans to go to dinner and see a movie. She texts us the day of and says she has to go to dinner with a family member since this was the last time she could see them before she left for college. She said she could still go to the movie, but she was bringing Darla because Ali doesn't have a license yet and she needed a ride. She shows up to the movie after the trailers are over and said she couldn't come back to my house after because she had to go home with Darla (Ali and I live in the same neighborhood and it takes 2 minutes for me to drive her home). We got to talk to her for maybe 10 minutes in the lobby while Darla awkwardly stood 3 feet away on her phone. Cathy told me later that Ali didn't even hug her goodbye when she left. Ali then asks my work schedule and says that we can hang out tonight (Monday). When I texted our group text about it, Beth said she couldn't anymore and Ali didn't respond. I texted her directly and she said she didn't think we were doing anything since Beth couldn't. I asked why we couldn't hang out just the two of us and told her today was the only day I could do it because of my work schedule and plans to go out of state this weekend - by the time I get back from that Ali will be back at college. She never responded.

Basically, she constantly flakes on our plans, but usually has what appears to be a legitimate excuse. Often she simply won't respond, even tho whenever we hang out she's constantly on her phone and even answers calls while we're all driving somewhere and were in the middle of talking.

We did stop inviting her to events as much, and then she would get mad when she found out about them.

We don't want to lose a friend but it's getting absolutely ridiculous at this point. What would you do in this situation? Cut contact? Tell her off/explain the problem? Stop inviting her but still talk and hang out if she invited us (although she also cancels on plans she initiates)?

TL;DR - I have a super flaky friend who doesn't seem to care or put effort into our friendship anymore. What's the best course of action here?

53339,Relationships,2mh381,"Me and Suzie (fake name obviously) met 2 months ago, we instantly hit it off but I was involved with another girl, anyway that ended and Suzie messaged me on a night out asking where I was, we met in the club, kissed and went back to her place together (we only live 1 minute away from each other). 

I don't think either of us thought things would progress the way they have but we're exclusive now. 

Now the main issue: She was in a 5 year relationship up until the summer and the only reason the relationship ended was because they were going to different universities. I've known this since I met her but figured I like her and there's nothing I can do about her past. She literally never brings her ex up, I don't know what he looks like or his name, she only told me about him because I was joking about how quickly she'd got me into her room and she said she isn't normally this kind of person but it was justified as she was just out of a 5 year relationship

She's going home next weekend and found out her ex is going back home too and she said it's thrown her. She told me she really likes me and she'd forgotten about him pretty much completely (they weren't in contact), but after he messaged her telling her he's going back at the same time it's thrown her a bit and she isn't sure how she feels, they're probably going to meet up for a catch up because Suzie claims they were such a big part of each other's life that it isn't fair to just ignore him and act as though nothing had happened. She said she was telling me this because while she likes me and hasn't really thought about him she isn't sure how she's going to feel when she actually sees him again, so she said she doesn't want to hurt me or anything and feels like I deserve to know in case I want to end things because of being uncomfortable with being in this situation.

I'm not going to kid myself, no matter how well I feel this is going, we've only known each other for 2 months and they had a 5 year relationship together. So what they have was a much bigger part in her life than the current relationship.

I mean I never planned on things getting this far between us. I've wondered a little if this is a rebound thing for her, but she didn't seem to be in any rush to get into a relationship at uni. Also I don't know if things will last, I mean she's 18 years old and hasn't been single for more than a couple of months since she was 13, she told me she let herself go a little at university before we got together (didn't sleep with anyone though) so even though things are great between us I can't help but feel she's going to want to try other things eventually, but maybe not and I'm just worrying about a non-existent issue.

I trust her not to do anything with her ex when they meet up, but I'm afraid it might spark something back up and she decides she still loves him so we won't work, after all it was a 5 year relationship which wouldn't have ended if it wasn't for university.

I guess I'm just a little unsure on the whole thing so I want some outside opinions. I like her so I don't want to end things and I think I'll see what happens, but I am weary about what's going to happen.

103460,Infidelity,1p1dfh,"For years before I met my wife, I would always find myself in situations where I would be inappropriate with the opposite sex. It was usually a work relationship that started off with causual flirting. This was fine when I was single, but then I met the girl of my dreams, got engaged, got married and had a child.

I was recently discovered by my wife for cheating on her emotionally and once physically (more about that in a bit). For the first couple of months, I wasn't honest. I told half truths and downplayed the fanasies in my head that I had about these other women.  I basically made it worse. She kept finding out more and more, and if I would have been honest at the start, we would have been a lot better off.

For the record, I never slept with or kissed any of them. At the end though before I was discovered, I did groped a women's breast and that lead to me getting caught.

At first, I was scared to get caught, but since then, I really feel being caught has been the absolutely the best thing that has ever happened in my life. I've realized that I have addictive tendancies, that I escape realtiy with fantasy, and that I wasn't present in my relationship with my wife or any of my friends or family. Since then, I've been going to a therapist, going to SAA meetings, and really learning a lot about myself. Most importantly, I've learned that I'm not the only one who has these issues. I even told my wfe how good I've felt about me, but she doesn't want to hear it because her pain only started when mine was getting fixed.

My wife is a rollercoaster of emotion. She has gone through disbelief, extreme sadness, extreme anger (to the point of physically assulting me on several occasions), to happy and hopeful, back to angry and confused. I keep hoping that we've made the turn and that we're on a positive streak, but ultimately she is always brought back to the same feelings of insecurity and hatred for these other women who frankly had very little to do with my issues. 

I put myself before my wife and child. I wasn't helpful around the house. I wasn't a good husband. I apeared to be a great guy to all our friends and family, but really I was leading a secret life. I got highs from doing bad things, and sneaking around. I even would find myself intentionally trying to get drunk in order to lower my self control so that something more would happen. Again, I never slept with or kissed any women, but if they would have, I wouldn't have stopped them.

So here we are today, months later, and I'm losing some hope that my wife has the strength to keep faith in me. She is calling me names, trying to insult/hurt me, and reminding me how much she hates her life because of what I've done to her. 

I have tried a lot including telling her I would be willing to move back to her hometown (1000s of miles away) to be clsoer to her family, that I will never put our relationship in a position where I may act out like this again, and that I love her and our family more than anything in the world.

But she can't take it. Her mind wonders all day at work. She thinks the worst. She searches for clues. She thinks there's more I'm not telling her. She is having me take a polygraph at some point, which we both know I'll pass, but she feels that it won't ask the right questions. She wants to know who I've masterbated to, who I've fantasized about, who I've thought about naked, etc. She wants to know how dark the place I was in really was.

At this point, my close friend is preparing me for the worst. He's telling me I need to be prepared that she may file for divorce and that I can't lose it if she does because my child needs a father.

So, reddit, I've been coming to you and trying to help others for years, but I need your help now. I've gotten advice from a couple friends, my parents, therapist, and other people who are like me, but I would like to hear what others who have been on both sides of an affair have to say.

Thank you for your time and any comments.

1711,Breakups,3culji,"Our relationship was great for the first 2.5 years but something changed with her. We would always talk about getting married, maybe having a family, how weird our kids would be. But a year ago something happened and we didn't do that any more. She said she loved me but was no longer in love with me. About 1 month ago we almost broke up because she missed seeing other people and missed the variety and getting to know someone. I compromised and we started an open relationship because I didn't want to lose her. That went better than expected in that I wasn't jealous or sad like I thought I would be. Our relationship seemed to be getting better and in a way it seemed like even though we were further apart in some sense we felt closer together.

Fast forward to last night. We went out and had a picnic in a really beautiful spot on the river. I thought things were going well all things considered. She said she wasn't happy being in a relationship and misses her freedom. She said she still loved me and I was her best friend but her heart wasn't in it anymore. We came home and talked some more, laughed, and cried. We live with my parents which complicates things a bit and we discussed maybe moving out and being room mates or something or her staying until August or December. All those sounded great because even though I knew it was over, I would still have her in my life to some extent.

She went to sleep and I went to hang out with my best friend and tell him what was going on and about the idea or her living with me even though we weren't together. He explained that it would be like taking out an emotional loan. I owe some hurt and sadness  now but if I prolong it, I would pay more in the end. It made a lot of sense and I figured it would be better to rip the bandaid off now than slowly pull it off over the next few months.

This morning she went to work and called me at around 11am and asked what I wanted to do. Just about every fiber of my being wanted to tell her to stay for a few months but I said it might be better off if she moves out today. She sounded like she wanted to stay longer too but agreed that it would be better to get it over with. She just moved most of her stuff out an hour ago and I am miserable. I see pictures of her, or stuff she left behind and I miss her and what we had. I'm afraid I'll never have anything as good as what we had ever again. I have a pit in my stomach and I can't stop thinking about her. Every time my phone vibrates I hope it is her texting me that she made a mistake, but I don't think that will happen.

I want to start by saying that I love my girlfriend and that she is one of the sweetest and gentile people I know.  We've been together for a little more than a year. 

Recently though, Shelly has been hit hard with some anxieties about her job performance and the fact that some of our friends, who have been dating much longer than we have, are getting married.  Because of the anxiety, shelly's avoided her office (she can work from home) and our friends, which is difficult because I share an apartment with two of our engaged friends and our's is one of the places we hang out as a group. 

Shelly even had some anxiety last night about a triple date we went on with her sister and cousin and their boyfriends.  She even flipped out on me because, while I was trying to convince her that we were going to have a great time, I said that her sister was hilarious.  Shelly went on to tell me that she's worried that I would leave her for her sister and before we went into the restaurant she admitted to me that she hates how her sister always gets what she wants by doing the ""wrong things"" and feels like she does all the right things but results don't come as easily for her.  (Ex: she feels like her sister dresses borderline inappropriately to get ahead at work while she's working her ass off and isn't seeing the same results)  Shelly has also put on a few pounds despite the fact that she has started working out like crazy and feels defeated because she isn't seeing any results there.


Despite how many times I tell Shelly that she's perfect and that I wouldn't change a thing about her or ever consider leaving her for her sister or anyone else, she can't get these negative thoughts out of her head. I should mention here that Shelly's last two boyfriends cheated on her and I know that's not an easy thing to get over so I'm trying my best to be as compassionate as possible. 

The problem I'm having is that the only thing that seems to set my girlfriend's anxiety at ease is being with me, which in and of itself isn't bad at all. The problem is that Shelly requires my constant attention while we're together. This means that if we're together cooking, that doesn't count. Or if we go to a movie, that doesn't count. Shelly needs me to hold her, basically assuring her that everything is going to be alright which is exhausting. It's always worst at the end of the night too. I've been feeling like Shelly won't let herself enjoy our time together because she is dreading the moment when I tell her that I need her to go because I have to sleep. 

How can I help with my girlfriends anxiety in these matters?  I feel like I'm drifting away from my friends and spending less time pursuing my hobbies in order to help her cope with this stress.

55550,Relationships,2ye3nm,"*Edit: To clarify, we've been together this time around for a year and a few months with no split ups.

So, I've been dating this girl on and off since middle school (we're both seniors now), and our previous break ups were due to stupid arguements, but we always ended up back together. I have some issues with depression, and in December I broke up with her because I needed a break and I didn't want her to have to deal with my issues. 

After about three weeks, I realized that I really never should have broken with her in the first place. My feelings never faded, and honestly it just made my depression worse.

On New Years, I sent her a text wishing her a Happy New Year and such. She said she wanted to talk to me about our situation the next day. So she came over and I explained my reasoning behind why I broke up with her but that I regretted it. I asked if she could forgive me and if we could try again. She agreed.

So the next few weeks pass by, and things seem to be going great. We talked everyday, told each other we love each, etc. But one day she came over and told me how her mom was not okay with us getting back together. She said that her mom thought we should take a break from each other for a few months, and then come back if we still wanted to try again. My girlfriend said she would like to continue our relationship, and she would try to convince her mom to change her mind. 

Days pass, and it seemed like every day she becomes less and less interested in me. She never approached me in the hallway or even said hi to me. She also went to a dance club for teenagers where she danced with another guy (she didn't tell me this, I overheard a conversation about it). I also noticed that she was spending a lot of time around another guy, we'll call him Rango. I would see her and Rango talking in the halls together and flirting. I also didn't attend my school's winter formal due to the breakup, but she told me that her and Rango danced together the entire night. So i confronted her about her and Rango, and she told me that she was distancing herself from me in case her mom made her shut down the relationship completely.

So then her and Rango became a thing. It made my depression worse. The continued on with their relationship, and I completed deleted her from my life. I never said hi to her or even acknowledged her existence because it helped me not think about her. But I never lost feelings for her. 

This went on until about three weeks ago, when she texted me saying that she wants to talk to me. I went and picked her up, and she told me that the entire situation was a mistake. She said that the only reason she talked to Rango was because she needed someone to latch onto so our breakup didn't hurt as much. She said she still loved me and that she wants to try again. She also said her mom was talking about us and how we're evenutally just going to get married anyway.  Of course I said I wanted to get back together, and now that her mom was okay with it, I thought everything would be worked out.

I was wrong though. After a week, she told me her mom wasn't okay with it after all. This really hurt me. She also told me she still hasn't told Rango that it's over because he's having family issues and doesn't want to make him feel even worse. 

So this is where I'm at a loss. I honestly have no idea what to do. I don't know if I should break it off completely or just wait it out and see if her mom comes around. I also feel like the real reason she hasn't ended it with Rango is because she wants to keep him there in case we don't work out.

I met him my first semester of college (a year ago) and we've had at least one class together ever since. 

The first semester, we talked quite a bit to each other, and I picked up the vibe that he had a crush on me. He would stare, talk to me about pointless things, and smile from ear to ear and stare me in the eyes while talking to me. 

The second semester, we didn't talk once and barely saw each other, not to mention the fact we grew apart over break. I personally had a lot going on in my life at the time and didn't want to be outgoing, so I was pretty quiet in general that semester. 

Now, we run into each other a lot around school because we have similar schedules and a class together. We always make eye contact but don't say anything, and in class I've caught him looking once or twice. We recently started talking again, in a group setting, and whenever we talk he doesn't even look me in the eye. I can also tell he's nervous by the way he talks, and he's normally a confident guy. 

I can't tell if he's shy, not sure I'm interested, or just not interested. I also don't know how to make this an actual friendship or something more, or even if I should.

122690,Relationships,29td6x,"My SO is an extremely restless sleeper. Most of what I've observed is in the first few hours of him going to sleep. He's told me that he inherited RLS (Restless Leg Syndrome) from his mother, but I don't think he has actually been diagnosed.

Some nights are better than others, but his more restless nights are somewhat frequent. On a typical restless night he seems to not be able to sleep in one position for even five minutes at a time. When he readjusts himself it's usually in a violent, jerking fashion. He's even unwittingly kneed, elbowed, and slapped me on occasion, in addition to banged the headboard with his arms. He also takes up more than 50% of the bed during some of his positions reducing me to the very edge of my side. He usually doesn't remember doing any of this.

Although I know he does all this unconsciously, being repeatedly woken up from going to sleep often infuriates me (which seems to wake me up even further). Having that blissful sleepy feeling constantly interrupted is torturous, and after a while it often leaves me wide awake and unable to go back to sleep. Since I work late shifts in the evening or afternoon, I've taken to going to sleep several hours later than him, which is only a few hours before he gets up. The relief is heavenly, but being on different sleep schedules has prevented us from being able to spend more time together causing a strain on the relationship.

I abhor the idea of being one of those couples who sleep in different beds. Do any of you have suggestions for sleeping with a partner who is restless/ has RLS?

144294,Breakups,2f9857,"So these last several hours have been very rough for me. Yesterday, I was hanging out with my girlfriend and felt more uncomfortable than I ever have before. Usually, because our relationship has been rocky, I would attribute lack of passion/love to whatever was going on, but I don't think there is a problem anymore - except the relationship itself.

There are a few main reasons I feel that I need to break up. The first is that I just don't feel the relationship is what I want anymore - or so I think. And that's the main problem. I cried last night over the thought of ending it with this girl, and I cried this morning over the same thought. What's the most confusing to me is that, maybe an hour before I cried last night, I was having a lengthy conversation with a close friend about how and why I needed to do the breakup, and I felt no sadness apart from dreading the conversation.

I want to love her. So much. Saying the words, ""I love you."" to her is so easy. It feels right to my tongue. But at the same time, last night I so wanted out. I've wanted out many times. Sometimes I catch myself hoping that she'll do something that I can then use as a convenient jumping point for the breakup.

I care about this girl so much, but I'm not sure I love her. Why am I crying so hard over the thought of losing her if I don't love her? Why does the thought of never seeing her look at me with the immense love that she does just kill me if I don't love her? 

A breakup with this girl would figuratively destroy her. I can visualize her exact reaction - the hysterics, the begging me to be joking, begging me to keep loving her and staying with her. The thought of the breakup makes me want to cry too.

167643,Relationships,39jx7p,"This is a throwaway since my GF introduced me to this subbreddit. I'm also being a little vague with some of our geographic details.

Background:

We've been dating for 2 years. We met in an educational program overseas (we're not from the same country and both live in a third country, let's call it country 3) about 3-4 years ago and were dating other people at that time. 2 years ago I returned for work and we reconnected. After 6 months I relocated permanently to country 3 to pursue a new job and be closer to my GF.

At that time I couldn't move to my GF's city, as my work was about a 4 hour drive away. She lives in a slightly smaller, provincial city and works for the best employer in the area. I need to work in a larger, more metropolitan city due to my career.

We've been commuting back and forth for the past year and a half but she had been unhappy with her work and looking for a job in my city (that has lots of job opportunities).

The Problem:

Several months ago my GF informed me that she'd accepted a new position in her current company and would be staying in her city and not moving in with me for at least a year or perhaps longer. I was a bit shocked but I have been pursuing my career quite strenuously for the past year and I know that she wants professional validation in her current job. 

To be honest, I was so upset when she told me her plans to stay in her city that I considered breaking up with her but eventually rationalized that I should support her in her career as she has supported me in the past year. 

However, since her transition into her new position I've been feeling increasingly frustrated in our relationship. She works very long hours and is often tired and short with me. My gf is generally quite direct, sometimes to the detriment of civility, and I find myself upset with her cutting me off on the phone because she's too busy to talk or too tired.

I also feel that our sex life has been suffering as we see each other on a less regular basis with our respective work schedules. I'm finding myself attracted to other people and am worried that it's a sign that our relationship isn't sustaining me in the way it used to.

My gf is a sweet, funny, attractive, interesting person, and I believe that she cares about me...but I just don't know if this is working. I'm worried that the feelings of frustration, being ignored, and being taken for granted are poisoning my interactions with her and I'm becoming bitter. 

Am I being immature and not supporting her during a stressful transition? Or am I clinging to a relationship that is obviously not working because I'm afraid of moving on?

46937,Breakups,1szldj,"We started dating in 2005 when we were both sophomores in college in the States. The relationship got pretty serious to the point of planning to get married and have kids when we finish our undergrad degrees and return home to Malaysia (both of us are Malaysians).



 We kept the relationship going – there were some very tough times because I was facing depression and was not quite sure what I wanted out of our relationship. We mutually broke up several times but each of us stayed single until we got patched things up again.


But that pattern changed when I started seeing other girls (one of whom was her friend and housemate). I didn’t have any real relationships with the girls and always went back to my sweetheart whenever I broke things off with those girls. And every time, she always takes me back. She also didn’t see other guys when we were not together.


Fast forward to after graduation and we were both back in Malaysia. The pattern was still there: I sought her, she said yes, we connected, and after a few months with her, I break things off again. Because we were never really ‘exclusive’, I saw other girls when we were together, but nothing serious, and she always finds out. But I always return to her, and talk to her, and patch things up.


I have to disclose that throughout the on-and-off relationship with her, I was dealing with depression but never sought help. I was always trying to fix myself on my own.


The cycle of being together and breaking up continued until early last year. We were happier than ever together, until one day I (again) felt choked and wanted out. Only this time, I felt like it would be better if I broke things off with her for good. So I did, but without talking to her and telling her how I felt, which was always the problem.



Since then, I started going out with other girls, with varying degrees of seriousness. And for the first time, I left my college sweetheart with no real contact whatsoever. I still think of her most of the time, but I thought I was being brave and strong by not really going back to her.

It was during this period that my depression really took its toll on me. I was hitting new lows every 3 months or so. I also hit unimaginable highs in between. I kept it all to myself and tried to power through on my own. But when I hit the absolute rock bottom (I was fired from my job, lost a lot of my friends, and almost taking my life), I went to see a psychiatrist.

The first diagnosis was that I had melancholic depression. Soon after getting myself medicated, I felt incredible. I did things that I thought I never would’ve done, including a solo soul-searching trip for two months. At the end of that, I thought I was ‘cured’ and I stopped going to the psychiatrist. I was resolved that my college sweetheart was the one, and I would do anything to win her back and settle down with her like I wanted years ago. I even got my old job back and function like a normal person again.

That high and resolve, however, did not last long. Since I was off the treatment, I fell back into depression several times, but not as bad as before. After several months of the depression cycle, I went back to see my shrink, and the diagnosis this time (after I really truly opened up and be honest with him) was that I have Bipolar II disorder. The symptoms I had showed that I’d had it since my late teens.

Since then I resolved to fix myself sincerely. Be open about my shortcomings, be responsible, stay on the treatment plan, and just be a decent man. I felt sober for the first time in many years, and in this clarity, I realize that my college sweetheart is what I really want in this life. I want to be with her til the day I die.

So recently, I asked to see her and wrote her a letter to explain, apologize, and tell what I really hope for in my future. She agreed to see me and talk after some cajoling on my part. It was not the same as before, and I accepted that. But she heard me out anyway. That was probably the first time I was really and completely honest and sincere with her.

She told me that she was really torn that I treated her like a doormat, and couldn’t shake off the image of me being with the other girls. The trust she had in me is totally gone. Also, her family hates me now that I treated her like shit all these years. 

She’s in a better place now without me, but she hasn’t seen anyone else seriously since 2005. I want to let her be happy, but I also need to be with her. I promised to myself to be an absolutely better man, the man for her. 

She told me to get myself better but don't hold any hopes for her. She also told me not to contact her again as she's in a better place now.

Any thoughts on what I should do? I really want her back in my life and I’ve never been more sure in my life, because I’m finally on a path of real recovery.

TL;DR: Had the girl of my dreams, lost her again and again due to me being a selfish, volatile, and insensitive prick. My behaviour may have been influenced by my Bipolar disorder, but I’m on the path to real recovery. I still love her and want her back in my life for good.

Now, ever since Sunday (breakup), I had work yesterday. It was going great, but I had to sit next to her, and next to her was this guy that she'd brought up when we were still together.

She said that she wouldn't get with the guy cause he's the type of guy that does drugs and drinks, and he belongs to this certain ""social group"" at work that she'd never go out with. The thing is, I've learned not to trust a single word she says, so I took it with a grain of salt.

For the first two hours of work, she did what she would usually do to me - bump into him, smack him with papers lightly, hit him playfully. Surprisingly, it didn't bother me too much, so I just ignored her.

The second half of work comes around, and this is when it gets nasty. She's across the room and he's standing up in front of me, doing some work, and I'm sitting down, doing my own thing. 

She starts looking at him for LONG periods of time to get his attention - I'm talking 20-30 seconds here, and he waves back. The flirting gets more intense, and she gets up and walks over to him to flirt right in front of my face.

While all this was happening, there was this sort of anger inside of me that I'd never felt before. I had the urge to flip her off, say some nasty things, and so forth but I kept my cool and ignored her.

Later that night, I was talking to a good co-worker that knows all of us and I found out that she posted a picture on Twitter of a text with a person. That person texted, ""Do you wanna go out on a date, (ex name here)?"" She replied playfully, but my assumptions are that it's from this guy at work and she's probably going to accept.

The co-worker thinks that she's emotionally immature and that she can't decide what she wants. I personally think a ton of negative things about her now which I won't be describing, but the co-worker and I both agree that their new ""thing"" will crash and burn. It's just a matter of time. 

I don't know why, but this really bothers me, yet breaking up was a good thing for me. I suppose it's because she's rubbing salt in the wound?

I honestly tried to walk away. I told her she needed to find someone whk really loves her, who's not going to treat her like shit. It basically boiled down to her not saying much of anything, and me telling her I wouldn't try to contact her, and I wouldn't respond to her attempts either.

She texted me at first, talking a lot about nothing like how her day went and things like that. I was honestly relieved, since she isn't really a liar and talked about how she was okay. I was so scared she would hurt herself.

I heard from her best friend she had just started seeing a guy, J. I was happy for her. I was left with the impression things were going well. K eventually stopped texting me.

Tonight, I'm home alone. I hear a knock on my door and there's K standing there, crying. I felt like, fuck, if she's here its probably important. She comes inside, asks if she can talk to me.

I make her some hot cocoa (she walked a mile or so to my house in extrenely cold weather) and give her a chance to warm up. She then explains what happened.

To make a long story short, J has been pressuring her for sex since day 1. She tells him she's not ready, and has told him about what happened to her. I guess they argue about it a lot. Fast forward to today. He spends the day with her, buys her flowers and takes her to a really nice dinner. Pays for everything. They go back to his place and start drinking. A lot. At some point, he starts trying to get her in bed. She tells him no. This starts a really bad fight about her not putting out, and it ends with him basically slapping her twoce and  tossing her out on the street. She doesn't have her coat, her purse or her phone. He won't come to the door.

She didn't know what to do, so she came to the closest place she could think of-- here. She breaks down crying and I try to at least comfort her. Shes still pretty drunk, though, and just yells at me about how I let her down. I just let her yell at me for about an hour, I think she just needed to.

After a while, she stops yelling and goes back to crying. She doesn't want to go home, and doesn't know what to do. She doesn't want to be with J anymore. So.... Knowing I shouldn't, I let her stay here. We watch tv on my bed together for a while. She nods off, and sort of is in and out of sleep. 

About an hour ago (I can't sleep, I feel really conflicted and pissed about this) she wakes up and we start talking about us. She's not happy. I tell her to give it time. She asks me if I'm happy. I'm not. She says she's sorry (I don't know for what, I didn't ask) and asks me to cuddle her. I do. She talks about stuff and I'm laughing. Eventually she falls asleep and hasn't woken back up.

And its like, fuck. I missed this. Not in general, with her. And I'll be honest- I still want her. I don't love her, but she's not just a friend to me. I don't know what to do. I can't just push her away again, and I still want to be with her.

Dealing with J comes first. The police are out of the question (K refuses), so I'll probably go with her to get her things.

After that, I don't know. I want her to stay with me, despite the fact I know I'm toxic for her. I /want/ to try though. You have no idea how badly I want to make it work.

Now over the past year she has mentioned a former acquaintance that she used to know from training, lets call him Mark. I never thought anything of it, but then I found out that her and Mark had a history. Now knowing her I know she was probably very much in love with him. None of this would bother me, not her talking about him..we all talk about our exes, in context it makes sense, it is not a taboo thing. 

I always gave the benefit of the doubt and thought she didn't tell me because she was a bit embarrassed. Mark is almost 20 years older than she is, and he is a complete player. I did not want to corner her, or make her feel worse by pushing her to tell me. 

The issue comes in that a couple of months ago, she applied for a job in Mark's company, as in the business that he owns. Now at this point I thought she'd tell me, look there was a history with Mark, but obviously that is done and I just wanted to let you know. And I would have been totally okay with that. But instead she said something like, ""oh Mark is a slimy old man, he is a bit inappropriate with women and he calls me eyecandy, but nothing would ever happen"". Now she did not get the job anyway. And I know she'd never cheat on me.  But I am concerned that she can't seem to tell me about this guy.. who she brings up in conversation every once in a while.. which again I'd be okay with if it wasn't for the lying by omission. 

The crossroads now is that I feel I need to bring this up, before it festers and becomes a big deal, because it is not. I don't need to know what happened, or why she didn't tell. I just want to put it in the open. I am afraid she will lie to my face, and then I am not sure how I'd handle that.

Not sure what to do? How should I bring this up? What do I do if she denies it right to my face? Any help or advice is appreciated.

129897,Relationships,1it2fj,"To make a long story short we're having a pretty rough patch lately. We've been dating for 8 months and we know the ins and outs of each other and the quirks we share as a couple and as individuals. It's been going great these past 8 months and we've made it through numerous rough patches and have grown together both as a couple and as individuals. We're very compatible and we both think we're perfect for each other. All in all it's been a 10/10 relationship.

A little context to what's going on now. She's been struggling with the passing of a family member and has been receiving lots of support from friends and family. She hasn't really been talking to me due to a severe miscommunication which resulted in her closing up on me and us communicating less. She thus has confided in her close friends that are primarily boys. (Which I'm ok with as long as she feels better). I've been trying to be as supportive and as helpful as possible, but we've basically only communicated well twice over the past three days.

Today my girlfriend told me that I actually suck at making her feel better when she's upset, contrary to everything she's previously told me. Whenever she's upset I would always talk to her until she felt better and she would usually end the phone call or text or date with, thanks BigBidet, you always make me feel better.

I just want the best for her but I feel, as of now, that I am insufficient for her. She's been struggling with questions on whether we're compatible (I by all means think we are), and basically has been saying she wants to be with me but is upset that I can't make her feel better when she's upset. (She says: ""her other friend can make her feel better when she's upset so why can't you?"" In her words: ""It's the things he says and the way he says it that makes me feel better"") 

My mentality is that if a couple can't make each other feel better, then they are incompatible and thus there is no need to date.

**I guess my questions are:**

1. do you guys think it would be better for her if we broke up?
2. Is my mentality completely wrong?
3. Why would my girlfriend be lying to me about such a significant part of the relationship and does this mean she's lying about other things too?

52250,Relationships,2zz9os,"As I am now. Husband of 2, two month old and 6 year old step daughter.
Story I met my wife many years ago, she moved and got married, we talked a few times after that but she was in a different state. Her and her husband moved back up here and we got back in touch. I was much different than what she had so she fell for me and I was in a failing relationship anyways so we ended up getting together. Dating for a few years now, just over 4 and married less than 1 (July) we have a house, I am in the same job but make a decent amount, I'm in college again, two month old boy, our 6 year old, and marriage problems.

 Around April 21 2014 at 6 pm, I found out that things were not going good, I got on her fb and found flirty message with her and another man. Now she's cheated on me about 4 times and I still love her but I'm getting numb to the feeling of betrayal. I really am hoping things work out to the best but they are like best buddies again like they were before any of this happen, even years before me and her. I do my best to let her do her thing with him and hang out and smoke.

 I think I'm just boring her, I'm a career guy, don't drink much, I don't smoke drugs. I have enjoyed the safe road, and I think that's the problem. I could smoke and drink party but now days I want to stay at home and do nothing. I been clean of druges for 5-6 years I don't want to start that but I don't want to be boring for her. I feel as thought when I try to do something with her it always goes wrong, now I just want to do nothing, just work and let her do what she wants in hopes that she will stay with me because of that. I haven't been sleeping well recently, I feel as he is beginning more than what they should be again. But I also feel like there is no stopping it anymore, I don't feel that upset about it, but it keeps me up and thinking....

Tldr:
Cheated on me for months now about 4 times physical. Still together me and her but won't stop talking with him. I don't and won't leave her yet.","Me [27 m] with my wife [25 f] 1 year, cheating and staying together",0.0,False,4.0,10.0,1427084428.0,/r/relationships/comments/2zz9os/me_27_m_with_my_wife_25_f_1_year_cheating_and/,Romantic
9756,Dating,1nf9pc,"So here is the deal. I have had what most would call a rough childhood (read: inconsistent housing, instances of sexual abuse, early drug use and sexual activity). At age 16 I was working as a prostitute for many of the local casino's upper management (this is in the middle of nowhere on an Indian Reservation, although I am not Native myself), and by 18 I was mostly stripping in the nearest populated area and occasionally sleeping with men for money. Over the years I developed a nasty drug habit (mostly pills, heroin when I could find it). HOWEVER, there is a happy ending. At age 19 I met Karen (obviously not her real name). She is literally the best thing to ever happen to me and essentially helped me get into an apartment, start classes at the local JC, and get clean. It took me about a year to begin to feel...I don't know how to put this....like a person? By age 20/21 I had a job, a car, I went to school, and I had friends. It was surreal, and it still is to be honest. 

SO, here is where my current issue comes into play. About 6 months ago, my lease on my crappy apartment was coming to an end and Karen told me she knew a boy (let's call him Mikey) who needed a roommate and lived in a great house by himself (and with da kitten :p). She said boy, even though he is 33, and she is right in many ways. Mikey lacks many social skills, and it can be very difficult to have a conversation with him if you don't know each other. I have never brought this up to him, because I figure if he has a diagnosis and wants to tell me, he will, but I strongly suspect he lies somewhere on the very high-functioning end of the Autistic spectrum. He has speech delays and difficulties, often seems uninterested (even though he is), and will never, ever start a conversation. Besides his very obvious social issues...I think I'm in love with him. He literally makes me feel weak in my knees, my heart flutters,.....the whole deal. I feel that I've seen him go from reclusive to actively talking to me. We have the most genuine conversations, and in a lot of weird ways, I feel that we connect in an unspoken sense as well. I have never felt this way for another person before; the last boyfriend I had was pretty much my dealer, and I purposely did not date while I was attempting to begin a normal life. 

So, the problem: I am in no position to jeopardize my living situation. I have almost nothing in savings for a security deposit, the rent is cheap, and I love our current way of being. Secondly, I know for a fact that he is a virgin who has never had a girlfriend (he actually told me this a few weeks ago, I tried to be as understanding and supportive as I could be without acting like it was something shameful), but he has almost no knowledge of my past. He knows that my family is dead/not in my life, I grew up in several small towns/reservations, and that I used to be a stripper. No knowledge of the sexual abuse, prostitution, drugs, my living situations, etc. 

As of now, I have no idea what to do. If I tell him that I have feelings for him, I'm not sure how he'll react or what he'll say/do. I don't want to ruin things with us, because I know we are the closest thing each other has to family...SHIT can I please have some wonderful advice I feel like I have nobody to turn to....I want to pursue things with him, but I don't even really know how a functional relationship works...

TLDR: Have strong feelings for my older, socially lacking, virgin roommate who is basically my best friend....Not sure how he would react to my more-than troubled past, or see a future for us.

This guy seems really nice, messages me all the time (but gives me my space when it's due) and I can't help but keep getting paranoid that things are going the same way as they have in the past. I'm fully aware that I may be being a bit paranoid and expecting a bit too much too soon but helps to talk about it. 

So we started talking and things he said I didn't believe due to conflicting posts on Facebook - so I asked him, got an answer and was happy with it. But now I keep questioning other things even though it is probably completely innocent. 

He still goes online and that makes me question whether the things he is saying to me about hoping it leads somewhere, are just keeping me sweet. 

Thing is, he's asked to see me again, so we are going out again but I just get this niggly feeling that I'm there until something better comes along. I'm not sure whether this is due to my own insecurities from the past or whether it's that my intuition is right. This is even after being a bit crazy and just saying to him that if he's not that interested it's absolutely fine and we can just leave it as it is. To this he responded saying he really liked me and didn't feel that way at all but understood why I may have felt that way.

We've known each other for about a month and a half, and we've been hanging out as a group for the last three weeks every Saturday. A few people bailed on these days but the people who were always there was her and I. Over these few weeks a few of her mates have joined us to hang out and I get along with all of them alright . I've also loosened up with her, since I was very shy when I was originally in her presence. 


This girl seems like she is one of a kind; she's funny, flirty, cute, helpful and incredibly caring/maternal to her friends. She is selfless and independent, helping all those around her. Since she cares so much about others, I feel really drawn to actually looking after her for once. I find these qualities pretty rare in girls my age, it makes her stand out to me immensely.


At this point she knows I like her, she just asked me if I was interested in somebody right now and I told heheyeah, her. She kinda liked me too however we never spoke about it again. She was also asking me what type of girls I'm In to when discussing my female best mate, who she thought I linked initially.


She always looks at me when we're out, even when she's not directly speaking to me.. We make long eye contact where we smile and make faces at each other. When I said I had a sore back, she asked me if I wanted a massage. I said no because I thought it would be a bit weird, not that I didn't want it. She also always hugs me super tight, plays with my hair and says how cute I am. I do not know what she meant by this, if it was in a friendly or flirty way. Before I left she told me to text her when I got home so she knew I was safe.


Later on we were texting each other and she was saying how fit my hair is and that she wanted to keep me. I said wouldn't yh is other girl be jealous and she said that I loved her more. She then commented on how nice I was to her and how she thought I was kind, cute and funny. I said a similar thing in response and then went to bed.

Her best friend, who we'll call Bon Qui-Qui, is almost always there when we're hanging out.

I fear that if she were to say no, she would completely cut contact with me and I'd lose her friendship (these girls always talk about people who they rejected as if they were some sort of enemy and not their friend anymore).

So a few days ago I signed up on OkCupid, free online dating service. I didn't expect much from it. I signed up as it was recommended to me by a few redditers. I could meet girls online so I could practice my communitaion skills with them without the anxiety I have IRL.

I was told to not be so emotionally attached and just have fun with it. So I did for a couple days; messaging girls I thought were attractive, never really expecting a response. It was great until I saw this one specific girl who lived a couple states away from me. She is a 96% match and a solid 9 so I immediately skimmed her profile and sent a message. I turned off the computer and left it at that.

Tonight I opened up the app again and saw that she had read my message, but no response so I did the usual and started comparing our personality questions' answers for the hell of it. She seemed to be the perfect match for me. Almost all of her answers complimented mine. This was no surprise since we had a 96% match so I went back to her profile and started reading it in depth.

She has almost everything I want in a girl. She literally is the closest IRL personification of my ""perfect girlfriend"". She was into everything I was into; anything from video games to tv shows to food. On top of all that she is a solid 9, no a 10.

Then I realized my horrible mistake... The message. It was the most poorly executed piece of garbage of a message I have ever done. I can't take it back now. I might possibly just ruined my chance at the girl of my dreams because I didn't think she'd even consider reading my message.

While we were there, I would say I got along with her the most out of all of my friends there. We were of the same mind on a lot of topics and it was generally easy to hold a meaningful conversation. At the time, though, I was dating someone else, so Katy and I never developed any romantic interest.


Fast forward to now. Both her and I have left said university, and I have been keeping in contact with her more than any of my other friends because of the interests we share. She also lost a family member to cancer, and so we talked a lot about that and I was there to listen and stuff. Also, I have been single for over a year at this point.


I don't know exactly when it happened, but she started dropping hints about some guy she liked and confusing thoughts she had about that situation. I usually like talking about these things, because it gives me an idea as to how other people think about romantic matters. It is very interesting. Anyways, right off the bat I assumed it was me, but pushed the thought out of my mind because how in the world could I know that. Looks like I *was* right though, because she was dropping pretty specific hints.


Here's my dilemma:


1. I would be lying if I said I hadn't considered the possibility of us being together, but I just don't see it happening. The specific emotional connection that I've felt in the past just isn't there. And after my last girlfriend, the idea of being in a relationship makes me sick.


2. Katy still is my good friend. I don't want to hurt her feelings in any way and I do value the friendship. She is very sensitive, and I am not so much. I feel like I would either be too straight forward or beat around the bush too much if it comes to letting her down.


3. We live about 600 miles apart. If I were looking to be in a relationship, I wouldn't want it to be a long distance one.

All under the be-witty-over-text pressure that is always there for me, off course. 

Anyhow, this IDGAF-what-you-think attitude caused me to be me. We talked some more and I even let genuinely nice me have a go sometimes. Yesterday we really hung out (I had seen him before/talked to him) IRL for the first time. And I noticed I could be myself with him. Well, as much as possible for me. I felt really happy watching Pokémon together, with his arm around me. Yes. HIS ARM AROUND ME.(as far as people and affection go this is a big deal for me, never had a relationship blah blah) I liked his arm around me, sitting close to him. I liked his awesome hug where he just lifted me of the floor. It was like flying, man. But the idea of anything more than those “cuddly” things immediately provokes a “NOPE”. I am just not that physically/sexually attracted to him. 

My ideal situation would be “friends with cuddle benefits” (???) I guess. Would that be weird? Am I leading him on by letting him put his arm around me? (when he asked if it was okay I said yes). Should I tell him I don’t see a real relationship happening with the whole kissing and having sex thing in it? (Though I must say he never spoke out loud that he likes me so I don’t know for sure whether that is his goal.)

----------------------------

**TL:DR;** I, an relationship-wise inexperienced person, watched Pokémon with a guy I like as a person, I let him put his arm around me and I liked it. I am however not interested in a (sexual) relationship. Should I tell him this straight up? Would I be leading him on if I didn't? Is friends with cuddle benefits a legit thing?

I would love to hear some other perspectives on this situation since I, like mentioned earlier, don’t have a lot of experience in this area.","Me [19F] with my friend [19 M] I met at the start of this university year, not sure how I should feel about/deal with our relationship.

My boss was initially hired on at the same time I was and so we cultivated a friendship for the last three years. Before he became my boss, I gladly invited him to my wedding, because I considered us to be friends. Unfortunately, he has been really, really aggressive to myself and my other coworkers, to the point where he has made people cry. This is someone that I am learning is not a friend of mine, nor of many people. He has a bit of an anger problem and a drinking problem and I do not want him at my wedding.


The problem is that he is my direct supervisor and I am so intimidated by him, that the idea of telling him face-to-face to not come freaks me out. I was thinking maybe I could e-mail him saying that it feels uncomfortable to have my boss at a personal function, but I would still have to deal with the repercussions of uninviting him via e-mail when I see him at work. I am at a point where I will be leaving the company within the next six months to a year, and am seriously considering just quitting after uninviting him. This is the potential e-mail draft I have so far:

&gt; Hey boss,
&gt; Let me first say that this is absolutely nothing personal. I've been thinking a lot about what you've said about work vs. personal life and friendships in the workplace. While nothing has changed between us, I do feel that I would be uncomfortable having my boss at my wedding, due to how I and some of the guests are your direct employees. I don't want this to affect our working relationship and I don't imagine it will, but I hope you understand.

Basically, I want to pause my schooling and go to work at a small company with my friend. 

I'm currently attending a local community college. I consider myself a smart cookie. I know i'm well-read and I pick things up fast. But I've never been good at school. I'm not a good student. In the past, I do think it was just laziness, but lately, things have been overwhelming and anxiety-inducing. It's mainly school but it does carry over into other things. 

I wasn't always like this, I don't think. For the past year or so it's been hard for me to finish things. I get anxious even starting. Essays, for example are a big one. Even if my essay sounds good, I've done all the work except for the conclusion, the thought of finishing it and turning it in makes me sick to my stomach. I can't explain why. I feel like i just can't do it. I feel sick, my heart palpitates, if it gets really bad, I almost shut down. Eventually everything began to feel like that- essays, reading printouts, opening my book, attending class. 

Because of this, I really really want to take a break. At least for a year, but definitely for a semester. But the problem is my mom.

I defintely have some issues with my mom. She's weird. I wouldn't call her narcissistic, but probably a bit controlling. When i got my first job, she was mad that I had put in applications, wanting me to focus on school. When i started getting my own paychecks and opened my own checking account (previously my debit card was under her main account), she was upset. When I bought my own phone and data plan, she was upset. When I go out late, she gets upset. 

When I picked out my spring semester schedule, I was feeling a bit wrung out, and wanted to ease back a little on my G.Es. I picked two classes of subjects i'm interested in, one general ed class that I needed, and a class related to my major. She didn't like it. I ended up taking four GEs and a total of 14 units.
That only wore me out even more. I told her I was tired, I wanted to take a break. What I really wanted to do was take a semester off but we compromised on one non-general ed class. But it didn't help-especially when several times a week she would ask how my class was going, only to listen to a sentence before going, Ok but next semster you're going back to normal right? Finish your GEs because *you have. to. transfer. already*. The next semester, I did go back to normal. But that's when my mental started getting especially bad. Halfway through, unbeknownst to her, I pretty much gave up entirely. 

My friend works at a small company, and the other day I interviewed, and they hired me on the spot. I basically see this as my exit ticket. If I work, I can't go to school, I can save up money and move out and get away from her. But I know it will be hard, I don't have any kind of degree, not even an AA. I don't think I want to give up on school entirely, but when I told her that i interviewed, she freaked. I couldn't tell her that I actually got the job. She told me that I **can't** take the job, she's disappointed in me, that by even interviewing, I was basically telling her that I'm dropping out. What was I thinking? I don't even have an AA. I need to focus on school. I'm getting too old, no university is going to take me as a transfer student after 25, that's the cut off date (I don't think this is true, but I don't actually know and one of her friends works in education). I don't have the drive or dedication to work and go to school. I'm never going to go back, she's so upset, I'm distracting her at work.

Honestly, i feel like shit LOL! 

I don't know if i have the drive to do both. Its so fucked up- somewhere in me, I do think that I can do it, be a student, get any kind of fucking degree just not right now. But maybe I can't, maybe i'm just a fucking bum! Lazy ass cant fuckin pick a task and stick to it, can't follow through on anything, can't HHHRHRHGH


I know that i'm an adult. Technically she can't stop me. But she can make things harder for me. Charge me rent, take me off insurance, kick me out...I don't know if she would disown me, but the guilt definitely could eat at me every day! I want to be financially independent, I want to move out. But she doesn't want me to. And its so fucked up, I feel like because I live at home, offer nothing to the household (I clean up after myself and pay for the things that I want/need out of my own pocket but i don't pay for rent or water or electric or anything), they've paid for school, i *have* to do what she wants. The guilt kills me. My friends don't understand what it feels like. No one understands.

Maybe she's right and by stopping school i'm seriously fucking up my prospects. Regardless of anything, I did take the job. But I don't know how to tell her without....i don't know...having her not hate me. And I can't tell her how much school is making me feel like shit, I can't bring myself to show her that weakness. Will she even believe me? I know I have to but..

I don't know What I Want Out of Life. This year especially, sometimes I feel like I don't always know who I am.

47785,Dating,2hwkv1,"So a little over a month ago, I started seeing a guy which began with drunken sex. That was our first actual encounter together. I knew him previously, but we only recently hung out and got to know each other that week. I had gone to his area to visit a friend on my vacation, and that's where we hung out. I know this sounds bad to start with. We then had two more encounters, sober, during that week.


After I went home, I wasn't expecting much but we ended up speaking every night, whether on the phone or online through video chat.


This is continuing now, and I have since gone to visit him twice already (for the weekends). When we are together, it feels as if I am dating him, but I don't know if we are.


When I ask him, he always has a joking reply, such as yes, you're my girlfriend. But, then I ask him again, and he says, I don't know, I never really thought about it much. I just don't like that fact that we are far apart and there could easily be other girls he is talking to, or am I being too paranoid for thinking that? We talk every night, for a long time. 


When we are together, we do things that couples would do, and act like a couple would act. 

I'm not sure what to do. I don't want to be used.

1072,Relationships,3220jl,"Every day I am looking out for the next piece of manipulation, the next play for attention, the next thing that will add some poison into my life, everything to bring her attention, approval and everything to make me feel like I'm constantly serving her emotionally for very little reward.

We live together with my daughter (6f) from a previous relationship and our baby daughter (11 months).  

She's totally self-centred.  I can't really sum up how totally self-centred she is.

For example, if I tell her about something cool our baby has done, she will instantly take credit and seek approval....Yes, she did that because I have been teaching her to do that.  Even if she didn't do it she will lie and say she has.  It's almost like if someone gets approval for something she can't sit there and enjoy their accomplishment, it has to become her own.

It's actually so deeply entrenched in her.  For example, she was tidying with my daughter and I went in and gave my daughter a big load of praise for doing such a good job.  My gf without any empathy clarified that it was mostly her that did the tidying, almost implying that my daughter was being dishonest in accepting any praise.  I was left sadenned that a potentially fabulous moment that could have encouraged my daughter to embrace the need for tidyness suddenly became about my gf and her amazing tidying skills.

If I say something like wow, our baby just did something I've not seen before....my gf will say yeah, she did that with me last week......ahh ok...

She consumes all our conversation time with self-gratifying verbal diarrhea.  If I talk about something she will quickly change the subject or relate it back to herself.  I'm finding more and more that our conversations are so predictable.  I'll say something, she'll turn it back to her and talk for ages, vacuously.  I know that most is exageration, fabrication, just stuff to make herself look amazing.

She's a walking talking self-obsessed manipulator.

She wasn't always like this.  She has her good days, she has her bad.  Last night she went pretty crazy.  Drunk quite a lot and was talking endlessly.  I was just listening to nonsense hoping she would stop.

I've looked at what I think she could have.  She seems to possess a lot of the traits of someone with NPD.  She lacks empathy really, because she is so self-serving.

We went to an aquarium for my daughter's 5th birthday.  A heart melting moment was when my daughter noticed a charity display talking about how many sharks were killed each year.  She burst into tears because she didn't want the sharks to die.  I went to her to support her.  On her own birthday she was forgetting the fun she was having and instead thinking about the poor sharks.  I had a lump in my throat and I said we would give some money to help the sharks and they would be saved....my gf stood absolutely stone dead 5 ft away.  She couldn't have been more unmoved.  She didn't even say a word of support.

I was really sad that she didn't feel any kind of empathy for my daughter.  A young child so at the mercy of very confusing emotions, and I imagined my gf thinking more about the inconvenience to her, how she was looking at us with a deliberately impatient face to make us feel guilty for stopping and again serving her emotionally.

It does make me so angry.  If she just lost all this bullshit we could be so happy.

How can I approach this with her?  She is so hyper-defensive about anything.  Can never admit weakness or fault.  If I've ever criticised her in the past she will get defensive, not say she's done anything wrong, cry, make me feel guilty for upsetting her, then the next day she will be on her best behaviour to get in my good books for a while.  It's so contrived.

About a year ago these comments escalated, and I confronted her about it after a period of childish behaviour on my part. I started giving up on our relationship and we weren't intimate, I didn't speak to her and everything was fine. After a couple of months of this we started talking and we decided that we where at a crossroad in our relationship and went to a couples therapist and she found out after two sessions what we basically already knew, she doesn't want kids and I want and recommended that we part ways because I would most likely blame her for giving up my dream of having my own family.

He was never married and has had no kids.  So it has always just been himself to take care of.  

He was well off with a 2011 370z sprots car and four walls of very expensive wine in his cellar.  I mean afterall he was a wine sales man for most of his life.  When he decided to retire he got a nice retirment fund from Wines&amp;Spirits the company he worked for.

My uncles was so particular about things that as kids we used to think it was so funny to mess up Uncle Jims hair that he always moosed and slicked back.  So particular that my mom used to say he had OCD. Now that was never diagnosed or determined by anyone with a degree in that field.

However on Thanksgiving of last year my family went to my Uncles house for the celebration.  I couldn't go so I called my mom to chat with her.  When she got on the phone she just went off about how cuttered my uncles house had gotten.  How there is so much stuff he just buys it and leavs it in the bags just sitting around the house.

Well his neightbors a few months later had noticed he wasn't acting like himself.  He wasn't paying his bills and couldn't recall things that had to do with time.  So they gave my mom a call, my dad was working in the area where my great uncle lives so he stopped by.  He knew something was going on but he couldn't put his finger on it.  So that weekend my dad and mom pick him up with some belongings and just asked him to come out and visit which he was fine with.

My Great Uncle has had a stroke in the past so my mom wanted him to stay a while at our house to see if she could pick up on anything elsse.  She couldn't just take him in to the docors because he doesn't like going.  Well a couple of weeks had passed.  He was at a baseball game of one of my little brothers and he fell down and had a seizure.

So paramedics arived and took him to the nearest ER where they kept him over night and ran some test, blood work the usual stuff they do.  When the doctor asked my uncle his age he told him he was 35.  When the doctor asked what year it was his response was nothing close to 2014.

The doctors told my mom that he is suffereing form Alzheimers but from years of consuming alcohol that the term is Alcohol induced Alzheimers.  The doctors perscribed some medications and at first we could see some slight changes.  He looked at his fingernails which were long and made a gasping noise and asked my mom for some finger nail cutters.  He had been at my Mothers for a while and I had come over to visit and I had asked how he was doing and he said he loves my brothers dearly but it is time for him to go home.  When my mom told him that the doctor said he can't drive he said he would find another that said he could.

So my mom has to get all his affairs in order like paying his bills, seeing how much money he has to fingure out where he can afford to live by us.  Also what to do with his house etc.  

She has made trips to his house for the last 2 months to box up all of his stuff to put it in a storage unit.  So she can rent it out and use that incoming money to fund wherever she decides to put him in a home some where close by.  She is just giving his stuff away to friends and family and whatever is left she is planning on having a garage sale.  She gave his Nissan 370z to my brother (24m).

1. Emma's biological father is a dick.  

2. Emma has four older sisters. All were raised at least partially by her bio dad. Emma's bio mom left bio dad when Emma was a newborn because bio dad was physically abusive. Good for bio mom! Her sisters, however, remember him and refuse to acknowledge his faults.

3. Bio mom remarried when Emma was two. She was raised by step dad who is an amazing person.

4. Bio dad supports all of Emma's sisters financially in some way. He makes car payments and pays cellphone bills for the oldest two and put all four of them through college.  He still give the younger two monthly allowances and is paying for one to go to grad school. He does not support Emma financially in any way and insists it is because she doesn't love him enough.

5. Bio dad has been diagnosed with terminal cancer. He's got 3-6 months.


Bio dad is a lunatic.  He will call Emma and leave these long rambling voicemails accusing her of using him as a piggy bank (although she has never asked for money from him). He will harrass her sisters and tell them that he is desperate to talk to Emma but that she hates him and is punishing him.  Whenever she tries to call him back he ignores her phone calls for months at a time and will text her telling her it is too painful to talk to her.  I think he legitimately believes he is the victim in this situation because he is completely unstable.  He gives big, expensive gifts to her sisters and even though Emmais putting herself through medical school (!!) will make a big show about how she doesn't deserve his support because she's manipulative and lies a lot. Seriously, I hate him so so much but it is really difficult for Emma to see that her bio dad is this huge asshole.  Everytime she reaches out to him he shoots her down and then will come back begging for forgiveness. She's always happy and then a few weeks later he will write her a long email about how he knows how much she hates him and tells her he needs time to heal and she's left upset and confused.  Also, everytime he throws one of these sporadic tantrums he calls all of her sisters and they come after her too. (The sisters thing is weird because besides him they're all close. He has this way of manipulating them).

When she told him he exploded and told her to stop being so selfish and that he couldn't change the date of the wedding just for her (WHICH SHE NEVER ASKED HIM TO DO). He wants her to drop out of training (which she can't do) to be with him while he dies.  I told her that even if she gets cleared to go I doubt he would recognize or appreciate the sacrifice.  In my opinion he has not changed and will not change.  He won't all of a sudden be a good person because he's dying.  



She is really suffering though and maybe I'm too close to her to recognize I'm being unreasonable. Is it cruel of me to tell her to stop talking to her father?  Should I encourage her to be with him while he dies? She comes to me often for guidance because we are close and I have no idea what to tell her.

24383,Relationships,2cx5a8,"My wife is a kind person so I'll make that clear up front. We've had problems before which may affect my perception of things. But my problem now is she's always had this man, married to her friend, who tries to get with her. She's never done anything wrong with him to be clear though he has tried. 

But he talks to her a lot at her job where his wife also works. He also says things about her that are highly sexual to others. He tries to get her alone. So I think there are grounds for me being nervous about him. But I don't think anything has happened between them.

On top of that is the problem that despite being something like 48, the guy lives like he's an actor in a Mtn Dew commercial. Everything is extreme this and extreme that, he jumps off things and does crazy shit left and right. He has people film it on their phones like he's one of those kids who skates all day, then he and his friends get together and compare videos of them doing stupid things.

He talks about all of it extremely loudly and intensely. He talks about everything intensely. Even at dinner if he wants the salt passed to him, it's like he's shouting that he needs salt and shitting himself at the same time, while his face turns purple.

He'll go for days without sleeping so he can ride his bmx or mtn bike as much as possible. He hurts himself a lot. But he also intimidates me trying to get me to go along with this stuff, which is definitely not me.

So I've always dealt with my nervousness about him by joking with her that he is her boyfriend.  When she comes home from their house and I know she saw him, I ask how he is, when are they going out next? etc. and we laugh about it. It's worked so far to defuse a situation I don't like.

So, the idiot went and jumped some bike or something off some cliff and ended up needing surgery because rocks were under his knee cap or something. I admit my wife was telling me this like it was a life or death story, she was concerned and had tears in her eyes, and I was nodding gravely while thinking about what a moron he is. He got that junk out of his leg and he is fine, it was nothing hugely serious amazingly. He has his wife and his friends, even his boys to help out. 

What is getting me down is that my wife is either over there helping out this past 2 weeks every day until fairly late, or else is at home talking about him and his injury and how intensely extreme it all is. And I'm jealous and feeling threatened. 

I feel petty too but I don't want him and her around each other so much, especially since his drug cocktail he's on now is basically removing his inhibitions according to her and he's saying worse things than usual. I don't think anything is going on, I think he's out of it and not really even able to walk, but I worry this is the beginning of some new thing.

So what can I expect here? Do I just let her keep being his nurse and bringing him things or do I have a complaint? We're childless so it's just me being a child here, but do I have a valid concern?

169670,Breakups,1n2y95,"Hi reddit, 

This is my first real post so please excuse the grammar and the wall of text, also I'm very bad at writing. 
 
Here's the story, I've been with my boyfriend for about eight months and he's a great person, my best friend and I can honestly say I've never felt this connected to another person or this much in love before. 
So here's the downer, about a month or so ago I recently found out my boyfriend was, in my eyes chasing someone, he would tell her things like ""your boobs look great"" or ""I would really like someone to cuddle"" all at the beginning of our relationship and continued contact until the month I found out and to me it hurt a lot seeing that I trusted him completely from the start and that that kind of behavior is unacceptable to me considering my past (being cheated on in all my relationships) and that it's a common precursor to cheating, also it just hurt a lot... Like a lot more then when I've been physically and emotionally cheated on in the past. 

Anyway when I found out brought it up with him and he was VERY sorry, he ceased all contact with her and proceeded to try and prove to me that I should give him another chance, before I go on I must stress that it was only flirting that took place and i do believe nothing else happened but the reason that it hurt me so much is because of my already low self esteem (that he knew about) and I guess I just felt betrayed, that he would, even if it was only talk, seek comfort in someone else when I was always there for him or compliment someone sexually in a private setting and just generally consistently flirting with them while saying the same things to me. 
I know what this seems like but he is a good person, to this day he's still sorry and occasionally I cry about it and he holds me and apologizes over and over again never getting mad that I bring it up, he's doing everything he can to make up for it and I believe that people can change for the better. 

My question is reddit, how do I move on, or more so how can I deal with it without feeling like I'm emotionally punishing him? My anger over the situation mixed with fear that it'll happen again and sadness that it did hurts him as much as it hurts me and I don't want him to hurt, he's genuinely sorry about hurting me and is very patient and willing to help me trust him again.

39553,Breakups,33z0h4,"I broke up with my long term boyfriend Mark* at the beginning of the year. 

Neither of us were pushed about marriage and we are both childfree by choice, so you can take it, that it was a life partner situation. We'd been living together for 5 years. We were happy, financially secure, pursued our passions (well I did, he suffers with depression) travelled etc and we just had a really comfortable life together. 

Apart from the relationship breakup, my life for the last 12 months has been an avalanche of shit. Death, financial insecurity, redundancy, severe family issues. I am basically in a big fat hole, with real physical problems and I am just slugging out each day as it comes.

I loved my ex, body and soul, but in recent years I was living with a shadow of him (depression) and I don't believe he loves me in that way any more, so there is nothing for it. Also, the fact that he could leave me when I am at rock bottom is like a curtain has been pulled back. He is truly not emotionally equipped to deal with some of the stuff in my life. He's still my best friend. 

And you know, that's fine. I need someone who can support me when shit flies, like I supported them. I think I was always the stronger person in our relationship, and I probably need someone to be stronger. 

I haven't bawled my eyes out over it (much), because I was already ripped to my core over other stuff, I couldn't physically feel any worse and I'm not the sort to wallow. I find myself grateful for the really small but important things I still have left.

I'm not in denial, I want to move on, I had a brief period of excitement about it in fact. But I do have like dissociative trauma, a coping mechanism I think I've used all my life, where I am blocking out all the emotional bullshit and being ruthlessly pragmatic.

Such that, I have absolutely no interest in pursuing life as a single person. I was always independent in my relationship so nothing has changed, apart from, my bank balance (nothing to do with the split, both financially independent people)
I have been out and socialising since our split and my heart is just not in it. I can't afford it either (working on that).

Its boring to me, I am not connecting even with my good friends on a real basic level because I refuse to talk endlessly about the pile of shit at my front door. Its all very complicated stuff and I truly don't know who even cares. I am not going to meet someone IRL either because of my persuasions. 

My best friends, haven't even asked me about my ex, in weeks, I assume because they think I'm 'ok now' ??!!  But sure, do people really give a damn? I found out, not, back at the death of my close friend. Something I was always prepared to talk about, which is still very raw, no one has even mentioned, in months. 

Mark has moved away but he visits the odd weekend, since I have 'custody' of our pets, and he is helping me with some stuff. He has pulled up an emotional wall since our split, but he's still my friend and even though he's pretty useless, at least he 'gets it' and he knows where I am coming from without a big back-story. Yeah, he is a real comfort in my life. I kinda hate that he's the only one right now. 

I know *who* I am and what I want, and just because I'm at ground zero now doesn't mean I can't move on right? Sometimes I feel like damaged goods. 
The emotional baggage will fade. I can date, right? : /

I find myself on dating websites thinking, what am I doing, who would get involved with this. I'm not going to drop a weight at someone's feet, I don't with my friends. But I'm still the same person, right? I can start building new relationships.
I don't really care of what nature, I never have. 

Do you have to be your 110% you, to pursue a new relationship?

Before I met Mark I was a really happy, motivated, self confident, single person not looking for a relationship. That is the absolute truth. But I was also 22. 30yr old people have shit to deal with, baggage, right? I can skip the finding myself all over again part?

To go back to being a happy single person would be some attempt at a grand pretence.

24316,Relationships,29pnxj,"Recently ran into a friend and she told me she had been at a party with some of my boyfriend's friends. She recognized one, but wasn't sure if that's how she knew him so she mentioned me. They said Oh yeah, [BF] never hangs out with us because of her. That's all they could say about me. She was kind of taken aback because I have always made a point to not let my relationship affect MY friendships and she knew I wasn't the type to keep my boyfriend from his friends.

I don't think he has actively blamed me for bailing on them, but still has kind of made me the bad guy in this situation. He's a pretty introverted person and would rather stay in than go out partying. Before we were dating, if he didn't really want to hang out with them, he'd make some excuse (tired, homework, etc.) and stay home. Now, when he doesn't want to go out, he'll want to cuddle and watch a movie with me so he'll tell them, Sorry, I'm hanging out with my girlfriend. I don't think he'd ever made it seem as though I'm MAKING him not go out with his friends or anything, but after hearing no enough, I wouldn't blame them for not being a fan of mine. 

I should also note, these weren't his CLOSEST friends. He hasn't dropped his social life for me - he still hangs out with his close friends.  

It just bothers me that his actions made his friends dislike me without even knowing me. I don't need to be friends with his friends, but it'd be nice for them to at least have a positive opinion of our relationship. What makes me mad about it is that I always pushed him to spend time with friends when I noticed he hadn't in a while. I was doing exactly the opposite of what they think I was doing! At this point, though, we've graduated so there's no way to fix this. He probably won't see these friends again. Do I need to do something to make this not happen with his other friends (I'm not sure if his other friends share the sentiment)?

Me and my boyfriend have a whole host of issues in our short past, but when things are good they are very good. We recently got back together so I'm going to try and avoid citing his past mistakes as they aren't entirely relevant here.


Anyways, I had a few days off from work so I decided to stay at his house the past few days. He currently works 6am to 12pm so I've been alone in his room during those hours. Yesterday night  I ordered us a pizza, and afterwards the pizza guy texted me (dominos takes down your number prior to delivery) saying it was an accident. But then he continued to text apologizing, asking if the pizza was good, offering me free food. I replied twice with Jake (my boyfriend) looking over my shoulder, politely declining the food, as it all seemed a little out of the ordinary and I didn't want to make Jake uncomfortable. He jokingly suggested that the pizza guy was interested in me, but I could tell he wasn't entirely joking and that it concerned him. I made light of it and the night went on. The next morning I woke up feeling very sick (me and Jake both have colds) and slept almost the entire afternoon while Jake was at work. He mentioned the pizza guy again when he got home, ""jokingly"" asking if I'd been texting him all day.

 Later on when I felt a little better, Jake and I went to the gym and came back. We started undressing to shower and Jake was doing all the stuff I liked, trying to turn me on or something. I reminded him we had to hurry and shower, because his roommate wanted us to have dinner with him. In the light of the bathroom, Jake suddenly looks very upset. He stands in front of me and bends to look between my legs. He'd just been kissing me and my body so I was turned on, and my thighs were a little wet. 
""Cum?"" Jake asks, his voice getting angry. ""I know it's not mine""
I got immediately very hurt and reminded him of what he'd just been doing to me in the other room. I even touched the fluid and held it up to the light, saying semen was cloudy and thick, and this was thin and clear. He mumbled dismissing words and showered without me. 

Later after we'd both showered, I held him and asked if he really thought that I'd been with someone else, and he coldly replied that he doesn't know what I do when he's at work.

I'm absolutely floored right now. Between the two of us, Jake has the least reasons to be suspicious of infidelity because of the past. what am I supposed to  do? This isn't the first time he's suggested that I've been with someone else, but it stings the most. 

Currently he's laying with his back to me, and I don't feel like I should have to apologize or try and make nice but this'll be the last night I see him until Sunday.

Last night, I was trying to initiate sex which is always difficult to accomplish on my end.  On my third attempt, my boyfriend goes looking for something. After some searching, he comes back and says he found what he was looking for: a sex toy. A few days earlier, he had brought up introducing sex toys to the bedroom and I was on board and enthusiastic. Of course, I kind of assumed we would be buying one. We were even joking about how gross it would be if tried to save money by searching through the bargain bin for a used one. 

When he mentioned using the toy he was already in possession of, I was immediately turned off. I asked if it was used and he responded with a Well, yeah. of course. You just boil it to clean it. I became super uncomfortable and sort of pissed. I told him that I was absolutely not interested in putting something in me that he had put in other girls. I didn't know how to interpret my reaction or deal with my emotions and kind of shut down for the night. I distracted myself with reddit, but since I was actively trying to not think about the situation it kept popping up in mind and was met with waves of revulsion and anger.

I really just want to get a handle on my feelings. I'm not sure why I have such a strong visceral reaction to this and I'm not sure why it pisses me off that he would offer to use such an intimate object that was used in a (or several, I'm not sure) past relationship. I'm not sure if he thought the fact that he knew the women it was used on made it less gross than if it were used on a stranger, but those women are strangers to me and their connection with my boyfriend makes it so much worse.

So...why am I feeling this way? I know he wasn't being malicious, but he was probably being an idiot. How do I get over feeling so angry and grossed out?

tl;dr: Boyfriend wanted to use sex toys he had used in previous relationships. Why am I so angry and repulsed by his suggestion? How do I get over those feelings?

Edit: I'm gathering that, for me, it's more about the history of the toy than anything. There's a, not necessarily rational but instinctual, repulsion of using a pre-used toy, as well. I'd have to agree with those that say this is mostly stemming from my own insecurities. I'll even reluctantly agree that I'm being childish to an extent. Lucky for me, I have an awesome boyfriend that loves and respects me. I think I can approach him about how I feel and why I reacted the way I did, and (thanks to everyone's input!) make sure he understands he's not in the wrong. I don't think it's something I'll be comfortable with, but he's not a  bad person or anything for approaching me with it. And we'll absolutely make a shopping trip in the near future.

Also, come on guys, I know that his penis has been in other girls! I was even trepidatious about using that line because I figured people would go there with it. I included it just because that's pretty much went down and what I said. He seemed to gather what I meant, so picking apart the semantics of it is a bit silly.

She was widowed about 10 years ago and has since refused to date. She moved 3 hours away to be with extended family but doesn't seem to be happy at all.

I try to call once a week; she has told me in the past that during the week is never good for her. We've spoken once a week for the last few months.

When I spoke to her two weekends ago she revealed she was very depressed and upset. I didn't know what to do. I gave her many suggestions -- join a group, has the doctor fixed her medications, move somewhere else, find a new job -- but nothing seemed to help. It was just long silences on her end if I didn't talk. I told her she could call me any time she wanted to talk and that I had a trip planned the next weekend but I'd call her the next weekend. She said okay.

This morning I wake up to a message from her about how it was like the phone call where she was upset never happened. That it had been almost two weeks since we'd talked and that she was busy this weekend so we wouldn't get to talk this weekend either. She accused me of being too wrapped up in my own life and that all my focus went to my husband, my friends, and my job.

I'm really sorry but this is getting so tiresome. It's been like this since my dad died and I felt like I had to take care of her rather than grieve my own loss. She works at a job she hates and purposely takes on too much then gets upset that she can't do all the work (she admits this herself). She refuses to date so she's lonely. She doesn't go out after work so she's bored. She moved away so she misses me and her friends. How can I fix any of this?

I feel like I'm not allowed to have my own life, I'm supposed to be worrying about her all the time. Even if I try to adhere to her schedule one thing throws it off and I get a huge guilt trip. I want to ask her if this was how she communicated with her own mother but I know that would be a huge blowout fight.

The last time we fought was Mother's Day because I planned a trip to see her but it wasn't long enough and that she was sure I'd be spending more time with my father in law on Father's Day. Nope, I definitely wasn't staying overnight with my FIL, and when I got there she didn't want to go do anything. No games, no movies, no shopping -- and that's what it's like most times we go to see her.

I feel helpless. Does anyone have any idea what I can do? I understand that she's lonely and upset but I don't know what I'm supposed to do about it. On top of that, I feel like a call to her is a homework assignment -- I HAVE to do it once a week rather than calling her because I have good news or something to say.

90219,Relationships,2qdwko,"Well my girlfriend and and I have been together for over two years. It all started when I used to play the game Maplestory, where through their I coincidentally met her. Now this wasn't those really 'i met her online' type of relation as she actually goes to the same college as me and I knew her in real life. But we really only started talking because of Maplestory. It was all great as we chatted daily on Skype and fb and this eventually led to me asking her out and we started dating. Note: This daily talking went on for about 3-4months before the start of our relationship.

Now, the relationship was great initially, she was my first girlfriend and I was her first vice versa. We started off cuddling, which led to kissing and eventually fooling around but never having sex, as we felt we weren't ready for that yet. Which was fine by me. 

We also went on dates once in a but as we had school and during weekends we lived pretty distant from each other which meant these dates were not often but they were great. But because of that we Skyped called often.

Now, everything was great up to this point. Good times together, attracted to each other. What more could I have asked for? But eventually she started getting slightly forceful in the way we do things together. An example of this is me having to read to her every night as she 'could not sleep without hearing my voixe'. Which to me was fine as I didn't really mind and if it made her happy sure why not? 

But as it went on she wanted more, she wanted us to talk more and I obliged and thus my studies also went down, I wasn't surprised that it happened as I did spend a lot of time, but I was doing fairly well for school so I wasn't too worried. 

Now at this point is when I feel it started getting out of control, she started getting angry whenever I didn't make her happy and she started ignoring me because of that. Because a long time ago I had promised saying, I'll listen to whatever you say as long it's in my capabilities to make you happy. She has been saying that since. I stood with what I said and thus our relationship still managed to stay alive.

But as time went on and on she started ignoring or giving one word replies whenever she was even slightly unhappy at me. Furthermore whenever she says ttyl,  her next message is either hours later or never happens unless I say something. I has started feeling she wasn't interested in our relationship anymore and yesterday night on Christmas eve I was saying to her do you want to countdown to Christmas and she said no as she was too tired and eventually stopped replying as I thought she fell asleep. So I was about to sleep but just check my Facebook one last time and go bed, but only to find she was still active? Hm how weird! So I was a bit curious and logged on to her Facebook, only to find that she saw my messages on Facebook but was replying to another person instead and never replied back. I know she saw it but it just seems she was too into the chat with another guy. Now now, in no way am I saying she's cheating, as their chat was fairly short.
But since then I have only talked to her once and all she said was she fell asleep. But I just have the feelingthat's not true and  our relationship is on the road to a breakup or maybe she just lost interest.

So just a quick update on the Vern situation for those of you who have read about it. He hasn't been sending either of us messages lately, but he has resorted to childish guerilla warfare. When Marie and I were out in the backyard trimming bushes/pulling weeds, he locked the back door on us so we'd have to walk around to the front to get back in the house. He packed up everything in the kitchen that was his (fine, whatever) but I'm sure it was for the specific purpose of making sure we didn't touch his shit. Today, he came home from work and is playing the radio so loud we can hear it clearly downstairs and outside.

He still refuses to talk to either of us. The one thing I'm afraid of is that right now he's just doing petty shit just to piss us off, but I'm concerned he might escalate his actions. Do we have any legal recourse to take before he does?

TL;DR: Vern is acting very childish. Locking doors, playing radio/tv very loud. Do we have any legal recourse before he escalates things?

166943,Breakups,2lidp4,"We dated on and off 4 years, 3 straight, prior to that we were FWB/neighbors in college. We got to a point about a year and a half ago when we almost broke up as graduation we nearing and we didn't know if we wanted to move forward/in together. We moved in together. We had a great first few months and a decent 1 1/2 years of living together. I took a trip with friends for 2 weeks and when I left everything was somewhat fine. We both had insecurities, but other than that minor arguments/issues. Well, I got back and she wasn't as intimate with me, and kind of disconnected. I asked her what was up and she basically told me she had been gradually losing interest in me and she didn't know what to do. She brought up continuing and hopefully things would work out, but still the feeling of after 1-2 weeks of a disconnected partner was awful. I felt myself becoming more insecure and decided to bring up moving out. Logically, I knew it was time. We had grown apart. I still loved her but it was time. I moved out, we cried, and still texted up until about a week ago. I knew at this point no contact was the only way to go. I blocked her number, deleted her on snapchat, unfollowed her on instagram. Yesterday I reactivated my facebook and she messaged me letting me know a letter from my brother had come in the mail. I only responded with my new address. She then responded with a message saying she was missing things. After that I messaged her thanking her for all the great memories and experience but let her know I needed to cut contact and say goodbye and asked her to respect my need to go that route. She responded by saying she wished we didn't have to go this route, and she would miss me, and it was difficult for her as well and she hoped we could be friends one day and said her goodbyes. I didn't message back and deactivated my facebook and blocked her from following me on instagram ( I had already stopped following her but my curiosity kept checking her little portrait as it was the only thing I could really see of her). It's been a hell . I can't stop thinking if she is moving on quicker than I am, or what caused us to grow apart. I miss her terribly. She was my best friend for all those years, I have 2 great roommates who have been keeping me busy, but its still tough going to bed without her. I cry myself to sleep and force myself to go to work. I put on a mask at work, but this tear is gradually eating me alive. I've read many helpful posts, but this pain is nearly unbearable and unlike anything I've felt before. What if she starts dating?

So I met this guy on a dating site.  We took it slowly at first, 1 to 2  dates a week.  We didn't even hold hands until about 3 dates, and we first kissed on maybe the 5th date.  However, things started really picking up and we slept together on the 6th date and started spending all weekend together.  He lives about 1.5 hours away so we don't see each other all week but spend the entire weekend together.  It's been about a month and a half now since our first date. 


He is very affectionate toward me, calls me to talk occasionally, and likes to go out and do things together, such as hiking, skiing, movies, dinner.  He also seems to get my sense of humor as he laughs at my jokes and says I'm funny.  I feel very strongly about him - he's very driven, soft-spoken, well mannered, and attractive.  

Here's the catch- he's an army officer and has the choice to leave or stay at the end of this year.  If he stays he will be deployed in the summer.  He says he is most likely going to stay.  This was in the back of my mind from the beginning but I decided that would be a bridge I cross when it comes up, because if he meant a lot to me then a deployment is something I could handle. 


About a week ago I was feeling like things were going great, and I wanted to know what we were, aka, the talk.  But it was kind of brought up casually, he said something about me having to tell my parents about him…I said that's a big deal though, my parents will ask so many questions. to which he responded, well you've told your parents about other boyfriends before.  I said, does this make you my boyfriend?  He seemed surprised that I asked that and said, I don't think we need to put a label on it, or take it that fast.  Him saying that made me visibly upset.  I reacted emotionally and said, what are we then? are you dating other people? He said of course not.  But he brought up the fact that he was leaving because of the army and after deployment would probably be in an other state and therefore a long-term relationship would be difficult.  

After he saw that I was upset, he told me how much he cared about me and that he was sorry [he's] really bad at this kind of stuff.  And then he said, it's fine, you can be my girlfriend.  I said no, obviously you're not comfortable with that yet. 


I don't know if he's saying this because he's afraid I wouldn't be willing to stay with him, or if he just doesn't feel strongly enough for me to make me his girlfriend.  Since then things have been fine..he got me a small xmas present and said he had missed me over the week.  I'm going to give it more time and see how things pan out.  

Please, I'd love to hear some thoughts…preferably from guys or other women who have been in a similar situation.  Thank you so much for reading this!

76603,Relationships,3dcic7,"Might as well warn everyone now this is going to be one fucking long post. Honestly i'm new to this subreddit so i'm hoping this post is appropriate. If it's not, I apologize. I'll start from the beginning with my first relationship. Let's call him...Duffy(M/17). Now Duffy and I had been in an emotionally and physically abusive relationship. It all began when he lied and cheated on me. I didn't know how to handle it so I became someone I never thought I'd be. I watched him like a hawk and held a grudge until I finally settled back down and forgave and forgot. Surprise, surprise. A couple months later he did it again. This time I went ballistic and we got in a tumble. Long story short I ended up with a broken arm. He ended up feeding me some sob story about his dad abusing him and I was young and naive so I let him manipulate me back into the relationship. We continue with me accusing him and him holding me down, pushing me and screaming in my face during regular arguments. A year later we began making plans to live together. This made my parents very upset (due to religious reasons)...so we did what every responsible couple does... we get engaged...I knew it was so wrong...But my parents loved him and I was seeking their approval so I went along with it. Not only that but I knew he was suicidal any time i tried to leave him. Fast forward, I get into an accident he takes care of me while I heal so I don't have much time to process anything before the wedding. We get married... He manages to steal 20,000 from my parents and he runs off to a different city leaving my parents with no choice other than bankruptcy. I am absolutely lost. After spending 4 years with this person, who I allowed to make all my decisions and basically turn me into a different person, I don't even know who I am. 

Three months later meet...Jacob(m/21). Jacob quickly becomes even more poisons then Duffy. We started of in a flame and I was head over heels. He begins telling me that he suffered from PTSD (He was a former solider) at night so he likes to have someone to sleep next to when he wakes up from nightmares. Me being me, I totally believe him and start spending the night at his place. No hankey pankey goes on because I didn't feel ready and I had only ever had one partner. Jacob of course pretends to be fine with this. One night while lying in bed, he starts to come onto me. I push him off as usual telling him I'm still not ready. He doesn't stop. I say stop. He still doesn't stop. I end up laying there silently crying as he does his thing. I blame myself and try to forget. At this point I was basically living at his house against the protest of my parents. A month later his ex is supposed to swing by his place to pick up some things, I try to trust him and go about my day. I receive a phone call from him telling me that he had sex with her but half way through he stopped, and said  I can't do this, you're not Mylifeisapottytrain I, although I felt hurt and angry, ignored it because i thought it was sweet. Sheesh...Anyways fast forward a couple weeks. I am now terrified to wake him because I know if I do he will force himself upon me as usual, and I will have to go upstairs and wipe off the blood and suck it up. I made the mistake of accidentally nudging him only to have him grab me by the throat despite my struggle to get free..He held his grip for about 30 seconds before letting go...we never spoke about it. From then on out he beat me down verbally until I couldn't speak or look him in the eye when he was upset with me. He constantly told me I dressed like a nun and I wasn't fun enough. I finally smacked myself in the face, pulled up my big girl panties and left...On my birthday. 

That was probably the hardest thing to have to go through...I had been battered at that point and I was at the lowest point in my life. My friends had chosen my ex husband over me and I didn't feel like I had anyone left. Along came my current SO, we will call him Hunter(M/21). Hunter is tall, and sweet and kind...I have never been treated so well. He has a daughter but I decide it's not an issue. 4 months into the relationship I find out he's still in love with his ex and I was met with the harsh familiar reality of his last words before I left the apartment You should have known better. At this point I plan on not going back. I wanted to change and find someone who appreciated me for once..He comes crawling back after trying to rekindle the flame with his ex only to change his mind. I foolishly fall for his crocodile tears and take him back. 

It's been 7 months since then and he has been good to me. Treated me well, been open with me and always tried to look out for me. I have established an incredibly strong bond with his daughter, him and his family and he now wants to get an apartment together. I will have to give up my horse among other things to be able to afford it but it's the only way he will be able to stay where I am and not have to go back to living with his father. He is also saying that he's building his future around me.. I want to help him, but I'm torn. My mother is also now telling me she will not support me in any way, deny me my inheritance from my grandfather, and sell my horse if I move in with him. I want to support this man I am in a dedicated relationship with, but am I just pushing the self destruct button like I always manage to do? Or is it really worth it..Is my mother being ridiculous? Or am I being immature? I seem to doubt everything now a days and I'm at my wits end...I just want to settle down with someone I can trust but I don't know who to follow or believe in anymore...

TL;DR 
I have been abused and lied to in every relationship i've had. My current SO was in love with his ex 7 months ago but we have done great ever since.

I've been good friends with my best friend and roommate, ""Betty"" (F 38) for almost four years. We've been through a lot in our friendship, including me supporting Betty through a self-destruction spell she went through after her her ex, ""Ellen"", dumped her and treated her badly, in my opinion. One of the stands I took to try to stem the tide of self destruction resulted in ""Ellen"" nursing years long anger towards me, and they actually cut contact for a year after that incident (which is SUCH a long story. Just, it was bad, and I understand why ""Ellen"" wouldn't want me around after that, but I felt I had no choice. Everything I did, I did to protect ""Betty"".). ""Ellen"" contacted ""Betty"" after that year and they 're-kindled a relationship that, from the outside, seems healthier than their previous pattern. I felt very hurt by this briefly, but worked through it, resulting in me extending genuine forgiveness to ""Ellen"". I don't know if ""Ellen"" still hates me with the fire of 1000 suns because we have a traumatic enough history that I've never felt the need to speak to her. I don't know how worth it that would be, and forgiveness doesn't always mean being best friends anyway. It just means letting go of the resentment. I did this for the friendship with ""Betty"", as I refuse to allow resentment about ""Ellen"" to ruin a good friendship. The anger was useless and would only hurt me in the end anyway. I have done my best in the years since then not to express anger about ""Ellen"" beyond neutrally stating when asked why I took the actions I did. I will never think ""Ellen"" was a good person at that time or behaved honorably towards ""Betty"", but if ""Betty"" has forgiven then I have no right to micromanage that. It has been very hard to be the ""bad guy"" who has to stay away when ""Ellen"" visits from out of state, but I've never been a person who feels the need to stay included for the sake of being included. I have friendships ""Betty"" isn't apart of too, it's ok. 

Recently, my husband and I have been going through a heart ripping, horrendous challenge. We have lost our youngest child and I'm grieving. Two friends who were present when the event happened that brought my world down, a couple, ""Cindy"" and ""Alan"" (F22, M20) came to stay with us briefly to both help them out of an uncomfortable situation and help me cope in the weeks after. Things were ok first, with me feeling greatly supported through this nightmare. As time went on, I began feeling a great deal of pressure to ""be positive"" and ""keep up the fight"" when my heart is broken. It's only been three months since this happened, and I'm just not done grieving. We've gotten nothing but bad news about this situation, and its very challenging for me to grieve and also nurse the PTSD-like symptoms I've been experiencing after this trauma. I saw them together and bonding while I feel persecuted for being so sad and in their words ""making this (our house) an uncomfortable place to be."", although they also acknowledged that it's not exactly my fault. Then, I found out about a beach trip that they had planned for months without me knowing, because they didn't know how to tell me all the spots filled up. I dealt with it, decided to look at that weekend as a chance for my husband and I to bond and strengthen our relationship, but I won't pretend that it wasn't hard to read eight different Facebook statuses about how they all bonded, and they were ""all a family now"" as a result of that amazing trip. It hit me like a ton of bricks after my family had just fallen apart. At the same time, we had a trip-up of communication regarding who was going to be responsible for bills while they stayed with us, and ""Cindy"" responded by talking to ""Betty"" and they agreed separately that ""Cindy"" and ""Allen"" would pay no bills because they had bought food here and there. Fine, but it would have been nice to be part of that conversation instead of just being told that's how it was. I felt powerless and angry, and I responded by retreating to my room for weeks and not talking to anyone. I don't know how to deal with this all at once and wasn't in an emotional place where I felt like I could put myself into a conversation where I might feel invalidated without an emotional meltdown on my part, so I simply didn't talk to anyone. In retrospect, I see that that behavior was unreasonable. If they didn't know what was hurting me, they couldn't very well help, could they?

All the hurt and resentment culminated in a huge argument between myself and ""Betty"" that ran through the whole house. Even my husband and myself argued, as I felt betrayed that ""Betty"" had been allowed to storm in and yell at me about a general, but pretty bitter Facebook status I had posted, while he sat there. He was even told by ""Alan"" that he appreciated hubby being ""neutral"" when I feel attacked from all sides and just needed someone to be unambiguously on ""my side"". Maybe that's immature, but I'm struggling. ""Betty"", my husband, and I sat down with another mutual friend ""Vanessa"" as a mediator, and had a long talk. ""Betty"" feels I've become overly negative and have allowed losing my child to take over everything while not helping myself by going to counseling. There are legal issues, and anything I say to a counselor could be discoverable, and I'm really struggling with finding the ability to be safe and talk freely knowing that. But ""Betty"" doesn't feel that she can listen to me for ""months"" while I work out my feelings when she feels I'm not doing anything to help myself. She knows she should have said something about the beach trip, but didn't know how to tell me, but also doesn't want to have to feel guilty about having a good time. I don't want anyone to feel guilty either, but it hurt. It just did. I can't help that. She said the reason she and ""Cindy"" and ""Alan"" hang out so much is because they're making the efforts haven't been making lately. I understood. We agreed to keep talking and continue working things out, and I've been hiding less, and she even went out with me and hubby to pick up dinner this evening. 

Which brings me to the event that is the purpose of this post. We got to talking about this weekend. I've had what I thought were standing plans to go to ""Cindy"" and ""Alan""s new place to watch GoT, which is a huge devotion of mine. I've been counting down to the premiere for weeks, and since ""Cindy"" has gotten cable and our tv broke in the middle of all this bullshit, she told me I was welcome to make a standing date to watch it there with them, and they all acted like they were looking forward to sharing this thing that makes me happy at a time where there is precious little happiness for me. We started talking about how ""Cindy"" had checked with Hubby again to make sure I was coming, and ""Betty"" balked. Apparently, ""Ellen"" is coming into town this weekend, and ""Betty"" had already arranged for her to go there to meet ""Cindy"" and ""Alan"", and there are plans to do dinner and for them to watch it together. I was hurt, but decided that I would make an effort to be graceful, and state that ""Ellen"" and I can cordially co-exist while taking in the show. ""Betty"" responded that it ""wouldn't be a good idea"", and she's right. I can't believe I even suggested it, given our history, but damnit, I guess that's just how desperate I am for a special plan for me and my friends to work out. So I just casually (again, trying to be graceful and not put the impetus on ""Betty"" to rearrange her day) said that I would message a friend who's also into GoT, and who I've been wanting to get to know better anyway, and see if I could catch it with her. But her cable won't be hooked up in time, and she's also thinking of seeing if she can go to ""Cindy"" and ""Alan's"" or to her parents. 

So I'm the odd one out, again. And while ""Cindy"" and ""Alan"" and ""Ellen"" and ""Betty"" all watch it together Sunday, I'll be sitting here with my husband and a broken tv. I don't know if they understand how much this meant to me and how much happiness RR Martin's work has made me in a time where I have precious little to make me happy. They had to have known how pumped I've been about it, as I've been counting down to the ""Purple Wedding"" for weeks now. But I don't know how communication went so south that I went by the wayside again. Should I have been more explicit? ""Cindy"" and ""Alan"" do know I have issues with ""Ellen"", although I've never been explicit about what exactly happened because I've put it behind me. I promised myself that the next time something hurtful happened that may lead to me withdrawing again that I would talk with them, but I don't know how to do that. With losing my son and legal issues, I feel very vulnerable right now and I just have no one to talk to right now who isn't also close with the three of them. I'm not sure what to say or how to say it, but I know I have to say something when the alternative is me doing a fade and just saying ""fuck having friends"". I'm so tired of being hurt and pushed aside while not feeling empowered to stand up for me and my needs without coming across as a controlling bitch who wants the.world to revolve around whether she can watch a show at someone's else's house. Right now, part of me wants to cruelly ice them out and resigning myself to just seeing it when it.comes out on DVD and just resuming my wait for the sixth book. My heart is broken without my child and I just needed people to unconditionally be there for me and behave as though they wanted me around. I'm just so hurt right now, and alone. It's hard for my husband to understand and his response is to change my feelings about this or find new friends. Why, if I was going to have to live with this horror and trauma, could I just not have unconditional support to help me carry on? I'm sitting here sobbing because it all just feels to unfair, like the world is just a cold, horrible, indifferent place and I'm all alone in it. I'm not asking them to take my undiluted anger or negativity for days on end or put up with me lashing out or include me in everything so I always feel like I'm their Sun and Stars or The Moon of Their Life. I'm just asking them to want to do something fun and happy with me sometimes, and not always be the one who doesn't fit. Or is my husband right, and I just need to give up and try to make a new support system? Right now I'm not sure if I'm in an emotional state to try when I'm eccentric enough that making new friends is a dicey thing for me to begin with?

TL;DR: I'm recovering from massive trauma and grieving one of my children, and my friends seem very uncomfortable dealing with how I feel, as well as just generally being an exclusive club I can't get into. After recovering from some massive communication hiccups lately, including me deciding to put aside some resentment on my part, I now find out they have invited someone I can't be around to something I thought everyone had agreed I was coming to.

31751,Dating,1zh4cf,"I am a 16 year old guy living in the north of Britain. I an at sixth form college and am somewhere between a geek and an emo, more on the geek side I would say. Also really socially awkward with most girls, worried I might say the wrong sort of thing. Bullied earlier in life, couldn’t even talk to girls throughout high school. I now seem to become just friends with them.

So I started my first year of college back in September, the usual new school thing, but this time everyone else was like that. I also knew some people from my previous high that went. So on the second day of term I sit down in my Media class next to this girl, we shall call her Bel. 

Me and Bel started the awkward first lesson talk, which then escalated into a conversation I might have with some of my other female friends. We talked about the TV shows we watched to the books we read, to places that we had been. We then, over the next half of term, start talking a lot more in class and a bit outside of class (Facebook and that). I then decided that I liked her.

I then on Halloween got a girlfriend who I loved and adored. I didn’t keep it secret; everyone knew that I had a girlfriend. But I was still friends with this girl, I thought that she was good looking and a good friend, but I had no thoughts of wanting to cheat on my girlfriend. But she almost got flirtier with me and started talk to me more, and at any point in class, finding any excuse to lightly punch me or grab my arm. At the time, I thought it was inappropriate, as I was in a happy relationship and I didn’t want to give the wrong signals. So I would casually mention that, “My girlfriend watches that show” or “My girlfriend to me the same thing”.

Skip to January when I break up with my girlfriend, (teen relationships, I can hear the hate, save it) only two months I know, but still very sad none the less. I then start liking this other girl [16 F], Not Bel. But then I find out that this other girl likes another guy, so I go back to liking Bel. 

(I know it sounds like I just skip from liking one girl to another in a heartbeat, but I talking about a week of thinking and trying not to cry over life)

I now an sat in the lessons with her talking, flirtatiously, about things like sex and looks and people that we like (she has never mentioned anyone who we know, just celebs and such), and comfortably about things like TV show, movies, books etc. On Facebook however, I have been talking joking around saying a lot of funny/dirty/offensive thing to her in jest. I asked her about them and she said it was fine, then making them back.

I was thinking about going to take her to see the new 300 film this weekend, or at least inviting her, she is normally fairly busy on weekends (I have that confirmed from other good friends of mine, not just stalling tactics) Please help.

At 5'7 115lbs, I am a slender woman. I haven't always been. when I was 18 I peaked at a whopping 247lbs and I worked very hard to get to where I am now. But in the process of losing all that weight, I also lost my breasts. Now, I'm not even an A cup. All bras are baggy/loose except for sports bras. It bothers me, and Ive considered implants but spending thousands of dollars on something so vain while I'm also putting myself through school seemed irresponsible and frivolous. 



Often we will hang out together and browse Reddit, its always good for a laugh or two before bed. A few nights ago we were doing this when a picture of a model with large breasts came up. My boyfriend said ""Hey, it'd be alright if you had boobs like that."" I laughed, thinking he was just kidding, and asked what we would do if I actually had boobs. His face lit up and he got excited, saying ""Oh, I would definitely touch you more and buy you sexy lingerie like every day and you'd probably have to beat me off with a stick!""


I was taken aback at this, because I had thought that he loved my body.  I asked ""Do you have a problem with the way my boobs are now?""


""Well the first few times I saw you you were wearing a bra and I thought they were smaller than average but you're cute and it didn't bother me much. Then we went on a date and you leaned over and I saw down your shirt and that's when I realized that you didn't have ANY boobs and I was like 'ICK' but it's no big deal, babe.""


I don't think he realized how much those words hurt me. My brain more or less shut down at that point and I went to bed. I normally end up going to bed alone, we fall asleep together maybe one night a week because he always stays up until 2am playing video games. We don't have sex very often (3-5x a month) and Ive tried to work with him on spicing up our bedroom but he doesn't seem interested. He never initiates sex, ever. Now I'm thinking that its because he doesn't find me attractive. I wouldn't want to sleep with someone whom I found ""icky,"" but I also wouldn't be in a relationship with them. 


Now I feel ashamed to take my clothes off around him. Ive been wearing baggy shirts to hide how boyish I am. I feel so self conscious now and I don't know what to do. I went from one end of the weight spectrum to the other and I'm still stuck with body issues.

159944,Non-Romantic,2pc8w7,"A bit of background:
I have known this friend, who I'll call Laura, for two or three years. We were best friends (my mom keeps mentioning her as a ""lifelong friend"") up until a year ago, when I moved school. My older sister, who I'll call Katie, still goes to the same school as Laura, while I have moved elsewhere.

So at the beginning of this year, I moved to a new school, not too far away. I try to keep in good contact with Laura, but seeing her once every three weeks doesn't seem like enough. No worries, we still keep close except for the odd conversation where I'll feel a little more distant from her than I used to. Its probably important to mention that while I may see Laura 1-2 times a month, Katie sees Laura most schooldays.

Recently I had Laura over for a Christmas party, and I noticed something was a bit off. Katie was with Laura and I most of the time which was fine, but Laura was laughing at Katie's jokes and tending to gravitate towards her more than me. I felt like the third wheel, which I have never experienced, and it was awful. No matter how hard I tried to make conversation, or joke, or anything else, it felt like Katie trumped me with her wittiness. There were a few inside jokes from school that I did not get that Katie and Laura mentioned, which left me feeling out of the loop. A similar situation happened a few months ago while watching a movie, but I didn't think much of it until now.

I don't know where to go from here, so right now I am avoiding contact with Laura as much as possible. It doesn't feel right that my own sister is also friends with Laura, and might even be closer to her now. I neer know how to act, but at the same time its not my place to tell Katie who she can and can't be friends with. Its too awkward to talk about this with Laura, and I don't want to jeopardise this relationship even more. Any advice would be welcome, I'm meeting up with Laura at the movies next week.

36455,Relationships,383bs9,"I'm not completely sure what's going on here and would really appreciate an outside opinion. Just to preface this: my boyfriend is typically a very wonderful partner and an amazing person.

This started happening a while ago on our anniversary. I surprised him with a trip to a city we are looking at moving to. I made the surprise into a pretty romantic moment and tried to paint a picture of how the gesture was meant to be one of the first steps in planning our life in a new city together.

My boyfriend got us tickets for a dinner event for our anniversary. It was an event that he wanted to go to and he just kind of mentioned we were going. I didn't realize it had anything to do with our anniversary as we go to dinner events pretty often so I expressed how I found this a little odd. He told me Do you really think that's what I got you for our anniversary? and explained there was much more. Well, there wasn't. No card. No flowers. Nothing. He didn't really acknowledge our anniversary at all.

For my birthday he made a big deal giving me a trip to see my best friend in another city. He offered to pay for my flight whenever I wanted to go see him. Finally I took him up on my present but it took him a few weeks to even start looking at flights for me. Since he's booking them on points the flights are fairly restricted and the only flights left required a 6-9 hour overnight layover. It is a 2 hour flight, I have MS, and am willing to sleep in the airport one way but can't do both ways. I expressed this to him and he said he would keep checking.

Finally I became frustrated and just booked my own flights. My boyfriend puts things off until they become a real problem and I wasn't going to risk missing my best friend's call to the Bar date. He had told me previously if I could find flights under $450 he would just pay me. My flights were $442 and he has yet to say anything.

My boyfriend had previously announced he would be taking me on vacation for a holiday and another time to Disneyland for a holiday but neither of which have come to fruition. I've tried to have a conversation about this with him but he just shuts it down with Well that was only if I was there for work ... but that wasn't initially what he said at all.

I'm really disappointed in my boyfriend's behaviour because he makes big promises, rarely comes through, and just ignores the situation as it passes. It hurts my feelings immensely because I really would be just as happy with flowers but he seems to be all or nothing. 

I think cashflow might be an issue but he also makes over 5x my salary so if cashflow is an issue, there might be a complicated underlying issue.

I don't want to seem ungrateful for the kind things he's done for me in the past but I do expect him to follow through on his word. Am I being a spoiled brat? How can I help us resolve this issue?

Yesterday, I went on a date with an acquaintance that I was recently set up with through a friend (we'll call him N). We went to a soccer game, and we had a really fun time. He's kind of dorky, which I am also, so we were for sure having a great time By general standards, he's pretty good looking, although I didn't really feel any romantic/physical attraction. 


After the soccer game, N invited me to go over to his friend's house to grill steaks and have a few beers. His friend (A) turned out to be a little less goofy, but equally as friendly and smart, and I noticed that we sort of...""clicked"". We seemed to have a lot in common, and I felt a lot more attracted to him than my date, despite him not being as conventionally handsome (though he was still attractive). A's parents ended up coming by for a bit to drop some stuff off, and we got along amaaaazingly (more than I have with most parents I meet). I was really surprised about how much I liked his approach to life and how genuine he seemed while remaining kind. N had been talking to me earlier about his friends, and he stated several times that they were assholes (not a good sign).  


After we ate dinner, we ended up going over to N's apartment complex to go hot-tubbing with some more of his friends. Everyone was really friendly and inclusive, but I just noticed that A and I seemed to agree on a lot of things and interact a little more comfortably than N and me. To boot, I caught him looking at me several times throughout the night. Later, we were joking about how tired we were and how we're ""super old people"", and he sort of said to himself while doing the dishes ""Seems like we have a lot in common, my friend"". After a bit, I gave N a hug and left. When I got home, I noticed that A had added me on facebook, which I wasn't expecting. 


I am pretty sure N wants to go on another date with me, even though I am not really feeling romantic towards him at all. I like him as a person, but I just didn't feel the instant attraction that I had for A. I am 100% against causing drama and turmoil among friends, but I also am not down to ignore my feelings, because that will for sure lead to dishonesty one way or another. What's the best way to go about this?

31663,Relationships,38cz54,"I'll try to keep this as short as possible, but there's a lot of history for context.   I guess I'm just looking for some kind of idea from the hive-mind of reddit if I'm being unreasonable for feeling the way I feel, or if I'm really the selfish, lazy jerk here.  

Been together since college, married for four years.  We've both had to grow up and figure out how to communicate like the adults we are now, not the kids we were when we met.  So some of our earlier fights were clearly the result of poor communication skills.  

In the beginning, we dated on and off but didn't have sex.  He finally told me he was in to bondage.  I had no idea what that really was, I was  thinking blindfolds and maybe tying my hands together.  The internet as a resource was still kind of a new thing, so I didn't do much research to find out what it was.  

After a few fights about it, we finally established that he wanted me to do my own research to figure out what parts/kinds of bondage I thought I might be in to so we experiment together.  From my perspective, I kind of thought that he should take the lead, because A) he wants to be dominant in the bedroom, and that to me meant he would be leading the action and B) this is his kink; I'm willing to try stuff he wants to try but he's the one with the ideas at this point.  From his point of view, he wants to try stuff first that I'm comfortable with, and the only way I would know what that stuff is would be if I would do some research about it and suggest ideas of things I want to try. 

We went around and around like this.  Hell, we still go around and around like this.  But I did try a bit.  I joined an online forum for beginner bondage.  I bought a couple of books of erotic short stories that focused on male domination and bondage, to see if any of the situations in the stories tripped my triggers.  I asked him to show me some of his favorite porn.  I wasn't really comfortable looking at porn on my own, but I enjoyed watching it with him. 

We talked about safe words and hard boundaries.  We tried stuff.  Some of it was fun!  I liked it.  Some of it was...not so much fun for me, but I got off seeing how turned on he was by it.  Things were good for a bit.  

But there were issues.  The big one is that he has problems getting it up.  He would get hard during the warm up, but as soon as we tried to have actual PIV sex, he'd go soft.  He'd get frustrated and upset, then I would feel like shit, too.  Weed helped a lot, which made us both think it was more anxiety than a physical problem.  I also think that he had been looking at bondage porn and fantasizing for so long that when the reality didn't match up to the porn, he wasn't able to keep the excitement going.  As you can imagine, that didn't do great things for my self-esteem.  I began to feel anxiety about initiating sex, because even if he was in to it, would we even be able to consummate?  

My other main issue continued to be his insistence that I do the bulk of the work for our sex life.  He needed me to be spontaneous.  In order for him to get turned on, he needed me to initiate, to act sex-hungry, to surprise him with sexy costumes.  His favorite thing was to come home from work and find me already tied up in bed, waiting for him.  I did this several times and he always enjoyed it.  
But there's only so much I could do myself.  We had cuffs that I could put on myself, but obviously I can't do any intricate rope work on my own arms/torso.  Also, surprising him with sex was great for him, but it was still work for me.  I had to plan my costume, put it on, wait for him to come home....that's all work for me.  I did enjoy the sex, but it wasn't spontaneous for me, I had to plan for that.  

I would come home from work, shower, make dinner, and want to relax a bit.  He would either want to jump me as soon as I got home (since he was high and horny) or he would want something to happen later.  I tried to communicate to him that I would be more likely to be in the mood for sex if dinner were already made when I got home; more time for me to relax and get into sexy times.  I rarely came home to dinner made.  

I began to resent the fact that sex was one more thing I was supposed to be in charge of.  I did most of the grocery shopping, most of the cleaning, most of the cooking.  I planned our social calendar and even family stuff (if we were traveling to his parent's for Christmas, I was the one deciding what day we would leave, how much time we should both take off work, emailing his mom about plans, etc).  Sex just became one more thing I had to take care of in our life, and since sex didn't pay the bills, I started to just not do it anymore.  He wanted to take video of us and put it up on an armature porn site to make money.  I was fine with the idea of it, honestly, but I was too busy to do more than show up.  This was his idea and his passion, so I wanted him to think of scenarios, get it prepped, and then we would do things together.  But all I got was more we need to do this! as in...I needed to help him do this.  He loves the intricate ties and knots, but hasn't had much practice doing it.  He would try something he saw online, not be able to master it right away, get frustrated, and then the mood was ruined.  I thought about looking up to see if there was a group or class in our area that we could attend together, but then I thought, why is this my job?   

He began to resent my lack of enthusiasm.  I would get snide comments about not dressing up for him.  If I tried to initiate normal sex, I'd get rebuffed because he wasn't in the mood.  Not all the time, but enough to make me fear rejection.  We would fight about it...how he needed the surprise element, the dressing up.  There were also some things he liked that I realized I didn't.  He liked the idea of leaving me alone tied up.  I wasn't OK with that.  I didn't articulate that for the longest time, and that was totally my fault.  

We got into another huge fight.  I finally let a lot of my hidden resentments out.  He felt betrayed...like I'd been lying to him this whole time.  And I sort of was, by omission, by not expressing myself.  For the longest time,  I thought that I was doing the right thing by just going along with some stuff that wasn't that fun for me but wasn't a hard boundary, either.  And I did enjoy how much he was enjoying himself.  Seriously, it was a turn-on to see him turned on.  But I should have communicated more.  I should have shared with him when something made me uncomfortable instead of letting my resentment build internally.  The whole thing was such a touchy subject, and the arguments were circular.  I felt like I had to be in charge of our sex life on top of the rest of our life; he needed me to be the planner because spontaneity and surprise was a vital part of the kink.  And on and on and on. 

We are at a stand-still right now.  Deciding if this is a deal-breaker.  He wants someone who can be fully in to his kink.  I think he wants an experienced submissive, someone who can teach him how to be a Dom and plays the submissive role the way he imagines it in his head.  I've grown a lot and learned a lot and tried a lot, but there are some things I'm just never going to be OK with and, more to the point, some things I just don't want to continue to put the effort in to.  I like the idea of a dominant man, but part of the appeal of that is the he takes control of everything; not just the sex, but the scene, the expectations, the materials, etc.  

If you've made it this far, I congratulate you.  I guess I'm looking for perspective here.  Am I being selfish?  Is he?  Are we both assholes that should just get divorced?  We have been together so long, and have been round and round this issue so much, that I don't have my head on straight anymore.  Any perspective would be appreciated.  

tl;dr  Husband into bondage and needs to be dominant wants me to do the bulk of the work in figuring out costumes, scenarios, etc.  Resentment on my part, am I just being selfish and lazy?

EDIT: A lot of people are asking what he does for me.  He always makes sure I get off during our sexual encounters.  As I've gone through this process, I realized that I actually do like the same rough sex that he likes and I like the idea of being submissive to his Dom; ideally I'd like for us to plan a scenario ahead of time, have him set it up, and have him tell me what to do.  I like the idea of being wanted so badly that he takes me, and there are a lot of things that he's introduced me to or we tried together that I really like and have turned in to my own fetishes/kinks.  So, when sex happens, I enjoy it.  But right now it's that he wants me to think of the scene, set it up (dressing up, getting equipment ready, etc) tell him what I thought of, THEN he would play it out.  I like being passive, which is counter-productive to being the one plans the whole thing out.  Also, I'm totally able to enjoy myself when the sex is vanilla; the kink is fun but not necessary.  He mostly NEEDS some element of the kink to get going/finish the deal, and I end up not feeling sexy enough for him if I try to initiate without any of the trappings of the kink.

I have a very close female friend. We met via online dating almost 2 years ago and have been friends and lovers ever since [not lovers during other committed relationships]. We're somewhere in between FWB and a full on relationship, and are on the level of closeness where we're comfortable saying 'I love you.'


Over the last couple months, her and I have been spending more and more time together. Our friendship has the feeling of a relationship in the post-honeymoon period. Comfortable and low-stress plus we're both happy with ourselves and the other person. 


As part of our continued closeness, I invited her to a party to introduce her to my friend group. At the party, a friend referenced her as my girlfriend, and we kindof laughed it off and explained that we were just friends. The night continued with fun and games and drinking, but there was a little bit of a shift in how my female friend was being treated. I guess that's to be expected when someone goes from being 'OP's girlfriend' to 'single' over the course of a party.


Female friend and I headed back to my place, and on the way she mentioned 'I think 3rd friend likes me...'. I'd noticed the same at the party and we joked about it for a while before turning in for the evening.

---  
Fast forward a few days.  Female friend and I are making dinner and she tells me that 3rd friend has really been chatting/txting with her a lot. It's pretty apparent from his messages that he wants to take her out... and that he doesn't realize that her and I are actually more than 'just friends.' Female friend and I mull over what to do for a long time and eventually decide that I need to meet up with 3rd friend and let him know what's up with her and my relationship.


He and I meet up the next night for drinks and I fill him in. Her and I are friends and lovers, but not exclusive to each other and with the emphasis on being friends more than being lovers. He asks some questions about whether I'm actively pursuing a relationship with her, and I respond that I am not [because I'm very happy with the state of our relationship already.] I told him that this dinner meeting was not a 'cease-and-desist' as much as it was meant to be informative.


My biggest concern going into this is that some bonds of friendship are going to end up stressed. 3rd is also a close friend of mine and I'd hate to do anything to ruin that bond. Because of that, towards the end of our dinner [and after a couple of introspective drinks], I asked him if he'd do me a favor and not pursue her romantically. There's a lot of jealous/unhappy ending/stress potential from two close friends being intimate with the same girl, and I wanted to maintain the 'relationship status quo.'  He was pretty unhappy with this, but he agreed. I walked away feeling that his temporary pain from this loss outweighed the alternative pain of stressing multiple relationships.

---  
Fast forward a few more days. Female friend is coming over to my place. We're going to make a fancy dinner, read some books, and study some organic chemistry [not a euphemism]. She calls me to tell me she's coming over, but her voice sounds a little weird; she isn't her usual bubbly self. She walks into my apartment and says 'OP, I have a confession to make... 3rd invited me to wine country with a group for the weekend and I went.'


It's really hard to get me riled up, but this set my stomach churning into a uncontrollable feeling stew of jealousy/betrayal/sadness. In my mind, 3rd had said one thing to me, and then done the exact opposite. Very not cool.


They'd had a great trip, and had a lot of chance to chat about this weird triangle we'd created. They want to get to know each other more, but don't want it to put strain all all the attached friendships. They're both awesome people and I think they'd be great friends, but in this situation someone's inevitably going to end up feeling hurt.


She and I chatted a ton and we realized that the choice fell to her. The least painful path is that they get to know each other more and find that they aren't really compatible. The most painful path is that he or I get into a committed relationship with her, which strains the other relationships because of the 'he is better than me' or 'she chose him over me' thought processes.

---  
I care a ton for both of my friends. They are two of my favorite people and they deserve the best in life. He and I are grabbing another dinner tonight to catch up on our thoughts/feelings and we're all working to keep an open dialog while this nonsense is going on. Reddit... what am I missing? Is there an easy solution here? Or some perspective I could take to help figure this out?

106023,Relationships,29i6u2,"I've recently moved in with my boyfriend of 1 year. A few things I'm becoming seriously irritated by:

1. He will pick his nose and flick the bogeys onto carpets/surfaces etc

2. He does that same when picking spots on his face, flicks scabs onto the floor

3. He doesnt know how to clean, hoover or dust. If I didn't clean, everything would be disgustingly filthy, like the toilet and the carpet.

4. Instead of throwing toilet rolls away after they're done, he will just chuck the empty cardboard on the floor and let it accumilate until I pick it up.

5. He leaves his washing and ironing until the last minute and lets it pile up on the floor.

6. He will sometimes not shower for 2+ days. I never noticed this before as I assumed he used to shower before seeing me, but it's really starting to get to me because it's gross and his whole manly area smells of cheese.

7. He lets dishes pile up around his computer and won't bother tidying them away.


Sometimes I feel like his mother. I haven't discussed any of these issues with him yet because I don't want to nag him about it. I want him to have enough self respect to be clean and clean the area around him. But apparently he doesn't have that. So I don't know what to do!!! I seriously cannot take this anymore!!

79932,Relationships,394kqn,"Background: I am 22 and my boyfriend is 33. We have been together for 8 months and living together for 6. Our relationship is fantastic and we are best friends. Just one problem. 

So my boyfriend got a new, great job in March. He works Monday through Friday 8:30am-5:00pm and has every weekend off. I work 3:00pm-11:00pm full time but with my schedule I have one day off a week and every other weekend off. The day off during the week is random. So as you can see, by the time he gets home I have left and by the time I get home he's in bed. So we can go days without seeing each other. 

We get along great. We do argue sometimes but normal people living together do. The issue is that our communication is suffering because of the lack of seeing each other. And sometimes it feels like we're roommates. When we argue we don't want to do that over text, we would rather talk in person, but when we don't see each other for 5 days in a row that's really hard. Then when we do see each other we don't want to deal with that and just want to enjoy our time together. We don't grocery shop together either, we have to do parts at different times. It's just small stuff like that that make us feel like we don't live a joint life together if you know what I mean. 

The only option I see at this point is for me to get a new job. The only problem with that is that I love my job and my friends and coworkers there. I haven't even been there a year yet. I actually have real connections with these people and that's never happened to me at a job before. I really, really don't want to leave. He just got his new position in March and it's such a great opportunity for him so asking him to get a new job is not an option.

35851,Breakups,1wohj7,"This is a long story but I need some advice on it.

I started dating my girlfriend when I was in high school. She was awesome, we were always very happy with each other, but had our fights and stupid immature break ups that people go through in high school. We always found our way back to each other however.

Now in college, we both got a little more busy but still loved our time together. But things were feeling different and I started losing sight of myself and worrying that I was too dependent on her and vice versa. I was scared that I wouldn't be able to be on my own and it started getting me really down. I feel like this started driving her away even more which in turn, made me sadder. I just broke up with her a few months ago for these reasons and she didn't take it all that well.

We have talked a few times but she stated about a week after we broke up that she had moved on, which i think was a lie, that she did not want to try us again if the time came that i was ready for this relationship.

I went through the tough break up feelings and was pretty upset about it, but I respected that she didn't want to be friends understandably and found myself writing things down in a journal that I wanted to tell her, instead of being an idiot and breaking no contact. 

Anyways, I am a lot happier with MYSELF right now. I feel like i am a lot more secure with myself as an individual. I was immature for much of our relationship and I feel like I've grown up a lot through this breakup. I still love her and think about her.

Should I try to ask for her back, or do I need to just leave her be and not even try?

5031,Infidelity,2vogkl,"So I have been seeing this guy seriously for a month. We are both in college and have spent hours on end with one another, so while I was with him for the shortest amount of days, I felt as if I knew him better than some other guys I had been with for months. We became really close really quickly and told one another everything. 

It has been awhile since I've been open to a relationship after I was broken up with painfully in November, and I didn't expect to like this guy so much. I explained to him that I had been cheated on before and so I was admittedly paranoid and probably overly jealous at times. He understood and told me he wasn't that type of guy and if we wanted things to work I had to trust him. I told him I wanted something serious, because I was tired of getting hurt. We agreed to be exclusive.

So he and I are quite opposite which is why I was surprised we connected so well. He's on a club sport team at the university so he parties a lot, works out all the time and just basically fucks around. I am working towards law school, the parties I go to are usually pretty chill and more of kick backs and so on. 
Basically, we agreed on the weekends we'd do our own things and then meet up either later in the night or the following day. 

This was amazing for both of us the first few weeks. But this past weekend after a party where he didn't return til 5am, I was worried, but didn't say much. I went to his room and joined him in bed for about an hour (just sleeping) and then we did homework together.

 I got a call while we were sitting together from a friend of a friend who I have only met once. She explained she saw him grinding up on another girl shirtless and making out with her, and when she approached him and asked about me he said, I mean we aren't really dating so it doesn't matter. I packed my stuff up and told him we were done. 

He has been apologizing but also tried to turn it on me saying I made him feel pressured to date me. My rationalization of this was that 1) he agreed to be exclusive with me; while that isn't dating, it pretty much implies it and 2) Grow a pair and break up with me, don't cheat on me

He's been apologizing incessantly and he hurt me more than I've ever been hurt before. I see him everywhere and my friends have been trying to keep him from knowing where I'm at at all times. 

I want so badly to have what we had before, and he has stated that countless times in our arguments, but I know that just can't happen after what he did. I want to be his best friend again, but I don't think I can do it without wanting to be his girlfriend again.

181790,Dating,20eauh,"We've been dating for a few months. Started out slow, seeing each other occasionally (our schedules are completely opposite so we don't have a lot of spare time together). We have had a bit of a rough history, being close to dating before but sort of drifted apart. Have always had a spark though.

Anyway, getting to the point of this. In the last few weeks, in general conversation she would bring up bits about her past with guys, like ""that reminds me of this guy i had a thing with..."", etc. It's usually just random little snippets of it in conversation, but the other night she just wouldn't stop talking about it, even when i was dropping hints that i wasn't impressed.

Later that night she texts me, and I tell her i wasn't comfortable hearing about that sort of stuff. She understood, admitting she kind of went off like how she talked to her girlfriends, and that she probably needs to learn when to shut up haha. I don't really get why she was telling me those things.

So yeah, just trying to get an outside perspective on this. If any more info is needed, i'm willing to provide. This is my first relationship and it's making me a bit anxious thinking about this sort of stuff.

34478,Relationships,2j5465,"So I met an intensely intelligent, musical, gorgeous man a year and a half ago. We hit it off right away and dated for a month, I jumped into things a bit too fast only to be told that there was a girl from his hometown who he had been in love with for a couple years. He told me he'd be leaving in another month to work there and to be with her. After some flash grieving I told myself and him that I could enjoy him until he left and then just let go. Suffice it to say it was painful when he left. I didn't hear from him for a couple weeks after which he texted me saying I'm sorry, I made a mistake. He ended up returning to be with me after a month away. He never slept with her, apparently it awkward and he realized it wasn't going to work.

Shortly after this, I stumble upon nude photos being exchanged between them, him sending her romantic love letters, saying things to her that he had never said to me. I realized that he needed time to work through it and move past her, so I stayed. This has continued with her and other girls basically from the start.

Through the first six months of our relationship, I was feeling some pretty concentrated hurt over this but I knew that what we could have was something worth waiting for so I stuck it out. Through my eyes it just looked like she was being manipulative/didn't want to lose having someone in love with her. She doesn't want a romantic relationship with him, but says that they are best friends. It just seems like she strings him along though.

We have rehashed this over and over with him concluding that getting photos from her/other girls is purely sexual and he only loves me (which is truly not comforting to me), and it's an impulse he has a very difficult time controlling. I believe and understand all of these reasons but they do not change how much it hurts me. When this happens at first he is compassionate and tries to work it out, but if I am upset for more than an hour he reacts in a passive, dismissive, frustrated way that makes me feel like it is my responsibility to stop feeling hurt.

I think it's important to note, I am pansexual and we bring other women/couples into our relationship sexually. There is one girl who lives far away that we met this summer. We all send photos and sexy texts in order to enjoy each other as much as we can long distance. She is beautiful, amazing and respectful of our relationship. I am completely happy and comfortable with this, it feels like a whole different ball game. I don't expect complete monogamy but I do expect honesty and sharing, I need everything out on the table. I couldn't handle a poly or open relationship. As soon as its hidden, sneaky, I don't know the girl and she doesn’t know us as a couple, it becomes painful for me.

In the last six months things have began to feel a lot more serious and stable. Before it seemed clouded as we were both in difficult transitional parts of our lives. We got off to a more very rocky start. Except he can't stop doing this, and I can't accept it, and we need some outside advice.

Am I overreacting to all of this? What is the appropriate response for both of us?

29006,Relationships,3h9k13,"My ex-bf/bf (we are on and off consistently) met over 2 years ago at work. We started our relationship 6 months after meeting each other, but kept it secret. I was junior employee and he had recently been promoted to a senior position. Since I work in a male-dominated field, I ask to keep it secret because I wanted to avoid the rumours, assumptions etc. There were no HR concerns with us dating as we were in different departments. We dated for almost 8 months and had a great relationship, he had met my parents, siblings and entire extended family. I had yet to meet his. He comes from an Indian background and I am not, so he said his parents needed sometime to accept the fact that he wasn't with an Indian girl. I didn't think much of it, until Christmas time when he broke up with me because his parents were so unhappy with my race and religion, and had threatened to disown him if he didn't end our relationship. 




I was pretty heartbroken, but accepted it for what it was and moved on. We didn't speak for 4 months. Afterwards, he asked to go for coffee and explained that he missed me and even though his parents kept trying to set him up with Indian girls, he didn't like any of them. He said his parents will come around, and me being foolish and thinking with my heart accepted what he said and we got back together. We dated for about 9 months, until he was thinking about buying a house and asked me to move in with him. He lived at home, which I always found very odd for his age. Luckily, I lived on my own so he was constantly over at my place. But he would often have to leave super early in the morning, as he couldn't tell his parents he was staying over at a girls place. When we were looking at places, he mentioned that he required a suite in the basement because his parents wanted to live with him. Uhhh what!? This was the last thing I was expecting, he was confused that I was so shocked. He thought that I was going to be okay with it, when I am definitely not. I don't want to move in with my boyfriend....and his parents. He said it was a deal breaker for him, and that he had to have his parents live with him. I said I wasn't willing to do that, they could live next door or down the street but not in the same house. So once again we broke up, I asked him not to contact me and luckily was going on a leave from work and left the country for 3 months. I just got back a few weeks ago, and he sent me this long message, about how he loves me and that he was super harsh with what he said and that he wants to compromise on the living situation with his parents etc. A few days later, we were at a work event, alcohol was involved and we ended up going home together. He is really keen on making things work, and wants us to get back together. His best friend (we work together as well) and I went for coffee and he said that my ex really does love me, but that he is unsure that he will ever be willing to leave his parents.




At this point, I am just exhausted. We've been on and off for 2 years, I still have yet to meet his family and he is consistently acting like they will accept our relationship, only to turn around and follow what his parents say when that are unaccepting. I understand that family always comes first, but his family clearly doesn't want us to be together.




I know that I should just move on, and that he isn't the one. But another part wants to ask him to move out WITHOUT his parents, and when that happens we can try to date again. Is that a stupid request?

Please forgive this post if it's semi incoherent, i'm going to try to get it all out.  My fiance and I have been engaged for 2 months, and together for a little over 3 years. When we first got together I found a video of his ex masturbating on his ipad (when I was using it to take notes for a work meeting FML) and consequently found that he was chatting provocatively &amp; sending dick pics to this girl he was seeing for a short bit. We ended the relationship after this incident. A few months later we decided, with the assistance of a counselor to get back together. Things have been great since then. It took time and a lot of hard work, but we got to a place where I could feel like I trusted him again. We blended our families (he has 3 kids from a previous marriage), got engaged and just moved into a new home... like just moved this last weekend...

Well last night I heard his phone go off at 3am. We have mutual friends and none of them would be texting that late. So, I checked his phone. Yes, I snooped but I'm not feeling entirely bad about it at the moment. Well I couldn't find what set off the notification, so I dug more. Come to find out that he had KIK Messenger installed as a hidden app and was chatting it up with this chick for the last two weeks. The last thing he sent her was a picture of his dick with cum on the tip. She sent multiple pics to him as well. I woke him up, confronted him and told him he needs to pack enough clothes for him and his kids to last him until Friday (I own the house, I didn't feel like I should be the one to have to leave). I let him know I will pack the rest of his things and bring them to his mother's.

91030,Relationships,24i0sb,"*warning* - well, this is about to be long. Terribly long! You can skip most of it - I'll mark down less important part.

Basically, it all started out in a high school, as our first 'true' love, you surely know that type of relationship. First sex partners, learning how to live in a long-term relationship and so on. We actually broke up after our exams, being one and half a year in. The reasons mainly originated from her jealousy about things that never happened (I had a friend, but my relationship with her was nowhere near what she had imagined. They hated themselves and I would never cut her away, just because it'd be against my common sense - I probably couldn't live with thought, that I've ended absolutely nondangerous friendship only because of constantly growing suspicions. I somehow preferred to talk with that friend though, as she was far more intelligent than my GF - TBH we'll be coming back to her in a sec). Meanwhile she was using her charm to make me jealous, being the prettiest girl in school she always had boyish circle around her - and she used it pretty frequently to make me feel bad. One more big thing to mention - neverending resentful bringing up things that we've closed months ago and we didn't even remember them completely - only to put that another needle in my body.


**--rest of backstory - you can skip--**

It was after several crises, when she promised to change her attitude to me, forget about previous fights and so on. And - just to make it clear - I wasn't perfect at all too, made some mistakes and all, but frankly it seems to be minor compared to her behaviour. 
I didn't believe her when she made another promise, when I finally managed to break up with her, right after continuous two-week argument, that she never meant to stop. Here we come to another trait of her - she'd never stop an argument, before someone's guilt is settled. Well - this led to things like rolling out an full 3-hour onslaught that began with simple difference in minds. I'd really love to end such senseless arguments in 15 minutes - as they didn't deserve to be any longer, nor did they have to be ended up in conceding to other person's point. Her way to handle this though, was to force me to stay or not to disconnect a call, when I wanted to give it a break (it would really end it), running over same arguments from both side for prolonged time, me losing my temper after ca. 30 minutes up to one hour of this nonsense. Again, digging out old, closed problems and so.


Coming back to that breakup, what made me to do this was myself standing in the kitchen, crying, being absolutely mentally shattered, with a knife in my hand that I was really close to stab myself with. I've made my decision back then, ending this misery. We were good for first like 8-10 months, then the characters of both came to sunlight. 
Roughly a month after, we went into another largescale fight, when she was me with beforementioned friend. We were just talking (note: I've never met her outside school when I was with my GF, this was like our 2nd or 3rd meeting) and it made her rage enormously. 
And after that fight, I started to actually hate her, being neutral and still concerned about her before. With the hatred, rest of my feelings have gone.


To put following months short - I've made a bad decision to hook up with that friend, I had to leave her after 2 months, because my feelings for my ex were too strong.
Guess what then - yes, I tried to come back to my ex. She was hating me for being in relationship with that friend, so it end up in me begging her.
Meanwhile, she used to go to clubs every 3-4 times in a week (it was our 5-months holiday between exams and start of university), she had met a foreigner that was about to come to see her again. Right before his arrival, she told me, that she still loves me, wants to be with me and she doesn't want him to come. Two days later I've received a SMS with info, that she's with him.


Two weeks later we've met and had sex, she broke up with him (well, that wouldn't work out for them anyway). My feelings were still hurt anyway, so it took another month until we finally got to agreement. What is worth to mention now - I've ended up with my former-friend-then-ex-then-friend-again in same student group on an university. So my GF was worried about it and I'd never let her come back, before she agreed to this - I forget about her ex, she forgets about my ex, we start with tabula rasa. It worked for like one month? She shortly started to question me again, throwing another suspicions all around.


Truth is, I should've ended this back then. You know, we broke up for a reason, and this reason started coming up again. It wasn't really about that friend, because later, when this issue somehow settled down a little she found another girl to be jealous about - again without any sensible reason.
Some months later after comeback, she made me show her my conversation with that friend, being mad about me speaking with her every 2-4 days, though we again *couldn't* meet outside university (and I had to remember - choose another bus (though she lived next tome), never sit with her, irrational bullshit such as ""if only you can - choose a single free seat, so when she comes, she can't sit next to you, but if she does - change your place"". I don't have to tell you that I of course didn't obey those ~~abusive~~ rules). Problem escalated, she threatened me again with breakup if I don't stop my contact with her etc.


At this point I was so filled with guilt, however unreasonable it was, that I felt that it was my fault and I can't let her go, at the same time didn't wanting to hurt my friend that never did anything wrong (neither we had closer physical contact - nothing that I wouldn't do with everybody else). She had BF for a while, too.
I managed to make my GF believe that I minimised my contact with her, preserving it pretty well in reality (it diminished some months into my friend's relationship, it's pretty normal). 


Ah, forgot to mention, me and my GF live in distant cities since the new beginning, we're meeting every one or two weeks.
And a quick note - our sex life became disaster after coming back. I had to beg her into anything, I could forget about having sex twice on a same weekend. Right now it's like once in a month. Not PIV. Maybe as much as handjob/fingering/oral. She has no medical or psychical reason for that, just to mention.



**--end of backstory - read again from now on--**

But well, when problems with my friend generally came to an end, I was still filled with guilt and she never stopped to make arguments outta nothing, just because she had bad mood (or bad character, I still can't decide).
Another few months later, I just mentally broke down. I stopped caring about my studies (short mention: prolly hardest technical studies on best uni in country, pretty challenging, even for me). Every minute that I wasn't somewhere out, I've spent in bed, playing games, drinking shitloads of alcohol, eating tons of sweets or sleeping. 


One month living like this, I went to birthday party of my 3 years older friend. (note again: I'm pretty attractive man, life and sould at parties, never had problems with finding someone to flirt with, etc.) We were all pretty drunk and went out to the club. I've danced with the jubilee, it went pretty hot and she wanted to kiss me. I backed off, as I didn't feel like doing this to my girlfriend. But being pretty experienced with men, the girl told me one thing - to think my life over. And I did.


My GF dropped off university to chase her dream of becoming a physician. She has to pass her highschool exams again. And I'm helping her with her maths exam, as she passes it for the first time. Every single week from the beginning of this year, we've spent like 2-3 x 3 hours on learning. Nothing else. Really, 95% of our face-to-face contact was maths. (Sidenote: I know she's under big stress right now, I'm fully aware of that, as she's 2 years behind with university and is unsure of success. But it's not the reason for all this, she's just like that). This was another pin to the coffin.


Back to the story - one month later (end of January) I went to another party with that girl. Prior to this I've thought thoroughly over my relationship and kind of decided to end it after my GF's exams, when I'll do what I can to help her. 
We went on pretty hard at the party itself, being surrounded by all our friends from university. We talked about sexual tension between us, which was pretty strong since that dance in club. And she *attacked* me, we kissed, she wanted to have sex with me, but I rejected her (well, I'm not that much of a cheater). In following months nothing big happened, we kissed maybe once more, danced and touched a little, she has scruples about romancing with occupied boy, as well as I do about cheating.

She was what kept me alive for this period to this moment. Feeling that I'm not bound to the only girl, that makes me miserable.


That time wasn't that bright at all anyway. Fights never stopped, I've almost killed myself driving back from her house 140 km/h in conditions, in which no one should drive more than 60. Not to mention curvy road, eyes filled with tears and milions of thoughts in my mind. And this happened multiple times.
I can tell that I'm depressed. Right now it's rather OK, since I'm not having breakdowns too often, but it's been really bad several times and I owe my life to my another friend, that helped me to fight with suicidal thoughts.


I really wanted to simply scream out my mind to her and end it as soon as possible, but I didn't want to ruin her exams and her life. I just sat there taking those hits again and again, over minor things or topics closed really long time ago. 
She plans to spend the rest of my life with me and I know she won't let me go easily. One important thing is that she can't take a look at the relationship from a larger perspective. If we don't fight for two weeks - our relationship is perfect, no matter that we argued for three weeks straight just before these two. She negates all the bad things that happened, telling me that I forgot how it was and I'm making up things just to make her feel, that our relation is bad.
Well, it's untrue. I was writing down at least the major fights since January and there have been a lot of them, mostly over simply stupid issues.


She has her exams in two weeks and I'm nearly convinced to end it as soon as she puts down her pencil. I'm just afraid I won't have enough strong will to do this. At the moment I hate her. I have trouble staying by her side for three hours, because I'm on verge of breakdown. (quick-endnote: whenever she came over to sleep at my apartment on university, we went into fight about something. I can't imagine living together...)

A little backstory on us, my girlfriend and I have been together a little over a year. We were pretty serious quick I guess, always seeing each other and such. We said I love you early too but we never looked back. This year is especially stressful, she is a double major in college while I took the work route in welding which I couldn't refuse, so obviously I don't get the stresses oF college, but I try my best to and be understanding. I will work with her on homework, look over her papers before she sends them in since she's dyslexic and doesn't want to send junk in so she'll just email me the papers and I'll look them over.

I do all I can to make this girl happy and stress free, but the moment I hiccup, its a full blown fight. So in recent events, she's been going out on fridays with her friends and I'll end up just hanging out with my friends but we used to always go to parties and things together. For the record, she isn't a wild girl, she will text me through the night and usually home early-ish so I don't think she's hiding stuff. I tell her though, that I feel we never go to these things together anymore and that it would be nice to be included as her friends even ask her why I'm never around at school much anymore. She says okay next time I'll invite you. That was last friday, this friday she says she's going out and holding my frustration inside, I ask if I should make my own plans, she says yes. Then I ask her today why I wasn't included after we already talked about it, she said I thought you were gonna do your own thing and that you were over that kind of atmosphere, I said no I asked to be included Now, we had plans tomorrow to hang out and already talked about what we were going to do and stuff. She says Okay well I wasted this time doing arguing with you and didn't get my homework done so I'm gonna do it tomorrow I said I thought we had plans tomorrow? She says I'm going to do it tomorrow, you can come friday, take it or leave it. Now I'm pissed and was like We weren't arguing and that makes no sense that we talked about this for not even 20 minutes and now it washes away our plans, its only 6 in the afternoon? She just loses it at this point and says maybe we should take a break and that the arguing doesn't help this and that I've said that there isn't love in this relationship so why be one? She says I stress her out and that sometimes it would be better if I wasn't there stressing her out more because this major (education and english) is her life and that I don't make it much easier sometimes.

She doesn't handle stress well and this could all be the stress talking, but it hurts to hear that a girl who is always talking about the years to come and our future say something like ending our relationship over a cheap argument. Another thing is, she's always doing stuff after school during the week. Grabbing lunch with her roommate, going to the mall with her Mom almost weekly now or grabbing lunch with her too, but if I ask to hang out, its I'm so busy and stressed with school. It hurts because her school isn't a state away, its like 20 minutes from where I work and where I live too. I know that everyone will say Dump her , lawyer up , Change your phone number, move to another continent No. I don't want to, this girl means so much to me, and she's proven time and time again that I mean as much, sometimes even more to her. She's always truthful to me and has never been shady and every time I have reason to doubt something, I'll do my snooping if I feel I should and it always comes up just how she said and I'm at ease. But this has me scratching my head. What do I do? I feel like I'm handling a ticking time bomb and if I say something wrong or do something wrong, its like pulling the wrong wire. Do I give her space for tonight, tomorrow? Do I say something that might put her at ease? Stressed out college girls, please help me, also everyone else's input is appreciated very much as well, thanks for reading this!

The woman I've been dating/engaged to/living with for nearly seven years is likely leaving me. There's part of me that knows that it's a good thing - over the last 14 months, she's cheated twice, lies constantly, and despite us being in therapy puts for the bare minimum effort to repair things. I'm getting everything and all our friends in the divorce, and I'm still utterly miserable. 


I've been overeating, binge drinking to the point that I have a feeling my liver is irreversibly damaged at this point, some days I sleep for 12-16 hours, some days (like today) I sleep for two and just sit here in bed watching The Office for the fiftieth time. 


I can't find motivation to write, to get up, to shower, to see friends. I don't want to do anything. I don't think I'm suicidal, but if I could just disappear I think I'd be ok with that. 


I don't feel like I can talk to my friends about it anymore. I'm glad they're taking my side and being supportive, but they aggressively dislike my girlfriend at this point, despite me trying to work on things. The negativity really makes me upset and angry. There literally isn't a single person in my life, friend or family, who doesn't tell me once a day Break up with her, it's for the best.


Last night I gave her an ultimatum - block the person she's cheating with on all forms of communication or don't bother coming home from work. I didn't expect her to come home, but she did. She showed me her phone where she blocked the person, but immediately followed it up with But I'm leaving anyways. I didn't beg her to stay, but for some reason she did anyways. We talked for a long time about a lot of things. She slept on the couch, and I'm lying in bed typing this. 


I hate myself and everything. I don't see a light at the end of the tunnel. I don't do single well, and everyone says it gets better, it's going to be ok, but struggling with bad chronic depression, anxiety disorder and all the shit we all hear all the time along with this.... It's just icing on the cake. I don't feel like it's going to be ok.

182399,Breakups,2haky6,"I posted about this very recently here, but as there has been a new development, I need to vent.

I'm not going to bore you with the details of our relationship. It was about 2 years, on and off. We both ended it for various reasons, but ended up falling back together. There was never abuse, cheating or trouble. It was never mean, we never fought - It was simply that we were in very different places, at very different times. I felt like I couldn't date when he wanted too, and he felt like he couldn't date when I wanted too. It was an absolute mess, and we did our best at making it messier then it should have been. I have been in plenty of relationships, I have planned marriage and children with other ex-boyfriends, and still, I have never felt the way that I did about him. I know, no matter what, he was the one for me.

Earlier this year, I initiated no contact. I was resolved in my head that regardless of how I felt about him being my person, that I couldn't continue with the up and down, the not knowing what was happening, the confusion. We were not in a good place before I initiated no contact, we weren't being terribly nice to one another (I attribute this to stress, as neither of us were acting the way that we wanted to around one another). He said some things to try to make me jealous, he had some of his friends add me to Facebook (I have never had him on Facebook, I'm a very private person and don't flash my relationships around). When I confronted him about this, his friend pretended that it was a 'random' add, and my ex denied all knowledge. After I tried to cut off contact once more, he put aside his pride one day and asked me to go see him. I didn't reply. This hurt him, and it all went downhill from there. He told me once more he didn't want to date. That it wasn't me he didn't want to date, he was just too fucked up. I didn't believe this, and I cut off contact for good.

So, here we are, a few months down the line and I still have not had contact with him. The first few months were uneventful. I saw him occasionally driving on a street nearby my house (He has no reason to be in this area), but I always found excuses for why he might be around. I was starting to feel okay, I had been asked out on dates, but had turned them down as I didn't feel it was right to start dating when I was coming out of something big. But I've never been the person to sit in my room, listening to sad music and crying. I tried my best to grieve, and move on. 

A few weeks later, I joined a dating site, just to put my feelers back out there and try to make some new connections. A really cool guy started talking to me, and we clicked pretty well. After talking for a few weeks, I realised he wasn't really my type, and we agreed to keep in contact and be friends. I was happy with this. He would message me everyday and we would talk about life. Sometimes he would tell me stories that I felt like I had heard before. I shrugged it off. That is, until one day, he told me a story that was just too coincidental. It was a story that my ex had told me exactly! I put it off as a coincidence, and thought no more of it. 

A few weeks later, he was out drinking one weekend. He was begging me, and begging me to come see him. Saying he just wanted to hang out with me, nothing more. **His friends wanted to meet me**, and he just wanted to see me. I turned him down, and was turned off by the begging when we had established we were friends. A few days later, we were speaking again. I did some digging, as I wanted to be safe, and I discovered he was in fact work friends with my ex. I cut off all contact immediately. I couldn't be sure that my ex was behind this, and even if he wasn't, I think it would be disrespectful to continue talking to him. He continued to message me, and I did not reply.

Not too long after this, my ex added two of my friends to Facebook. That he had never, ever met. In fact, I had only spoken about them, he didn't know them in large detail. I was floored. He has a fairly common name, so when it popped up ""So and so is now friends with so and so"" I had to go to his Facebook to make sure it was the same one. It was. And now that we had a mutual friend, I could see his 'Tagged' photos. He had been tagged in a photo, on the weekend, with the guy I had met on the dating site. They had been together when the guy from the dating site was messaging me begging me to go see him. I was blind with rage. But I said nothing, I did nothing, I just ignored and thought no more of it.

I've spoken to my close friends about this, who all know my ex and don't like him too much. They have all agreed mutually that there is some sort of game going on. Whether it is to push himself into my life, or to make his presence in my life known. See, we don't have a mutual group of friends, so it is not as though he can pop up in my life every know and then, and he would not risk his pride and make contact with me first. Instead, they believe, he wants to play games to get a reaction, or to do something to upset or hurt me.

The other day, I was out with one of my friends. She asked if he had added anymore of my friends recently. I said I wasn't sure, I had blocked him on Facebook. I unblocked him to check, and there are now photos of him together with another girl. His girlfriend, I guess. I felt absolutely numb. Not only because he had bounded to a new girl so quickly after all we had been through, but that he would post it on Facebook. See, we also spoke about how silly people look posting relationship issues and photos on Facebook. He is an intensely private person, as am I, and we always agreed that regardless of the person, there was no relationships on Facebook.

So, here he is, with a girlfriend, and it is all over Facebook. My friend (who is a keen social media stalker), told me to check all of his other social media sites, because she had a feeling. I did so, there was nothing of this girl on any other of his profiles. My friend, who I love dearly and is brutually honest, noted that she wondered if he had made it so evident on his Facebook, because he knows I could see it. He doesn't know that I know his other social media accounts, as I don't use them personally. I didn't think it personally, but she was pretty convinced. I told her that I was sure it was all just stupid coincidences, and I was looking into it because I was still reeling. But she was not convinced. To add to this, the dating site friend, messaged me that same day after I told him why I could no longer speak to him, and totally changed his tune. He began asking me if him and I would ever hook up, regardless of the fact that he is close friends with my ex. For the first time, I felt like I was being baited. 

I have since spoken to other friends, who have said the same. They whole heartedly believe that none of this is concidental, that there has been some sort of 'baiting' game going on, that I just haven't been sucked into just yet. They believe he probably does have a girlfriend, that it may have been on since we broke up, but that he's trying to push it into my face for some reason. They believe it is because none of this other attempts of making contact through another person with me have worked.

I'm going to do the best thing I can, and forget/ignore it, and continue trying to move on. I know in my heart I can't have someone like that in my life. But my question is.. Am I being crazy?

98001,Relationships,26xfi1,"I started my small company, bootstrapped and from scratch 2 years ago. It has been growing, albeit slowly, mostly because I'm running it as best as I can with the lean funds we have and doing all management (sales, marketing, etc) by myself. I'm not in debt, I have low overhead, and I maintain a profit balance every month. With the exception of vendors, my team working with me, including myself, are paid 100% commission based on our profits - such is startup life. But, being the founder, I typically invest my money back into the company more often than pay myself regularly.

We are passed the bootstrapped phase and need an investment. I'm just beginning a pivot. I've been talking to investors, looking for grants, developing new revenue streams, and decided to bite the bullet and apply for a business line of credit for upgrades and improvements to our strategy. 

It is incredibly stressful, and while at times I feel worn down, this is what I want to do with my professional life. I am not employee material.

My husband works from home and for a decent salary with benefits for our family (we have two kids in elementary). He's pulling in nearly 6 figures if we count commission and bonuses. We are not exactly ""rich"" and we're getting by with a nice roof over our heads in a great neighborhood, two cars, food in the fridge. We don't have the income for luxuries like lavish Disney vacations, clothing shopping sprees, and the like. Although we do save up enough for quarterly date weekends in another city - stay at a hotel, eat at expensive restaurants, pay for a sitter, and have a night on the town. I always make sure I cover some of the cost for this, too. But he is the breadwinner and has been for years.

When times are tough, I'm always able to rally and make sure we don't dip into savings. 

When he was unhappy with companies he worked for, I was always there to listen, hear why he's feeling frustrated, and support him in every professional decision he makes for himself. The times he's wanted to quit because he felt defeated, I held his hand and said, ""Do what makes you happy. We will be ok, we always are. We can make this work. Your happiness is more important than where you get your paycheck from."" 

And so I step it up, hustle for more sales, pull money out from my company to pay myself and make sure we're OK. I do this every time he's been laid off, too. While he's the one who keeps our ship sailing, I'm the one who makes sure we don't sink. 

Recently a national company proposed a merger of sorts with my company. We thought this was it and everything that I have been working for. Initial negotiations would have doubled our families income. Much like people do when they buy a lottery ticket, we thought of all of the great things we could do with more money. 

They rejected the initial offer. We renegotiated, still with compensation that would be great for our family. Now that offer seems to be getting rejected and they are whittling down the value to insulting levels (granted, we're still in negotiations). I feel like I'm getting dicked around by this corporation and at this point, I'm ready to tell them to f-off and go back to implementing my pivot plans. 

But now my husband is pretty much calling me a failure, demanding that I fold my company and get a job at Starbucks because ""it's better than nothing."" 

He saw what doubling our income could do and still has those lottery ticket-like dreams. I know he's tired of being the breadwinner. I would LOVE to do that for our family and I'm trying my best, it just takes time. I know my company isn't perfect, but it's not failing either. I know what I need to do to be better and I'm working on it. Close friends that know me and what I do say that folding is a huge mistake. 

We've been through hard times before and have worked through communication problems. We did years of marriage counseling when most would just get a divorce. It has been 7 years since we've hit a bump in the road this big. Our attempted discussion about this basically was his chance to shred me into pieces. Now we're ignoring each other for days because he's said many things that can't be unsaid. 

I'm feeling undervalued by my husband, and quite frankly, feeling like utter garbage. I've never wanted to give up on anything until now, and now I want to give up on it all. It hurts that I've been so supportive and in return I get kicked when I'm down by the person who's supposed to love me the most. 

How do I get back on track with him? I feel like another talk about this is just going to result in another massive fight, especially when I'm digging my heels in about trashing everything I've worked so hard on, and after the horrible things he has said. I don't know how to compromise on this.

I had a car but it was a bomb and after spending a few hundred on the damn thing a day later the mechanic told me when I bought it back in that it was so broken I was better off chucking it and saving up for a new car.

Fast forward 3 months (now) my partner and I saved up $2250 and bought a really good car. Like, this must have been a 1 in a 1000 because for the price it's really damn good. Yeah it needs a service and the breaks could do with a check (they're squeaky) but other than that everything is awesome!

And when I pulled up the driveway with it 2 weeks ago my mum and dad (my dad and I hate each other) inspected it and were really impressed and since then everyone has been super nice to me!

My older sister who is always abusing everyone and telling them how pathetic they are suddenly is nice to me and saying 'please and thank you'.

He even paid me $50 to drive him to work yesterday!

I wanted my family to be nice to me but this is not the way I wanted it. I know they're not proud of me but are eyeing off mine and my partners car. It's really uncomfortable.

188831,Relationships,32x8od,"So my girlfriend left the country a little over a month ago to work overseas at an NGO.  Before she left, we had talked extensively about our future plans and we both vocalized that we wanted to eventually marry each other.  She had been honest with me at the beginning of our relationship stating that we would eventually have to be in a LDR for a while as international development was her lifelong dream.  I was totally okay with that and supported her, however, I let her know that I had no intention of being in a LDR for too long of a time.  I told her I'm willing to do it for a year give or take a a few months.  She understood and respected what I was looking for.  So the plan we came up with was that she'd come back to the US in early/mid 2016 and find a job here.  We'd continue to work and save money for a wedding and get hitched in late 2016 or early 2017.  Then I was willing to travel across the world with her for her job.  I just wanted us to be together in the time leading up to a wedding for relationship/logistical purposes.  She agreed to this.


Fast forward to now: last night we FaceTimed and she was telling me that something she realized while she was apart from me was just how selfish of a person she was.  I asked her to elaborate and we talked about our future plans and she seemed really torn about returning back to the US in 2016 like we had originally planned.  She was hesitant about this plan before she left but she had told me that our relationship was the priority and so she was willing to act accordingly.  She loves her new company and the work she's doing and I've been nothing but supportive and enthusiastic for her.  So she doesn't want to return in a year and feels badly about it because she knows I've compromised and offered to globe trot with her for her job.


I let her know that it wasn't fair to me to have to wait to next year to find out whether we're going to be together or not.  She's in the advantageous position where she will get what she wants either way - if she stays overseas, she will continue to do the work she loves.  If she returns, there will be a 1 or 2 year pause in her career out in the field, but eventually she will resume because I will move my life for her.  So I asked her to make a decision soon - commit to returning in early/mid 2016 for our future or let's break up now before we get further invested.  Is this ultimatum fair or am I overlooking another route for this relationship to work?

67631,Relationships,30gujn,"My wife, Jane, and I have been married for 4 years now. We have been - and are - very happy with each other. I was a little naive as far as relationships were concerned when we first started dating, while Jane had had a relationship before she met me that was abusive. During this time, she met some friends online who she became very close to. She is still very close to them, and texts them everyday. One of them in particular is her best friend and very close to her.

I wasn't concerned about this, but I had a niggling doubt at the back of my mind that wouldn't quiet down, and I admit I erred and snooped through her messages. Most of her messages seemed to be her reaching out for some emotional support; the kind of support she always said I gave her. So it baffled me I saw her (what seemed to me) fishing for compliments from him. I also saw several messages where he was blatantly flirting with her; to give her credit, she would always reply I don't know how to respond to that and shut down, and the next message would usually be from him apologizing. But it bugged me that she never told him to stop doing it outright.

I was really bothered by it all day, and I confronted my wife after I came back home. She was angry that I snooped, even angrier that I didn't trust her, and told me that he was engaged to his long-term girlfriend and that he and his fiancee were happy together, that she considered cheating to be a dealbreaker for a relationship and would never, ever consider doing it, that she knew what an emotional affair was and that she was not involved in one. she told me he was her best friend and she had always confided in him when she was down, and I had no right to question that.

So it's now 2 in the morning and I'm sleeping on the couch. Am I paranoid for thinking my wife may be having an emotional affair, or are her actions normal? I don't mind grovelling if I'm in the wrong, but...if I'm right, I need to know too, right?

153846,Relationships,2e60ar,"Let's start off with some background info on my bf. I'm really sorry that this is a long post.
  
-BF (let's call him matt) is diagnosed with BPD.  
-He's been sober from drugs and alcohol for over 3 years.  
-Took some time off from college, although is currently attending again.  
-Suffers from constant anxiety and sleep issues.  
-Parents are divorced, mom is extremely controlling. Dad pays for everything.  
  
With this, I'm going to jump right into my problem, otherwise I feel like this post will be super jumbled. I often think about whether or not I want to break up with Matt. When I think that I do want to break up, I begin feeling selfish. I think of all the rough times he's been there for me (huge arguments with my mom, past depression, past break up with an ex, dropping out of high school, etc.). I feel like I can't abandon him, especially with his multitude of problems (which I'll list later). Another reason I feel selfish is that, to be honest, I don't have many friends. I have 2 best friends, and that's about it. Everyone else I know and am friendly with are HIS friends, and the idea of being cold-shouldered by them scares me. I'm defensive and judgmental when I meet new people--I don't give them the chance to reject me, usually because I reject them first. I care for him tremendously and truly love him...But here are my reasons why I sometimes want to break up with him.  
  
-He makes his anxiety my problem. I'M the only one that can make him feel better and relaxed, to keep his mind off things (which he tells me all the time).  
-During my 1st year of college (we had a LDR of about 3.5 hrs apart), he would constantly text me, wanting to know where I was and who I was with. If I didn't respond fast enough (say, anywhere between 10-20 mins), he would spam call me. He would apologize all the time for that, saying he missed me and that he was extremely lonely. Sometimes he'd get angry, other times he would just cry/mope. However, 2nd semester was not as bad as the 1st one (also because we had a long, hard chat about his behavior over winter break, as well as the fact that he was not on his meds when he should have been).  
-He would often over stay his visitation rights at my dorm. My school has a 2 day policy, anything more and you risk losing your housing. He would stay for up to 5 days sometimes.  
-While overstaying, he snooped. While I was in class, he went on my laptop (I stay logged onto FB) and went through my messages. I know this because I confronted him about it after the fact and he fessed up, but also because my best friend was jokingly messaging me that I don't love her anymore since I was clearly online and not responding. He also went through all of my text messages on my phone and questioned me about it.  
-One day I was in a bad mood and not very chatty. He aggressively texted my best friend, accusing her of knowing why I was upset (she didn't). He wanted an answer from her and wouldn't accept ""I don't know"".  He went off on her, asking her ridiculous questions to the point that when I heard what he did, I was FURIOUS.  
-It's at the point where I'm okay not texting him as much or seeing him too often. I don't miss him-he doesn't give me time to.  
-He cries about something at least twice a week. Whether it's an argument he had with his mom or about something work related (he's a barista).  
-He lies, A LOT. He lies about a lot of small petty things, but the lie that is the biggest concern is the debt he got himself into. He racked up a total of 10k. 8k was from recklessly spending, the other 2k is from his step mom's credit card. He claims he doesn't remember spending her money, and gets incredibly anxious/begins to cry if the topic is brought up.  
-He's manipulative. He guilt trips me all the time.  
  
My list is getting long, I'll try to wrap up quickly. These issues are only some of the problems, albeit the most important. All of his daily recaps with me (I seriously feel more like a therapist than a GF), emotional roller coasters, family and work problems, physical problems, and more, are getting the best of me. I feel so worn out. I also feel held back (he's my 2nd relationship, first one lasted for a little more than a year). I love him, but I find myself angry at him often. I'm beginning to resent him for the things he does. If I talk to him about a problem we have (for the most part, we communicate well), I hear about how he's working on it everyday, and that he's doing his best (I do believe he is, it's just not always enough). He has to keep me constantly updated with his thoughts and how they affect his behavior, and sometimes I just don't want to hear it. Any of it. At all.  
  
Looking back at this post, it's more negative than positive. The good thing about this relationship is that I can be my absolute self around Matt. He makes me feel the most comfortable and secure I could ever feel. 80% of the time I love being in his company. We have fun together, and I can't picture being without him. I really can't fathom being without him, but I also can't picture marrying him (which he's ""jokingly"" hinted at. I have absolutely NO interest in that yet).  
  
I guess that's all I can say for now. How do I talk to him about how I'm feeling? There is no way this can go well...And I leave for school again in about a week.  
  
Thank you, and I'm really sorry for the long post.

Joe's mother, who I'll call Nora, has been driving me crazy lately. Nora has a diagnosed mental illness as do I and Joe. Nora has always catered to all the boys, including her husband, coddled them since they were young. To this day, she still does the 21 and 23 year olds laundry. Every morning, she cleans the kitchen which has been left in shambles by the boys whom haven't either learned to put their dishes in the dishwasher or wash their dishes. 

Nora has opened her house to me in the last year. She and her husband have even decided to build Joe and I a basement apartment in their new house to give us the chance to get on steady footing before we move out on our own. As it stands, Joe and I share a 9 by 10 bedroom and Joe has his own office where he can work. 

Because they have opened their house to me, I do my best to keep clean and tidy. I do my own laundry, prepare my breakfasts and lunches as dinners are usually spent together with the family. Joe is not as tidy as I am. This is very apparent. I will typically clean the shared spaces, cleaning up after him, or telling him to get his ass in gear and clean up after himself. Though in the last while, my own mental illness has put me in hospital, and comprimised this usual ""clean up after Joe"" business. When I'm unwell, the best I can do is pick up after myself - I can't handle anything more. 

This has caused some frustration in the household. In the last week, I've been told that I have motivation issues twice; i.e., I'm lazy. In the last 2 weeks, Joe had confided in Nora a paranoid thought that was distressing to him, it was taken the wrong way and we were asked to leave. We took 1 week at my grandparents cottage about an hour away from the city to give some space to everyone. It was cut short due to financial issues and my fiancé wanting to go home. 

The main this is that everything is unclear. I do not understand what Nora's expectations are. They are constantly shifting. I've tried talking to her, only to have the expectations (i.e., what I should be contributing to the household in terms of chores or other responsibilities.) become something or return to their previous set of expectations.

I'm also confused because I seem to be the only other person making sure that these responsibilities are met. I can't seem to get Joe to clean up after himself, and I'm now constantly on guard for anything like last week where I might not have a home to come back to because I did see a glass that was left dirty on the counter or a pair of socks lefts on the ground. My fiancé can't leave right now and I don't want to not live with him.

Here's the story: I (25 F) ended a FWB situation with him (29 M) about a month ago. He had told me he had feelings for me but didn't want a relationship. I was awakened to the fact that he may have just been using me this whole time; he denies it and pleads with me to at least keep our friendship. He tells me he wants to be in my life, that he doesn't care if we never have sex again, that he values me as a person and doesn't want to lose me completely. I can't talk to him right now; we haven't spoken in weeks. I'm taking time to heal and think over everything. Began talking to  counselor. Things are getting better.

There's no point in harboring resentment, as it only brings me pain.

The problem with being friends is he still likes to sleep around and openly flirt with other girls. I get that's just how some people are; I try not to judge. I'm still jealous.

Sorry if this is confusing to read. This is my first ever post.

Ok so a little background, my friend and I have been buddies since the start of university are we were both 18 and 19 years of age when we first met. Recently we have both gotten married very close to one another's wedding date. I was her maid of honour and she was mine. She had a ""hippy"" wedding and I had a ""ranch"" wedding.
 
It has been over a month since I have gotten married and she has been avoiding me. I finally get her to tell me what is up and she says that my entire wedding and leading up to the day made her uncomfortable and she thought it was ""not me"". She said she did not want to talk about anymore wedding stuff and she knows it is selfish but she wanted a break from hearing about weddings.

I understand not wanted to her about silly wedding things, as I have no interest in decorations or flowers. However I more so thought this to be awful since I was there for her and completely positive about her wedding and never purposely ignored her, especially when huge things are happening in her life. Huge positive things that family and friends should be happy for...right?

I do not know how to react to what she has said. On one hand she is the closest friend I have, besides my SO. On the other, she has done things like this in the past. She makes what seems like petty issues out of changes in my life. My SO describes them as ""high-school issues"". 

For example:  she once told me I was a ""crappy friend""  because I had been hanging with my boyfriend (and now husband) a lot and ignoring her more than usual. Then once she finds a guy we can be closer friends again all of a sudden and she loves me like she used to.

A little about me...I am a quiet and simple girl. I do not like many aspects of traditional wedding days (ie: veils and pouffy dresses and glitzy crap). My friend and I are both artists and oil painters. We love talking about art, philosophy and mind bending subjects. I have never met someone who understood me emotionally and intellectually as she has. 

My wedding day was at a ranch and costed about 10,000 including absolutely everything. A planner came with the package and she decorated and facilitated every detail that I was not interested in figuring out myself. I started to get stressed just before the ceremony because I am a shy person and we had 100 people waiting to see me and adding the fact I have never been married before so something new and exciting/ scary. My friend said she had never seen me act like I did and thought I was turning into some bridezilla type glitzy person who needed everything perfect. I knew I was worrisome and stressing but I did not see myself as a different person. Just a person getting married in a few moments.

So my question to all of you is how do I handle this. At this moment I feel very upset that instead of being happy for me she is making me feel dumb for how my wedding made her uncomfortable and how it possibly did not reflect me. Do I tell her I do not want to be friends with her if she is going to act like this and criticize big changes that happen in my life?

**tl;dr** My artsy friend and I both get married and we are each one another's maid of honour. I am supportive to her and her wedding. She tells me last night she did not like my wedding and it made her uncomfortable after ignoring me for over a month after my wedding day.","Me [24 F] with my best friend [24 F] last night had a weird discussion about my wedding, she did not like how my wedding went down to my now [25 M] husband.",0.0,FALSE,103,77,1382018296.0,/r/relationships/comments/1on6dl/me_24_f_with_my_best_friend_24_f_last_night_had_a/,NonRomantic

So the people involved are as follows:

Me = Me (duh)

Roomate = ""JJ""

Good Friend = ""Stack"" or ""S""

Good Friend's roomate/our friend = ""Doc"" or ""D""

Doc's gf = ""Wheat"" or ""W""

Okay So we all just started college together, I moved in last thursday, but they all moved in earlier due to summer practices for different activities. The week before I showed up was apparently really stressful for Stack because Doc was constantly having his gf in their dorm and not telling S about it and then getting mad at S when he inevitably walked in on them doing the dirty. So I show up on thursday and things are already pretty stressful. I brought the TV for my room and it's better than the one they were using, so inevitably we transfer to JJ and I's room (right next door). Mind you these dorms are pretty cramped, so it's hard to have your own space when you have 5+ people packed in here. 

Now what started happening is at first it was just the four of us guys playing games together the first night, but then Wheat started showing up. Now I'm all for hanging out and trying to make friends with my bros gf's, hell they've done the same to me with my gf, we're all a happy little bunch. However, none of us get along with W, we just don't click, it's really awkward. This wouldn't and isn't really an issue by itself, I don't mind an extra body in the room as long as they aren't causing problems. However, she's constantly touching and squeezed up to and being overly cuddly and showing immense PDA (public display of affection) in the middle of the room at all times, it's weird. 

So these past fourish days have been spent with the three of us, JJ, S and I, growing more and more uncomfortable with it. It peaked this weekend when JJ, S, and I were playing smash bros in my room when S went to get some cookies out of his assumed empty room, only for JJ and I to be greeted by screaming from next door. S darts back into my room cookies in hand totally pale. He explains that he had walked into his room looking at his phone, got half way across the room and grabbed the cookies before he looked up and saw W giving D head on S's (!!!) bed. Stack booked it out of there and back into our room. No more than 30 minutes later W and D knock on my door and walk in all casually like nothing happened, and S just leaves while JJ and I sit there awkwardly. 

Today it got worse for me at least because I came back from my evening course and was tired and just wanted to sit down and watch some sportscenter or something on MY (important) Tv. About an hour ago I got to my dorm and opened the door, and W and D were sitting in the middle of the room playing the Last of Us on MY Tv and JJ's ps4, and JJ isn't even in the room. I'm just beyond done with all of this shit by now so I slide past them and sit down at my desk to study. They're making a big hubbub and distracting me so I start making comments about how stupid some of the people's actions are at the beginning of the game, until D pauses it, looks me dead in the eyes and says ""I'm not going to play this if you keep making comments and ruining the experience for me, so will you just stop being such an annoyance?"" I just stared at him and put my headphones on (Beats because they're loud and sound leak like a bitch) and crank up the loudest and most annoying heavy rock I have on my phone until they left about 20 minutes ago. 

So my question is how do I address this, and is it right of me to just tell them to get out the next time it happens?

89929,Dating,231xoj,"So here's my situation. We've been dating for about a month. We've been absolutely best friends since we met about 5 months before that. I've never clicked with someone like this before, or had this much chemistry with someone. He's the perfect person for me. I have no doubt in my mind that I'm supposed to be with this guy.

But here's the thing.

He just got accepted into his dream school ... more than 1500 km away.

Now, he's not 100% sure if he wants to go yet. I know if we weren't dating, he'd be preemptively buying plane tickets for the fall because he'd be so excited about his new life.

I want him to go. I really do. I am so happy for him because I know what getting accepted means to him and I know how hard he worked for this. I want him to go and I want him to follow his dreams and I want him to have an awesome life.

I feel like a selfish asshole for thinking anything other than supportive thoughts. I've told him over and over since he got in that if he decides to move in the fall, I will be totally behind him and we will make it work.

I mean it when I say it. I really do believe we could make it work. There are worse things than being apart from someone for 9 months, I know.

But holy shit, I miss him when we're apart for a day. How can I go months without seeing him? We're going to be apart for the summer (like 250 km apart, see each other on weekends), and I was already dreading that. I was so looking forward to coming back for school in the fall and being with him all the time again. I don't want him to leave me here. 

I trust him, I trust our relationship. We could do it. I keep telling him I'm fine with it. But I just don't know if I actually want to. 

I love how easy our relationship is right now. Not in the lazy way, I just like the how simple loving him is. We don't play bullshit mindgames, we just hang out when we want to. I love things how they are. I love it when he spontaneously comes over for 30 minutes before going to his friend's house. I love picking him up and going to look at dogs at the shelter together. I love going to parties with him. I love going for beers after work on a Tuesday. I love not having to meticulously plan every single time we encounter each other. I'm not looking forward to this summer for that reason, I can't imagine how awful 9 months of that would be. 

Nothing about having a long distance relationship appeals to me. I want to cry every time I think about it. Honestly, part of me feels like it'd be easier to just break it off now and spend the summer apart, and save myself the heartache of missing him when he leaves. I hate myself for even typing that, but I feel so hopeless when I think about him leaving that it almost feels like the best course of action. Ugh.

I need some counseling, you guys.

13133,Non-Romantic,1uzvfe,"SO, long story short my girlfriend has a child, age 2, from a past ex. The ex rarely visit her daughter, but majority of the time he is there to sort of flirt a bit with my girlfriend, he does not know she is seeing someone, mainly afraid he will do something crazy.

 So, pretty much my girlfriend is a little into debt with her college, she never finished it because she got pregnant. It really is not that much, but it will grow. Her ex is pretty much an ass. She stole her and her daughter's birth certificate and stolen my girlfriend's ID card. He also, used her SSN, we are trying to get social securities to change it, but they said they need concrete physical evidence. 

This is how it goes. My girlfriend currently lives with her parents. She does ALL the chores, cooking, cleaning, washing, etc and has to take care of her daughter. Everyone else pretty much works. There is one person who doesn't, but that isn't important right now. My girlfriend really does need a job. NOW a concern of mine is that I am afraid her pay check is going to all go straight to a baby sitter. The girl that doesn't work wants to be paid to watch her daughter and SHE lives in the same house. Personally, she is the type to want to get paid for doing nothing type of person. Don't get me wrong she is a sweet person, and trust worthy. Just wants to get paid for not doing much.

I am unsure what to do to help her out. She has tried making accessories here and there and does sell them, but it is not enough to really support her and her daughter as well as other expenses that will arise for her. There entire family is living paycheck-to-paycheck, my girlfriend also needs to use her WIC check to help feed the entire family as well, but most goes towards her daughter. 

Now me, I live 50 mins away. I help her out as much as possible. I pay a lot of attention to her daughter and she even loves the heck out of me, more than her biological father. She is always happy to see me and I am always happy to see them. I pay for everything we do and help her with some of the bills. I am a student, so I don't really mind for now. I got a part time job, which is simple and I get money for it. So, I help her out. The majority of the money is leftover money I have gotten from the government for school. I cannot keep doing this forever or else I will get into debt myself.

 I am unsure how to help her. She has no transportation herself, but I am sure she can ride the bus or walk, it is just if she does get a job I don't know who can watch the daughter. We were hoping when she does go to school, put her into some after school programs so her mother could work more and not pay anyone to watch her since most after school programs are free, but she is only 2. She won't be in school for a while. Being a college student myself, I am helping her daughter with the learning development her age demands and she is a bright little girl too. Talks, sings well and identifies a lot of objects for only being 2 and a half. 

Just, my girlfriend does need a job and quick. It really sucks her family makes her do all the chores, but she said she feels she doesn't contribute enough so she is willing to do them. At this pace she can't really get far with her life. She will be stuck there and I want to help her flourish into a better life. Any suggestions people. Many thanks.

151246,Relationships,1zc5un,"Before I get into any background, I should put out there that yes, I am aware that alot of HS relationships turn into shit.


Background: 

We've been together for almost 7 months, and we've known each other since middle school. It hits 7 in approx a week. He considers me the first girl hes ever really been ""in love with."" (Its only in quotes cause I honestly think love is really like personal opinion.) 
We don't go to the same school and see each other maybe twice a month, and its almost always with a group of friends, never alone. He and I skype every night though.
He and I are gamers (league and all that stuff) and MtG fans. I don't attend stuff like Friday Night Magic but he's invited me before/asked if its coolios for him to go that night and stuff.


What I think is the problem:

I always feel insanely uncomfortable when he asks if its okay for him to go to things like FNM. It just makes me feel on the spot and awkward saying no. He always feels bad if I just go ahead and say yes though, and half the time I end up doing so cause I feel like its not fair to him if I just say ""no I wanna spend my night talking to you and playing games"" or something along the lines of that.

A few weeks ago he went to FNM. It was a 3 day weekend, I didn't think much of it, and it didn't bother me. Cause we had Monday off he ended up asking me if he could go to Monday Night Magic too, and I went ahead and said yes because I felt like I didnt want him to have to miss out on anything. I really didn't want him to go. After that day I've felt a bit more upset whenever hes ended up going.

This weekend's like any other weekend, just Saturday and Sunday off. He went to FNM yesterday (Friday) with one of his closest guy friends and we'll call him A. Because he transferred out of A's school this school year, he hasn't been completely up to date on events and parties and stuff due to lack of invites and such.
A invited him to a party today (Saturday), and because it was with a lot of people he hasnt seen in a while I told him he could go when he asked. So he ended up being gone all day and stuff, and coming home around 11ish and barely mentioning stuff about the party. I just feel like I'm being super unreasonable about it because I wanted to kill Saturday with him.

So I have this friend... Nicky. Nicky[23f] and I hadn't spoken in about a year over small, petty drama, but I ended up running into her at my friend John's[21m] house about a month ago. Nicky and I ended up talking and agreed it was all water under the bridge, and reconciled our friendship. The party ends up moving to my house. Nicky, her husband Sam, John, me, my s/o and a few other people. 

We're all hanging out having a good time when people start heading on home. Included in these people was Sam. Nicky stayed, and she ended up getting pretty drunk. I went to bed with my s/o and the last I saw she was asleep in my guest bedroom. 

I wake up the next morning and everyone is gone expect John. He's pretty good friends with me and my boyfriend, so he told us what happened - he and Nicky slept together. According to him she initiated it and basically wouldn't let him leave until they had sex. Nicky told me later on as well, and that's pretty much exactly how it happened. 

One thing I want to make clear - I have no respect for cheaters. I think it's one of the most painful acts of deception you can do to a person. I saw my own mothers life torn upside down by my dad cheating, and I've been cheated on in the past as well. So this might be making my feelings towards this whole situation a little biased, maybe? 

Anyways, I basically ask Nicky wtf is going on, she never seemed like the cheating type to me. She tells me sex with Sam is nonexistent, he's cold, unaffectionate, not  romantic, ect ect. The thing is, Sam has always been like this. Since they first got together, they had a bad sex life (she vented to me about it a lot) and he never was the lovey-dovey type. She KNEW this, and married him (at to young of an age imo, but it's not my life) anyways. I still don't think her reasoning for cheating flys, because in the end there is no justifiable reason. If you're unhappy, breakup or work on it. Don't go outside your marriage. 

But, like I said, not my life. Well a few days go by and it turns out Nicky and John's one night stand has turned into a full blown affair. They both talked to me and my bf about it, and both of them don't seem ashamed, remorseful, nothing. It's like they're highschool kids who are tickled pink to be dating, or something. At this point I'm starting to get a little pissed that I let Nicky back into my life, and she involves me in this shit. 

John ends up telling us something else, apparently he isn't the first guy she's cheated with. Another mutual friend at the party noticed Nicky and John flirting, and basically said ""go for it man, she's easy, she's been giving me head for like 5 years now"". Fun story, Nicky and Sam have only been together five years. So if that guy wasn't lying, which I don't think he is, she's been cheating since the very beginning of her relationship. 

Why these two keep telling me and my bf all this is beyond me. At first we were both w/e about it, not our business, but the more they unload on us the more grossed out were both getting by it. Nicky has painted her self as an innocent victim her entire relationship with Sam, and tbh it made me never really like the poor guy, but now it turns out she's a pretty shitty s/o herself. Maybe that's why he never was affectionate, didn't like sex with her, because deep down he knew what she's doing behind his back? Idfk. 

The thing that tipped the iceberg for me happened just an hour or so ago. You see, Sam and John were pretty decent friends  before all this. After it happened, John basically said he couldn't be cool with Sam like that anymore, because it would way to ""wrong"" to hangout with him and smile to his face when he's banging his wife behind his back. Well, guess what? Nicky posted a picture on Twitter of all of them (her, Sam, John, and a couple other friends) all hanging out at her and Sams house. Really?! 

I know I might seem a little over-involved in this situation, and I guess I probably am. For one, Nicky and I have been friends for over ten years. She's always been the chubby, tall, and to be blunt, kinda ugly girl that never got attention. She met Sam and basically thought ""this is the best I can do"" and so she married him. I'm thinking she's having some weird, super early midlife crisis or something. Or she's finally getting the attention from guys she literally NEVER got at all growing up, and is going crazy with it. But, still, I can't sit by and be friends with her, or John, knowing what they're doing. Especially when they feel the need to tell me the gritty details. Especially when they're basically flaunting it in front of he husbands face like its some sort of game. And especially when I'm involved in this shit by knowing, and if shit hits the fan, my bf and I will be caught in the cross fire. 

So, what do I do?! I'm completely lost on how to handle this. And starting to feel guilty for sitting by and doing nothing.

I don't really know how things work here because I'm quite new in this subreddit. Anyway here it goes:

Backstory time! I used to date a lot of girls back when I was in junior year of my highschool (16y/o, don't hate mates) and it stuck onto me until I graduated highschool. Then I met this incredible girl that I met on my first year of college back in 2012. We fell for each other immediately. I told myself that the days of different girls every date is over, it's time for something serious, something that will last. The relationship was happy up until the ninth month when I did something really fucking idiotic. I went to a night out drinking with my buddies. Being the fuckturd I am before, I went home with another girl. She caught us doing it, like literally while doing it. She broke the relationship up and I begged her for forgiveness and for her to give me another chance. I did this for two months and one day she finally said that she forgives me and that I can have another chance to prove her that she's the only girl for me. It was clear to me that she will definitely change and I should have to accept it may it be good or bad, and from that day onwards I never did anything to upset her. Then another tragedy happened, I got debarred from our university. This said debarment made me move back to my home province to study. We are now having a 130km-long-distance-relationship. I know it's not that long but for college students like us it is hard. Those everyday dates and hangouts turned into twice in a month, but still I try my best to make her happy in those two days.

Fast forward to April 2014, she fell ill because of stress and sleep deprivation causing her to have considerable amounts of liquid in her lungs ( I don't know the medical term). I took care of her while she was in the hospital. Note that my birthday is on the nineteenth of April. On the day of my birthday she said something devastating to me. She said that she was growing tired of me. On my birthday! And while I was taking care of her! Obviously I was hurt. I asked her why and she responded that she didn't know why. I told her that I would do everything so she won't be feeling that way towards me anymore. By the time August hits and her classes just started (mine starts at June), I noticed something new. She has classmate of hers that she's often with. They always tweet to each other, the guy gives her chocolates and they go out often. When I asked her who that guy was she's just saying that he is just a close friend, that the chocolates are for their entire group and that when they go out it's always in groups. I believed her because I trust her.

Fast forward to November 2014. Our anniversary is on the tenth. I told her I couldn't come to her because that week was supposed to be our enrollment period for the next semester and being enrolled to a state university, it was always first come first served to get the good schedule. I promised her that I would make it up to her when I finished enrolling. And so it came to be, I went to her on the 25th of November. I surprised her in her college building with flowers. We went out for lunch and there she dropped a bomb that would shatter my world. She said that she want some time alone, that she wanted space for herself for awhile. I told her why she needed it? Asked her if I did something wrong? She didn't grace me with an answer and left me there in the restaurant, slowly breaking into tears. To make matters worse, just a week after a tumor was found growing in my left lung. The universe is sending me a giant fuck you in the face. Anyway, I gave her the time and space she asked for. I figured a month should be enough. It shouldn't take that long to figure out if you love a person or not. And so I asked her on the eve of Christmas, hopes up that she would take me back. Her reply was that she still loves me but there is something that is keeping us apart. I asked her what it is, and again the answer was she didn't knew what it is. And so I spent Christmas, with a potential lung cancer brewing and the love of my life so close to me yet so far off. I even contemplated to end it all just to save my family the trouble of financing the treatment of said tumor. I begged for her to take me back, told her that I would drop college and go work near her so we could be together. Still the answer is no.

Up until yesterday I realized what an idiot I am being. Running and chasing to something that doesn't want me in her life and doesn't deserve my love. But the funny thing is, however much I want to stop I can't seem to do it. So here comes where you, /r/relationships/, can help me.

Should I or should not continue chasing after her?

My gf happens to be one of the prettiest girls that I've ever talked to, and one of the most sociable/friendly that I've ever met. And I happen to be a shy, quiet, low self-esteem introvert.

41824,Dating,1srkma,"So a little back story. When I was a freshman in highschool I had a friend who was senior. He was nice guy and I kind of had that weird old brother type feeling for him. We shared a few classes and we always had a great time at school. Well, he graduated and started college, we added each other on facebook but never really talked outside that. Recently he's been hinted that he's like to take me out on a date sometime, which I would really like, but I'm afraid he wouldn't be able to see past our differences if he knew how different we really were.

Now, he really doesn't know much about my opinions on things because I'm a little quiet, he however is constantly posting his opinions on facebook, so I know them all too well.

I guess the biggest difference it religion. He's catholic and it's a huge part of his life. I've been an atheist since I was about 14. Now for me personally this isn't a huge deal. My last boyfriend was religious, and we simply avoided the subject, but I'm thinking that this guy is just a little too... uh... devoted to just brush it off.

He's also constantly going on about being pro life and anti gay marriage. He's started several 100+ comment flame wars by being so forward with his opinions. I'm very pro choice, and my believe that everyone deserves to be happy in regards to love. Again, not a big deal to me personally. You believe what you believe, and no one can chance that but you. Again though, he's not like that.

Other than that though we have a lot in common and both obviously are attracted to each other. I'm just wondering if you guys think it's worth it to try and start a relationship.

31365,Relationships,1sxay7,"This is my 3rd serious relationship (5 total, 2 for 2 years and 2 for a few months). We started as friends with benefits that lead to a relationship (friends is probably a stretch since we barely knew each other at the beginning). 


I honestly believe that this is my best boyfriend. First, to set the stage, I have always had an issue turning guys down (maybe because of confidence issues?) so I have always felt like I settled for guys. It sounds pretty terrible and arrogant to say, but the point I am trying to make is that my current boyfriend is someone who I REALLY wanted to be with. I find him very attractive both physically and emotionally. I frequently wonder how I got so lucky because I think he could find a much more attractive girl than myself. 


Like many relationships, things at the beginning were great. Recently, however things have been very rocky because of differences in our personality. His personality is very particular and polite. He holds himself to a high standard and expects the same from others. Because of this, he often gets angry or annoyed when people (aka me) don't meet his expectations.  


My personality is very laid back and carefree. I grew up as an only child with immigrant parents who didn't really emphasize being polite. I was explaining to my boyfriend that with people I'm close with I used to being comfortable without formalities such as saying thank you. 


Recently our fights have been because he feels like I am disrespectful towards him while I feel like I've done nothing wrong. The prime example that keeps happening over and over is him feeling like I am ignoring him. For instance this morning I was posting a picture of a friend on facebook and he asked me why I thought it was funny. I thought it was self explanatory because my friend was studying with a candy g-string on his book. So for some reason my brain just didn't process that I needed to say something in response and I just went on with what I was doing. I understand in retrospect why he would be frustrated with me, but at the time my brain literally just didn't process that I needed to answer him. 


If forgetting to answer his questions was a one time thing, I dont think it would be a big deal. The problem is that this happens all the time, multiple times a day, despite me wanting to improve and make things better. By the end of the day, my poor boyfriend has been trying to control his frustration and anger with me but he just gets more and more annoyed. He started telling me that I'm rude and selfish, which makes me defensive and ultimately I start fighting with him. 


So some context for the relationship. I would like to think that we both work very hard at this relationship. In the past few months I've made many changes to try to accommodate my boyfriend. Some examples include changing how I interact with other guys (I was a bit too promiscuous for his taste). I go to the hospital with him every 2 months for a medical condition he needs treatment for. He changed his diet to try to help with his condition and I took on the same diet as him. I also do things on a daily basis like cook him breakfast almost every time we spend the night together. I would like to think that I put in a lot of effort to make things work. My strengths are that I'm good at actively doing something. If I know I need to go to the hospital, pick up groceries for him, rub his back, I can do all of that. But I'm having problems making changes to things that I just instinctually do. I'm not sure how I undo a bad habit such as zoning someone out.


My boyfriend keeps telling me that I'm too selfish and just don't care enough about him anymore which is why I am ignoring him. He said this never used to happen when we first started dating. That I used to be so much more polite and respectful one month in. He thinks that I've gotten too comfortable. 


Let me know if you have any tips on how to break bad habits. Especially ones where you are unconsciously doing something. Also any strategies on how to avoid being comfortable?

63195,Relationships,39wkxl,"Hi, reddit. I'm looking for advice for a rather complex situation I recently found myself in. There are many aspects to it, so this post is probably going to be rather long. I need an insight from other people on whether to do something about it, and if the answer is YES, than what to do about it. 

**TLDR: my gf's friend is obsessed with her, after we started dating they stopped talking to each other, I suspect emotional abuse, and worst of all my gf wants to go to a movie festival with this friend.**

Let's start from how the situation began for me. I started dating my current girlfriend this March. A short while after we started dating, she told her group of friends about me. This is where all the shit and drama begun. It turns out one person from her group of friends was deeply 'in love' with her. However, 'in love' is not the best term to describe this, it might be more of a crush or an obsession. 

After she told her friend she was dating me, they went for a coffee to discuss it. As far as I know this friend was really, really close to my girlfriend for at leas two years. The friend confessed their feelings for my girlfriend in the café. I am 100 % sure my girlfriend has no romantic interest in this person, and she never has. But it did not stay at this. The friend also brought up 'evidence' that they actually were in a romantic relationship for the past two years. This evidence inclded numerous love letters the friend wrote to my girlfriend, but had never given them to her. Anoter point was a list of things they have done together that would only happen in a romantic relationship, such as frequent hugging, head on shoulder while sitting next to each other, sleeping in the same bed while on a sleepover etc... Now, after this, the friend started crying and my girlfriend just kinda sat there not knowing what to do - for several hours. This is how my girlfriend first described the situation to me. 

My girlfriend and I talked about this and I assured her that they'll both get over this soon and either resume their friendship or stop talking alltogether. The friend stopped talking to my girlfriend after that and started ignoring her. The problem is that they attend the same class and are in the same small group of very good friends. Thus as a result of this the group started falling apart. 

In the following months, there were only few occasions when the two would talk to each other. All of these involved lots and lots of tears from both sides. When talking to my girlfriend about this, new information came up. The friend was accusing my girlfriend for ruining their friendship and of using them just to fulfill her need of human contact and then dumping them when she started dating me. The friend also told my girlfriend they were crying because of this very often and that they suffered a lot. 

What I get from this is that the friend is placing themselves in the position of a victim. My girlfriend thinks that her friend is actually enjoying all the suffering and that he friend likes to be 'the victim'. This could be also supported by the messages my girlfriend showed me. Expressions like If only this was not so hard, If only I could feel nothing at all, That's easily said form your position etc... This makes me feel that the friend really wants to send a message about all the suffering and also a message that my girlfriend is the one at fault. And it seems to work pretty well, as my girlfriend often feels guilty (I tried to tell her otherwise, and luckily it quite worked). She also feels compassion with the suffering, but also anger that the friend seems to actually enjoy the suffering.

My girlfriend asked me not to get involved in the beginning, and I complied as I have never even talked to that friend, and the whole situation is none of my business. But during the three months we are together, I realized that this actually might be my business and that i maybe should get involved. I really hate when people are being dramatic, so on the one hand, I don't wnat to get involved in this drama. On the other hand, I don't really like that all this drama is happening around me, plus I care about my girlfriend and this situation is taking it's toll on her emotionally. 

This is the basis of my current situation. The problem that appeared is that my girlfriend believes that they can fix the friendship and that everything can be as it used to be before we started dating. However, for the three months, I did not find any change or improvement of the situation at all. Whenever they get to talk to each other, they both cry beacuse the friendship is ruined, and it still seems to me that the friend is trying to sow my girlfriend the hardships and suffering, while still hinting that they are both in different positions and that my girlfriend is at fault for this situation. It seems to me that the friend is trying to make my girlfriend feel bad, and that the friend has no interest in actually improving the situation anyhow. 

Now, the worst part and the thing that bothers me the most is that during the summer break, my girlfriend wants to go to a movie festival with this friend for 9 days. She says that it was a blast last year they attended. And that there are two possible scenarions: either the friendship will be fixed or something very bad will happen and she will get closure. This bothers me because there are not many occasions my girlfriend and I can see each other during the summer and this would be one of the few occasions gone. I am also worried that my girlfriend will be stuck in a remote place in a really uncomfortable situation for nine days. 

I feel that after three months of the situation not changing, I might want to intervene someow. Should I? What should I do? Just a side note, we talked about this, as this is the most common advice on this sub. I am asking what position should I take in this and how should I handle the situation. I am also afraid that I might be biased somehow and I need some stranger to call me out on this bias.


If you read all of this, thank you. Please suggest anything you think is the good course of action or say what YOU would do in my place. Thanks once again.

47080,Relationships,2ymrcg,"My friend (Drew) of about 4 or so years used to be awesome. Total social butterfly, probable sociopath, he was a guide to the majority of my social life. Many of the close friends I have today were developed with Drew's assistance. Drew loved to socialize, party, and meet new people - he is really talented at this. But throughout this he exhibited a lot of the qualities of being a sociopath,  for example: *Superficially charming, very rational, confident, unreliable, lied often, no guilt, etc.*
 But despite all this I valued him as a person and social asset. 

Everything changed when Drew found his girlfriend, (Mary). About 9 or 10 months ago he started dating Mary, after he hooked up with her a party but was already very interested in her. It seemed like they would be good together, but I didn't really have any idea. Gradually Drew became less and less of my friend, devoting the majority of his time to work and his girlfriend. 

Fast forward to now, Drew has been basically alienated. I'm really his only friend, and I barely ever talk to him anymore. He's said he's madly in love with his girlfriend, but I don't see it. Mary's nothing special at all, often I find her to be a really bizarre person in every way ... (she is somewhat delusional sometimes). Furthermore, Drew has dropped his aspirations in life. He intended to go to a state school, and major in a business area - he was very ambitious and he's actually a pretty smart guy. But now he has decided to go to a community college in the same town of his girlfriend, so he can be with Mary. He also decided to change his major. Everyone is really surprised by this, and he's truly embarrassed to tell people about it. 

What I'm getting at is, What should I do? I see Drew potentially throwing his life away, and it makes me sad. Friends have talked about an intervention.. (I cringe at that word but honestly it seems like not a bad idea). I just feel like I should do something about it, because he was one of my best friends ever.. so many good times with him (also a whole lot of bad). I could let Drew potentially throw his life away for a not-so-special girlfriend, or attempt to change his mind.

**Other key facts about him:**

- He pays for everything he and his girlfriend do.

- He has sad that he is only happy when he is with his girlfriend, and that he feels no urges to socialize outside of her.

- He has gone through two divorces of parents and neither of his parents are really there for him.

- He is very likely a sociopath.

- He and his girlfriend plan to get married, and have already looked at rings. *Reminder:* they are 18, seniors in HS

167101,Breakups,2c0iud,"We started off really intense, constantly texting and staying up all hours of the night to talk. We were best friends before we admitted our true feelings. This lasted until she started working two jobs to pay for school. She was putting in long days every day of the week and suddenly we weren't seeing each other or texting as much.

I haven't seen her since early June, actually, and I was lucky to get a few minutes' conversation in every week. And then last night I ask her why she doesn't seem too concerned about us not getting together much. And then she tells me she feels like we don't have a connection anymore, and that she has moved on, and that she realized she doesn't want to be with me.

I don't understand it. It's like it happened overnight. I agree that we lost our connection but I think it's because she's been working all the time and won't make time to see me or talk to me.

I'm so upset because she just dropped this on me and I feel like if she were willing to fight for it we could work this out, but she's not. I don't understand what happened at all.

I think I may have killed any chance at even a friendship by sending her a long, angry message on Facebook telling her exactly how I feel that she doesn't care about me and let our relationship deteriorate. I'm torn on the inside and I just want to know why she did this.

EDIT: I should own up to the fact that we'd hit a rough patch. I'm pretty upset by her unwillingness to open up her schedule for me and communicated such. This began a long argument about it and she told me she thought we should just be friends and take it from there. I asked why insistently, because this has been a stance we've taken before and it always led to us getting more involved, and she replied that she was fine not being in a relationship, that she liked the independence ""I guess"", ""I don't know what's gotten into me"", and finally told me that she thinks I'm not working hard for my future and she is tired of dating people who say they will change and never do and that she deserves someone who will.

I figured that was brought on by my complaining pretty consistently about work and life in general and giving sarcastic answers to her ""what do you want out of life"" questions. I've been a whiny bitch, yes, but in my defense I've been promoted at my workplace after not even a year and a half, I'm fast on track to buying a new  car, I'm already shopping around for a better job and I was talking with her about getting an apartment together eventually. It just feels like this is all coming out of left field and is so out of character for her.

31021,Relationships,23mjg3,"**Background:**  My mom and I have always had an interesting(on the verge of volatile) relationship, my dad [53M] and sister [30F] end up being the middle men the majority of the time.   
Back in January I ended a five and a half year relationship, which forced me to move back in with my parents, jobless, and with depression/anxiety issues.

**Problem:** Today I made the decision to start going to the gym.  I've been unhappy with my body for a while, and I forced myself to get up today and go work out.  I'm not overweight, but I'm squishy. Pretty much everyone that knows me is well aware of how I feel, especially my mom.

I went and worked out for a little over 20 minutes, while I realize this isn't long, I didn't want to overdo it on my first day, as I fully intend to make going to the gym a daily thing, and increasing my workout time the more I go.  


When I got home my mom yells from the living room short work out, or did you give up?  Completely flabbergasted by her insinuation that I would just give up  I said I'm not going to answer that, and went up to my room to change and gather laundry.  I texted my sister, as I usually do when I just need to vent, because she understands better than anyone.  And all she could really say was Oh my god, WTF? and that she was proud of me for going to the gym because she realizes how much it took for me just to leave the house, let alone go work out.


I continued on with my day, and about 4 hours later my mom asks if I'm having a bad day because I'm snippy.  As calmly as I could, I said My day is fine, but I'm a little hurt that you would think that I'd just give up rather than working out  She says she didn't think she said that, and then asked in different wording well did you work out, or was the gym gross?  Because you weren't gone very long. like somehow rewording the question, magically makes my feelings hurt less.  I said I didn't want to talk about it, and went up to my room, more hurt because not only did she NOT apologize when I said she hurt my feelings, but she just continued on with her 'I thought maybe you gave up' attitude.

She eventually apologized in the way that my mom usually does which is an I'm sorry followed by trying to justify that what she said wasn't as bad as I'm making it out to be.  I said I appreciated her apology, and that I still didn't want to talk about the gym.

I've pretty much accepted that this is the way that my mom is, anytime I've tried to do something positive with my life, she's been negative/unsupportive.  And I realize she's probably projecting her unhappiness with her own body on to me, I just don't know how I'm suppose to motivate myself when she's continually knocking me down.  It's not like avoiding or ignoring her is really an option at the moment.  Because on top of everything else, if I say I don't want to talk about it she'll continue to talk about it until I give up and give in.

26393,Non-Romantic,32wx87,"Sorry for the formatting its my first post. My boyfriend and his friends have a group text that they chat on all day. Today I saw a screen shot of my best friend's tweet and a load of mean comments from his friends about her. I had seen this about a year ago and got really mad, but my boyfriend asked me not to say anything so that it wouldn't cause problems. I had totally forgotten about it until I saw the tweet today and he admitted that it is a pretty frequent thing. I was upset because I thought we all got along great and were way too mature for this kind of stuff. My boyfriend doesn't contribute to the posts about her but instead is a bystander, which I let him know still upsets me a lot. The kicker is one of his friends in the group text is also my cousin who initiates most of the rude comments and posts. I asked my boyfriend to confront his friends but he thinks it's not big enough of a deal to cause problems with his friends over because his friends are constantly making fun of people in this way. The reason I was so angry was because the comments were very hurtful and a lot of them mentioned hating her in which my boyfriend said none of them have any valid reason to.  I asked if he would mind if I texted my cousin and politely asked him to delete my friend off of social media if she bothers him. Do you think I'm overreacting? I don't feel right staying quiet about this issue but I'd like some other opinions! Thanks!

I've know this girl, let's call her Alice, for just over 4 years and after about 6 months I started having feelings for her. About a year into knowing her, I realised that I didn't just have feelings for her, but I was falling in love for the first time. I went to a party with her on Halloween and we sat and talked (neither of us drank) about everything and I told her how I felt. She told me that she didn't feel the same and I was just crushed.


Fast forward another few weeks and I found out that she had just got in a relationship with another guy I knew who was in our college class. I didn't like him much, and I knew that he wasn't good for her, but I didn't tell her, as I felt it wasn't my place to poke my nose in, despite how I felt about her. 

6 months later and I moved away to attend university in a different city and I gradually began to, err, not forget about the feelings, but not be so all consumed by them that they didn't plague me every night and keep me awake. 

After first year of uni was done I moved back home for the break and I found out her boyfriend, the one I didn't like, had ended their relationship for no reason and had broken her heart. She called me up crying about it and I, being the dutiful person that I am, gave her my shoulder to cry on, and even went so far as to try and mend their relationship, because it was like a knife in my chest seeing her so upset. I wanted to rip the guys lungs out through his ears, and tell her how I felt, but I knew that it wasn't the time. I'm not sure if you guys have any idea how hard it is to comfort someone you love, be a shoulder to cry on after they get their heart broken by someone you knew was no good for them in the first place.

Fast forward another few months and she started asking me advice about other guys she was considering seeing, and as much as it twisted the knife in my chest, I gave her the best advice I could. Unfortunately, (or fortunately for me, idk) all of the guys ended up being some variant of her previous bf and she was able to see that after asking my advice. 

About 6 months ago we had a falling out, because I didn't know how to express my feelings about her, and I got frustrated and argued with her. We didn't speak for a few months after, but that knife in my chest just kept twisting. 

I apologised to her a few months ago and we've been working out way back to good friends, and I think we're almost there, but I still feel the same. Every time I see her, even when she's at work in her waitress uniform with her hair up, she takes my breath away. I can't take my eyes off of her and when I'm not with her or texting her or in contact with her, she floods my brain. 

I seriously do not know whether to tell her how I feel. When I told my dad about this, he told me I needed to show her I'm better than the last time, but I don't know how to do that. I mean, on the one hand, I don't know if I can live with myself if I don't at least tell her, and the result could be fantastic, and it would be the best thing to happen to me in my life. But on the other hand, I'm not sure I can risk losing a friendship or making it awkward, or even take the emotional pain of being rejected again (history of depression).

I want to tell her, I really do, but I can't seem to find the right moment or way. Every time I want to tell her, there's somebody else there, or something comes in the way. I don't even know what I'd say to her, or whether I'd just trip over my words and make a fool out of myself.

I think we would be great together and I feel like we have the basis for an amazing relationship (trust, shared interests, make each other laugh, enjoy each other's company), but I'm not sure that she sees the side of me that I want her to see. The side that shows her I'm honest, honourable, loyal, trustworthy, loving, caring, compassionate, intelligent (I hope), the list goes on.

I knew about her history with depression when we started dating. She was better and not on antidepressants anymore. She cried sometimes, but I figured it was her sensitive personality. Most of the time everything was good.


A few months ago her depression worsened and she started seeing a psychiatrist and taking meds again. I have been trying to help by being understanding and doing what I can, sometimes I'd go get some sun with her which is part of her treatment, or just talk.


Recently she started getting more irritable. Our sex life and communication suffered as a result. I told her it seemed she was avoiding me, and she told me it was because she was afraid to take it out on me. One night we went out and she did take it out on me. She was rude a couple of times and apologized at the end of our very awkward dinner.


If you want more details: the first occurrence, we were trying but couldn't get a taxi. She was trying to get one through a phone app while I tried calling, but neither of us could get one. There was traffic too so I suggested we walk and she said the app strangely found a taxi right as she cancelled, so I said to try again. She did and after a few seconds there was no taxi, I guessed it was an app bug and suggested again we walk. I noticed she was upset when we were walking and asked her if it was because we couldn't find a taxi, and she said in a rude tone that she was upset because I said one thing then another. I immediatly apologized because she was clearly very upset, but later said that I felt bad too because of her tone and wanted an apology as well. I don't remember if she apologized at this point, but I don't think so.


More details: The second one was during dinner. She needed a napkin and I got her one saying you're welcome. She gave me a hateful look and pointed out that she was chewing and couldn't have said thanks. I apologized and tried explaining it wasn't my intention to imply she was being rude by saying you're welcome before she said thanks. She angrily said that I always do that. I told her she was treating me poorly that day and pointed out the occurrences. She eventually apologized and cried a bit during dinner.


At home I said I wanted to discuss the relationship and she said she was feeling like shit and didn't want to talk. I went to sleep. The next day we talked and I told her I felt physycally and emotionally sick when she was rude to me. I told her that I noticed resentment when she said you always do that, which isn't true because most of the time I don't, and she said she only realized she resented me at that time and got mad. I said that's fine, but that she had to calmly talk to me about it instead of getting mad. We both apologized. I said I wouldn't do it again, and she said she had been feeling irritable and would try to get better and not take it out on me anymore.


Her psychiatrist suggested she might be bipolar. They're trying to get her medication right.


Today she was complaining about a blogger to me and said he was the type of guy who forcedly kisses girls or breaks their arms by pulling them when he gets rejected at parties. She read an excerpt of his post and his post was clearly dumb, he was complaining about being rejected but there was nothing about forced kisses or breaking arms. I tried to give my opinion that you can't categorize people in types and that, while his complaints were dumb, he didn't hurt anyone and so couldn't be accused of such, but she interrupted me saying that wasn't the point. I asked if I could finish and continued to explain my opinion, but she interrupted me again after a while. I told her she interrupted me again, finished my statement and left the room.


I came back a while later saying I wanted to talk and she apologized. I accepted and said we can disagree, but that we both have the right to be heard in a conversation. She agreed. I left again and when I came back after a while I asked if she was alright and she said no, she was sad. I asked her if she wanted to talk and she said no, and that she wanted to be alone. And so I'm writing this.


She's a great partner when she's healthy and happy. I really wish she would get better. She's taking her meds and going to the psychiatrist, but at the same time she feels very unmotivated, sometimes doesn't leave the house to get sun or at all, doesn't exercise, goes to sleep very late and wakes up in the middle of the afternoon. She doesn't really have hobbies or engages in interests other than internet/facebook.


I would feel like an asshole for not sticking together at such a hard time in her life. I know I would like my SO to stay by me if I was going through something rough like this. At the same time, this whole thing is taking its toll on me and our relationship isn't as good as it used to be. What should I do?


I might show her this topic and ask her if she wants to give you her perspective. Please let me know if that is a good or a bad idea. Thanks.

Around five months ago, she broke up with her boyfriend. Within days, she sent me a message and asked to meet up. We did, and ever since we've been meeting up every couple of weeks.

Our dates have always been incredibly stimulating and exciting. I've never made a physical move on her (she made it clear from the beginning that she didn't want this), but we've opened up to each other and spoken about everything, from our outlooks and expectations to our insecurities and vulnerabilities. She made it clear that she's not looking to 're-enter the game', so to speak, for at least six months (so one month left), as she wants space after having come out of her previous turbulent relationship. She also has a new job that she's very into. I made it clear that I understand her and am not looking to rush into anything either (we talked about how we both believe that relationships should be built on friendships).

I get it. I give her space. I initially dictated the tempo of the relationship, but once I began to understand her I let her take over (to an extent).

But still, I'm finding it very hard to understand her overall behaviour. Sometimes she's incredibly forthright and open; other times she suddenly pulls back and becomes very distant. For example, we went out last Tuesday and had an incredibly great time together, after which she immediately organised another date (dinner and theatre tonight). She text me for days after. But then suddenly nothing: radio silence. I sent her a brief text in the interim, and was confronted with a one word answer. Now, for tonight's date, she's again very distant and has cancelled our dinner plans in a very blunt manner, leaving only the theatre, which has hurt me and left me down regardless of her motives.

I guess what I'm trying to understand is how accommodating should I be to her? I want to give her space, and I have many things on my own plate to deal with, but I'm also finding it increasingly emotionally painful to deal with this back-and-forth. I've held myself back from becoming emotionally invested in her, but there's only so much I can do. Worst of all, I don't want to end up as a stepping stone for her to rebuild her confidence and make herself feel better, only for me to be left behind as she moves on with her life.

And what do I make of her 'timeline'? There's only one month left until she's 'back in the game'. But even that doesn't encourage me.

Are you able to give me any advice? I'll be meeting her later tonight. Many thanks reddit!

**tl;dr**: girl and I have a deep connection while she's still dating a guy. She breaks up with guy and initiates contact with me. We meet up regularly and have a great time together, building a deep emotional bond. But she says she doesn't want to rush into another relationship and acts unpredictably. I can't hang on for much longer, despite liking her a lot.",I [27 M] am finding it very hard to understand a girl [24 F],0.0,False,4.0,7.0,1440074092.0,/r/relationships/comments/3hpn79/i_27_m_am_finding_it_very_hard_to_understand_a/,Romantic
