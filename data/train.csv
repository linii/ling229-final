102,1uoe1e,"So I met this girl last Wednesday on New Years Day. We hit it off really well, we kiss at the end of the night, and I get her number. Before she left we plan a date for Friday. On Thursday we text sporadically throughout the day, as she works where she is driving around to a bunch of different places all day (she's a beer rep and account manager in my city, so she has to visit x amount of bars a day) Friday comes around and I take her out to a pretty nice place for dinner and afterwards we go and see a movie. At the movie, she puts the arm rest up and rests her legs on my lap, and eventually grabs my hand. She stays like this for pretty much the entire duration of the 3 hour movie, and I'm really enjoying her company.

I end up taking her home, we kiss again, and I head back to mine. I text her when I get home and said I enjoyed her company and thanks for going out, and she responds, I really enjoyed YOU! Thanks again for a fun night. I'm feeling great about it.

Saturday we text again sporadically throughout the day (it's usually from an hour to two between texts, sometimes it can be pretty quick though), and she had plans for a friend's birthday so I go out with my friends and do my thing, she does hers. That night while texting we make plans to hang out Sunday.

Sunday comes around and it got way too cold to do what we wanted, so she suggests going to a museum, but she had also invited her best friend. Whatever, that's fine with me. She changes her mind, she wants to go see a movie. I tell her that her and her friend can just go do their own thing and we can hang out some other time, to which she suggests we grab dinner that evening, and followed up by saying, I want to see you :). After the movie she calls me, and instead she wants to go to Dave and Busters, and I'm cool with that, and her friend is going and I also have no problem with that. We go and have a great time and all go to dinner after. When she leaves she tells me she wants to come over to her apartment the next night, Monday (last night) to watch the game. It would only be us.

The next day rolls around, and we text about the normal amount. I get off work and tell her to let me know when she's done so we can make plans, and she responds saying she got called for an event and wouldn't be able to do it (a beer rep gig at a bar), but she was so sorry and she would make it up to me. I tell her it's fine, work comes first, and we have plenty of time to hang out. That was the last I heard from her. I texted her later that night around midnight that I was going to bed and I hope work went well and good night. 

Today rolls around and I had not gotten a text, so around noon I text her and ask if she was still alive. She responded with a skull emoji only. I text her back and ask if she was busy and she said, Very so I text her back and say Mmkay, well I'll talk to you later then. to which she replies, Don't mmkay me! I just haven't been near my phone. I told her I didn't mean it in a bad way or whatever, I just didn't want to bother her when she was busy, and we can talk later. This was about 5 hours ago.

She's at another event right now, it started about 1.5 hours ago, but she hasn't texted me, however, she has posted a FB status about where she is (promoting) and an instagram pic. 

Am I just overreacting? We have exchanged maybe 5 text messages in the past 30ish hours. We haven't even been talking a week, but if this is how every week is going to be I don't know if I can handle it. I need someone who has SOME time for me during the week, I can't see developing a good relationship with such little communication. Should I wait it out, or tell her that I either need to get a little more attention or that it just isn't going to work? At what point is it too needy? I've been in a relationship before where the girl was too busy with work and it caused a lot of anxiety and stress and I ended up getting really hurt.


TL;DR: Been talking since last Wed. The past 2 days have had virtually no communication, at what point is it too needy to say I need more attention or that we should just discontinue?

Let me extra clarify: the issue isn't the not hanging out again, it's the fact that she can go all day without texting me. It's so early into it that I can't tell if she's trying to fade or genuinely busy all day long.","Me [23 M] with a girl I met on New Years [23F], is she interested?",0,False,6,14,1389147774,/r/relationships/comments/1uoe1e/me_23_m_with_a_girl_i_met_on_new_years_23f_is_she/,Romantic
133,31fntu,"Me [30s/M] with my sister [20s/F] who lives with me have been problems recently and I’m confused about whether I am being reasonable or overly controlling. 


A little back story first.  My sister, let’s call her Samantha, moved in with me 8 months ago, moving half way across the country to do so.  She was stuck in a deep hole in her old state.  She had developed a bit of a reputation in the area (unreliability – bucking authority figures), and could not find employment.  I believe she told me she has had 30+ jobs already, and she’s only in her early 20s.  She burned all her bridges and didn’t have any real friends left either.  She was depressed, miserable, and sharing an apartment with our father, and basically never leaving.


I do very for myself with work, which requires me to travel 3 to 4 days a week, sometimes an entire week at a time.  I had a spare bedroom in a beautiful apartment complex and the ability to give Samantha a new start at life.  The deal was that she could move in with me and start a new life, in a new state, where people didn’t know her and she could start over and build a better life for herself.  The terms were that she could stay in my spare bedroom rent free, but that she would have to start to make better decisions in her life and not get sucked back into the her old ways which did nothing but harm her.  She would have 3 months to find a job and if she found a job she could stay for up to a year.  There were other little considerate roommate arrangements that were made as well, such as no bringing people over when I’m out of town, and to help out with the cleaning around the apartment.


When she first moved in things were great.  I saw a very positive change in her demeanor and she generally seemed like she was becoming a happier person in general.  I was paying all the increases in utilities, paying for all our food, paying for all our entertainment (people do tend to get bored), and basically paying all expenses. In order to give her a fresh start I also paid off all her outstanding debts, roughly 1200 dollars.  Ultimately it ended up taking her 5 months to find a job, but because she seemed to be doing better, was keeping the apartment sparkling clean, and keeping good care of my cat while I was out of town I gave her the extra couple months to find a job.  We had a couple of hiccups during this first 5 months but nothing major.  She did bring a couple people over while I was out of town twice, and lied about it.


After she got her job (retail), everything seemed to change. She has dated 3 different guys in 3 months, and is currently dating her boss.  She has dated her bosses on two other occasions and as expected it has bit her before. Yet her she is repeating the same behavior that has bit her in the past.  When you are trying to give her advice she says that when someone tells her what she should be doing she wants to do the opposite.  She thinks of my opinions as being biased and that I’m an authority figure.


She is working 40 hours a week on a schedule that changes week to week.  My schedule is very random during the week but I am always home Friday night through Sunday.  Because of this it is hard to get our schedules to sync up to actually see each other and spend any time together.   Over the last 2 months she has been almost never here, going out over night and not coming home, effectively disappearing for up to 24 hours, not answering phone calls or texts. Every time this has happened I have had a discussion, pretty heated, where I explained to her that it is not acceptable behavior.  Yet, with each occurrence the amount of time she “goes off the radar” is longer and longer.  She apologizes each time, but will repeat the incidence about a week later. 


She will set plans with me, and then get off work and say she is going out, and not give me any warning that our plans had changed.  She will tentatively schedule some time with me, and then when something more interesting comes up she will change her plans and not tell me till she is about to walk out the door.  


This past weekend she comes home from work and as usual tells me that she is going out.  I say we had plans, you keep blowing me off and this time we had hard set plans, blowing me off again is very disrespectful.  She says she is sorry but she elects to go out anyway.  She is gone for 24 solid hours with no communication.  The first thing out of her mouth when she walked in the door was that she was sorry about the night before, that she knew she was fucking up things between us, but she had made other plans.  I said, if you knew you were screwing things up with me why did you do it?  She said because she was doing something that she finds fun, and that she knew I wouldn’t approve of what she was doing.  This is when I found out she has been dating her boss.


Fast forward to this past Thursday night.  She gets off at 8:30pm.  I happen to be in town.  I get a call at 11pm from Samantha asking me if she can bring “someone” home (She has to work at 6am the next morning).  I say that it’s a weeknight and that we both have to work in the morning, and asked her how long they would be here.  She said, an hour at most, and then they would leave.  I gave a dismissive, whatever, and hung up.  30 minutes later she walks in the door, drunk, with her boss and wakes me up.  I come out and introduce myself and make happy roommate for an hour and a half.  At this point it’s 1 am, and I politely dismiss myself and say I have to get some sleep and that she should probably get some sleep to (she would have to be up for work in 4 hours).


I go lay down, and I hear the TV turn off and see the lights go out. I notice that the front door didn’t get opened so I knew her boss was still here.  I got up to have a smoke on the patio and came back in and her door was closed.  I can hear sounds through her door and it’s obvious that something is going on.  At this point I’m seeing red, I spend the next 2 hours sending her txt messages that she is being disrespectful, that she is repeating her old ways, etc, etc.  2 hours later he leaves, and I go to tell her to read her text messages.  Neither one of us went to sleep that night.  We talked for the rest of the morning, once again, about how I found what has been going on unacceptable.  Once again I get empty apologies, and the explanation that she had given him a blowjob (In way more detail than I needed - she seemed to find it funny), and that was it.  She goes to work, and comes home and passes out a couple hours after getting home and sleeps a solid 13 hours till this morning.


I wake her up for work this morning and on her way out she says she has the next 3 days off, but that she is probably going out tonight and that I may not see her much the next 3 days.  She is never here, she isn’t cleaning the apartment anymore, and she quite honestly seems to be using me as a hotel where I pay all the bills, do all the cleaning, and support her.


I’m at a loss here, and I don’t know what to do.  I’ve talked with her about her behavior countless times and the only changes seem to be worse and worse.  She isn’t holding up her side of the original bargain and I just don’t know what to do anymore.  I desperately want to help her, and want her to build a successful happy life, but I see her life choices and disastrous and I’m not sure I can watch from the sidelines anymore. Am I being reasonable here that she should be a better roommate, actually contribute to the cleaning, spend some time here and not treat it like a hotel? Or am I being overly controlling and just let her continue what she has been doing?

1133,3hdjqv,"Title says it all. I work really long hours. Most of the time when I get off work I just want to go home, try to relax, and go to bed. I have maybe an hour or two free time on average on weeknights. My girlfriend calls every day when I get home and wants to talk for at least an hour which feels like it eats away at any personal time I have.

Don't get me wrong, I love her and I love talking to her...just in person. I do not make social phone calls literally ever. If I call someone it's because I have something relevant and time sensitive that can't be accomplished via text. I don't even call me parents to chat, but she's the type of person who has a list of people who she calls basically every day and chats with them for forever.

I'm not as social as she is. Every once in a while I like to have some time to myself to focus on my hobbies or read or play a game, but I can't do any of this while on the phone.

I asked him about it and he told me not to go through his phone. He got angry and I said he shouldn't be mad he's one with nudes on his phone. In all honesty he asked me not to go on his phone while I was doing it but I ignored him, that was clearly my mistake! After a few moments I asked if those pictures were hers (dead ex) and he said yes and asked me never to talk about the pictures or her again. I didn't know what to do or say! I was stuck because I can't say anything to hurt him but I'm not ok with that.. Maybe I shouldn't care about a few pictures but It makes me uncomfortable. I got tense and said we should drop our plans for the night because I didn't want to argue (our communication is so unconnected and I tend to give up in frustration) He left and now I'm sitting her wondering If this relationship is going to work. I feel like we would both be happier if we had different people. He needs someone who doesn't think too hard about things and situations, he needs a chill, cool girl and that's just not me.

A little  background. Last week on Tuesday I got a letter on the mail from DHEC (Department of Health and Environmental Control) that they need to speak to me immediately concerning my health! I called the persons number on the paper and she told me she couldn't talk about much over the phone, so we set up an appointment for the next morning. At this point after a little googling about the letter and the ladies name and job title, I figure it's over an STD. The next morning I meet with her and she tells me someone tested positive for HIV and that they gave my name as a sexual partner (she can't tell me when or who so no drama comes from it). She then takes my Blood to send off for a test and tells me that she will call me with the results which should be Monday. I've been thinking about who and when and there are only 2 people it could be from, from before i was dating my current girlfriend. I've also noticed other symptoms I've had that I didn't think to much of until now rash, fatigue, cough.

Now for the relationship part. I've been dating a girl for about 2 months. And things are amazing. We've had unprotected sex from start to finish 3 times (she has the arm implant birth control).

I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2upah7/im_in_love_with_a_girl_who_is_already_in_a/) here before, but I'll do a quick summary. 

I met this girl a work a little less than a year ago, and we shared the same shift all of spring and the majority of the summer. I wasn't expecting it at all, but after that first day of work I left thinking to myself, Wow I cannot like this girl. Too late. I knew it was too late then, but I tried to fight it anyway. I left that day telling myself that I couldn't like her because during one of our conversations about game of thrones, she slipped that she had a boyfriend. 

For a couple of weeks it was fine. She was just a really cool girl I worked with. But we got close over our shifts. Closer than average coworkers. Eventually, resentfully, I admitted to myself that I liked her. 

I didn't know what to do. Unfortunately for me i suffer from a disease. People like me are called romantics, and I found myself torn. Towards the end of the summer a more than slight wrinkle was added to the situation. Not only does she have a boyfriend, they have been dating for THREE years. That's huge. That's a huge feat that I think is rare for people, no matter the age. 

Here's this girl that I find amazing... One of those girls that makes you just say Holy shit. What kind of person meets someone who makes them feel that way and doesn't go for it? What kind of person actively tries to break up a committed  relationship? I wanted to be to former, but for that to happen, I would have to try to be the latter. Fuck. I can't be the latter, and I wouldn't want to be with someone who would want me after that. 

It took me a lot longer than I want to admit, but last night I decided to make a change. I had friends tell me that I shouldn't do anything, and just keep acting the same, and the only reply to my original post said the same thing. But I can't pretend to be her friend when I want something more. It might be not seem like a huge deal, but a couple months ago her boyfriend came in town for her birthday. While we all were at the bar, she asked me to take a picture of her with her boyfriend. She handed me the camera and I didn't reach for it. I kept my hands in my pocket and tried to politely shake me head. In the grand scheme of the night it wasn't a big deal at all. But in the moment, it was incredibly selfish. The worst part is that I don't feel particularly bad about it. It's just, how many hairline fractures can you take?

Last night I told her how I feel. Not how much, just that I like her and that I've felt this way for a while but that I couldn't keep pretending that I want to be just friends. I said that I think that she is great and I like talking to her and hanging out, but that if she wanted to cut contact, I was fine with it and understood for whatever reason. I then apologized for not saying anything earlier. 

I'm pretty sure she had figured out how I felt before I texted her, and I know that it should have been as personal exchange as possible, but it had gone on long enough. 

It hurts. I felt my heart breaking as I was typing, but I'm glad I did it. Before I met her I thought that I had killed the romantic in me. But she not only gave me that part of myself back, she also helped me define what exactly I want in a partner.

She called me the next day all upset and wanting to know what would happen with us if she started dating others. I said, I'd be out. I couldn't handle it.

called her 3 times and texted her, call me. I realized i looked nuts, then texted her back and said, haha sorry  i thought you drove by. Obviously that wasn't you trying to make it not obvious and continued by deleting her off facebook.

I wonder what I should do, we're suppose to hang out on Sunday.
I can have her come over and she'll never realize what hit her when I bring it up and tell her to leave me alone (almost doesn't seem worth it)

We've talked about marrying each other for at least 5 years now and 4 years ago I told him that I was definitely ready and that if he asked, I would say yes.  After waiting 2 years, I asked him to marry me and he said no because wanted to do it the right way with him asking me in a traditional way. I agreed because I thought it would be sooner rather than later. 

We went to a wedding this weekend and lots of people asked when it would *finally* be our turn and when we got home he was expressing how irritating it was keep getting asked that all night , and so I asked when exactly it would be our turn and somehow it turned into a really big fight and he left and brought back a ring and slammed it on our counter and asked if I was happy now and walked out, which I guess was his proposal (why fiancé was in the parenthesis). 

Then the next morning the ring was still on the counter and he said,  in an almost mocking tone,  why aren't you wearing the ring you've been waiting for 4 years for?  I told him that it didn't feel genuine and that it was actually pretty rude in my opinion (which is the truth) which started yet another argument and he took the ring back (another reason for the question mark) and told me that I would never be satisfied. So right now, I honestly don't know where we stand and I'm so frustrated and confused and kind of hurt.  Maybe this is minor, but with the way he's acting, it seems like he doesn't even want to marry me and I'm wondering if I want to marry him, but then again, maybe I'm overreacting.

So anyways, my dad married my step-mom, and we moved in with her and her son.  Everyone got along except for my dad and my step-brother, mainly because my step-brother, mainly because of my step-brother's rebellious streak (which ended when he went to college).  As horrible as this sounds, I know my dad still doesn't like him, and they don't interact very much.

My sister and step-brother seemed to click really fast and become good friends.  They both were on the track team, so I think they knew each other a little before we all officially met.

My sister and step-brother moved in together a year ago.  Recently, I went out to eat with my boyfriend at a nice restaurant, and I see them.  I'm not sure, but I really think they were holding hands until they noticed me, and we all ended up eating dinner together.  I didn't talk to my boyfriend about it, and when I got home I felt like I started piecing things together.  I now think they might have been together for a long time.  Here are a couple of reasons why I think I'm right.

1) Neither of them have introduced a S.O. since we moved in together.  My sister, who pretty much constantly had a boyfriend from 13-17, never brought a boy home.  My step-brother also never dated anyone and brought her to our family since the first  month we lived together.  Both of them are good looking, social, and friendly, so I don't think they would have had a lot of problems dating.

2) They would ALWAYS kick me out of her room when I was younger.  as a  12 year old it would get frustrating, they would just say they needed to talk about high school things and I would have to leave my sister's room.  They would lock the door and be in there for hours at a time.

3) No one ever said anything about it, but they were pretty physically affectionate.  I didn't think much of it, I just though they got along pretty well.  She would usually rest up against him if we were all on the couch or something.  She would even put her head on her shoulder.

4)  One time I think I might have walked in on them or something, I went to my step-brother's truck and they were in there.  They sprang up when they saw me.  They said they were looking for my step-brother's 10 dollar bill he dropped in his truck, and that I had scared them.

I really don't think I'm crazy.

I really feel the need to talk to them about it.  For some reason, I almost feel guilty, and I feel like that would help.  Should I?  And if I do, how should I approach it?

I broke up with him and stayed at a friends apartment for a month while I was trying to finish my midterms for grad school. I don't deal with stress well at all, and he and I both know this. I have some coping strategies, but when he and I are on the fence he doesn't respect them at all and wants me to put our relationship first above my degree.  
  
I have been thinking about things a lot, and I can't tell if I have just been annoyed and irritable or if I'm just simply not in love anymore. We don't really have much sex. I am on medication for a mental health disorder and it reduces my sex drive. His advice: you aren't even trying. Why don't you just try?

1146,2eyb1m,"I have been with my boyfriend for a little over a year. We just moved in together this summer. Our relationship is fantastic: we get along wonderfully, virtually never fight, have hobbies/interests in common, and have plenty of frequent and awesome sex. I am super happy about being with him. 

He's also a joy to live with. We have a great split... he does dishes and trash; I do laundry and cook (I went to culinary school way back when, so when I say cook, I mean COOK)

My major concern is about his lack of motivation, and it really boils down to a few problems:

-his job pays NOTHING... like, roughly $1,000/month. 
We split the rent 70/30, then I pay utilities, buy groceries, and have been buying furniture/decor for our new place. Not to be selfish, but if he could just earn a little more, I'd be able to spend my money on my student loans, travel, etc. I'm a small business owner and every dollar comes from working extra hard... if I worked as little as he did, I'd earn that little, too. I don't need him to earn what I earn (I realize I'm extra lucky to love my job so much), but an extra $1,000/month would be such an amazing contribution to our household and make me feel so much less burdened. 

-he has done NOTHING to change this.
I don't need or expect him to become a CEO or a brain surgeon... I'd even accept his terrible income if he was doing something he loved, but he works at a low end restaurant chain. He hasn't so much as skimmed job listings since we've been together, despite complaining about his terrible job many times a week.  I don't care if he wants to go back to school to work towards a career or whatever, but jeez at least move towards something. 
This was really exposed last week, when one of my regular customers mentioned she needed a line cook for the restaurant she manages and asked if BF was available (she has met him many times) He would be able to do the same chill, low effort work with better hours, better perks (take home food would actually be yummy and versatile, not just burgers), actually getting tipped out, great location from our place... I even mathed it and he'd be earning $2,100/month, which is over DOUBLE what he's currently earning for the exact same type of low commitment job... he told me to tell her that he wasn't even interested in going to an interview... WHAT??? You just... want to keep enjoying my money instead?

-he does NOT contribute extra to make up for earning less
He does stay on top of the dishes, which I super appreciate (sponges gross me out), but that is part of our chore split, not above and beyond.
At my business, I pay a handyman $20/hour under the table to change lightbulbs etc. and have mentioned that I'd rather just give the money to BF, but he's not interested in that, either. If he wanted to putz around my store for a few hours a week, I could just pay him or at least feel like he was contributing to my ability to earn. 

-is MY motivation going to suffer?
I'm an ENFP, which means I really pick up on other peoples' vibes. I expanded my business and hired a few new employees before we moved in together, but I have cut my hours back and done less above and beyond future planning than I used to when I was single. 

I still have a goal of expanding to a much larger space with 20 employees instead of 5.. 

I've also gained a good 10lbs, which isn't the end of the world, but if it turned into 10lbs a year...


Obviously, BF and I have discussed this, but I don't think he realizes how strongly I feel. When we met, he was 22 and new to town, so a throwaway job made perfect sense. It never even occurred to me that he might just stay there for no reason when people literally straight up offer him something better. All his friends have normal careers, so I'm just at a loss. 

I would have to consider this a dealbreaker if he is never going to do anything, which sucks because everything else is so wonderful. I'm not an ultimatum girl, though, and I don't know how to tactfully and respectfully admit how awful this is for me without crushing his cute little feelings. Just imagining how his face would crumble makes me want to cry.

372,369q0u,"My girlfriend of 2 years who I love dearly was recently diagnosed with complex PTSD or C-PTSD, which some people call the worst form of PTSD. I took a course on mental health/etc before and I asked her to see her doctor because of some of the symptoms she was showing and he diagnosed her with C-PTSD (she is also seeing a therapist now). It's really hard on our relationship but I love her dearly and want to make it work, but I haven't been truly happy in a while. First, let me tell you the story:


My girlfriend grew up mostly with her mother &amp; stepdad in a house with many siblings, 2 biological, 3 step siblings, and many foster siblings (her mother uses the foster kids as income, it's horrible). The biological &amp; step kids were neglected for the foster kids since the parents needed the income from housing them (that's how the system works around here -.-). My gf was put in grown-up positions too early like doing all the housework, babysitting instead of having time with friends or to do homework, etc. 


She started dating this guy when she was 14, partly for attention from her mother who was hugely against it. Btw she already had mild anxiety at this point. Then a year later he rapes her, tells her that if she tells anyone he'll ruin her life, and becomes really controlling and she stays with him for years. He raped/hit/verbally abused her regularly for years and her mother just called her a hormonal bitch when she was acting up, but in reality she was depressed/anxious and having suicidal thoughts.


He eventually cheated on her and dumped her. A while later I met her and eventually we started dating seriously and she told me what had happened to her. We live together now and we both work full-time. 


Her doctor sent her to the best PTSD counsellor in our area and she said she could tell almost right away after a brief chat (without my gf even telling her what happened, because that might trigger her) that her ptsd was severe. I looked up the symptoms myself too and she has pretty much all of them: inability to trust anyone, flashbacks, nightmares, constant racing thoughts, depression, anxiety, jumpiness, trouble sitting still, extreme mood swings and bursts of anger, violence (she has hit me during her triggers when she has a flashback and thinks I am her ex), low self-esteem, fear of sexuality, trouble paying attention, fear of crowds/people, and also she is very intelligent and is quite a linguist but has trouble reading now since her mind literally can't focus long enough on the words on the page. She doesn't want to take any meds, which I can understand in some cases since North America is definitely over-medicated imo but I think meds might help her a bit. 


Also another symptom is trouble maintaining friendships/relationships/family ties because she is afraid of being hurt and also has severe mood swings. As a result she doesn't really have any close friends so we tend to stay at home together but that also means I don't get to see my friends either and I'm afraid I will lose them soon. She has also become controlling. She doesn't want me on Facebook/text unless she's there with me, won't let me hang out with friends by myself, and she can't be left home alone for long because if she has a trigger there is nothing to take her mind off it and she will blow up on me when I get home. Also I can't watch TV with females in the show/movie because she will think I'm checking them out. I have to look away both on TV and in real life and I disagree with this but she rages if I bring it up. 


I know it sounds crazy but even though she calls me names/yells/sometimes hits me when she has a trigger, if any of you know someone who has ptsd or have ever seen a trigger then you might know that they don't mean to intentionally hurt people. She is COMPLETELY different when it acts up.


There is so much more I could write but it's already really long and rant-y, but basically I love her and care about her but both our lives are kind of hell-ish a lot of the time. She really is a sweet girl when she's having a good day; she's thoughtful, kind, honest, smart, funny, loves animals, works hard. She always apologizes when she calls me names/hits me. I have a lot of anger toward her ex because he basically ruined her life forever and got away with it. Is it unfair to not be with someone because of their mental illness? What can I do? :(

Is there some kind of monogamy gene that is missing? 

To give you a bit of background, the first time I cheated was when I was around 14 or 15, I guess that would be my first proper relationship. The cheating involved texting other boys, and then kissing someone as well. Between then and now, I have been in numerous other relationships, only one in which I didn't physically cheat, however I still found myself lusting over other people, or just wondering what it would be like to be with other people. 

I am fairly attractive, intelligent, successful, and I don't think I really have any reason to have low self esteem, so I don't think it can be linked to that (obviously like everyone else I have my moments where I'm not 100% happy with myself.)

I am currently in an 18 month relationship with a 22-year-old male, and around six months ago I cheated on him with an ex partner.

I know that you will want to tell me that I should tell him and break up with him, but he has issues of his own and I really believe (and he has told me so himself) that I have helped him to become a better person and I am scared that the truth would absolutely break him, so to me it feels more selfish to be honest than it would be to hide this from him. I don't want to cheat on him again, but I am terrified that I will.

The last 18 months have been on and off 'pseudo' long distance (I say that, as she is just a city away for school, so weekend visits were quite frequent). We called each other on Skype pretty much everyday, even if it was just to talk for a few minutes before we went to bed. 

  At some point the relationship sort of got stale, as we both started taking each other for granted. It was her Idea for the break, and to be honest I wasn't really fond of the idea, but I couldn't say no. So we decided that wed reconnect in exactly one month if she was ready. Nearing the end of that month she texted me letting me know that she wasn't ready just yet, and I responded telling her that it was no problem, and to just take her time. Another month goes by and here we are today. We didn't specify that we would reconnect after X amount of time, just that shed get back to me when she is ready, which still has yet to happen

   Thats sort of the backstory, so here is what Im struggling with:
As I am getting farther into the break, I feel like all I can think about is all of the negative stuff that drove me nuts when we were together. There wasn't anything that was a relationship deal breaker, just little stuff, which required lots of my energy to put up with. Things like reassuring her about her body image, or making sure she was proactive about her health (such as her shitty immune system, and really really painful periods. It seems like when ever she didn't have cramps that made her faint from the pain, she would be hacking up a lung. Ofcourse all of this made her extremely tough/strong [read stubborn])

   I loved her through all this, and would gladly put up with all of it if/when we get back together, because there is a way that she just pours happiness into my life. But currently I am struggling to keep those good memories from getting buried by the little annoying things that I know I will have to embrace when we get back together.
 
   What makes it worse is that there is a girl in my work place I sort of have a crush on, and I think she likes me too. Thankfully she doesn't work in my department, so I can't really act on any temptations, (its also worth noting that I would never cheat on my current GF, but this other girl makes me feel like I should get out of it and make my life simpler)

Regardless I know this all sort of a ramble, Venting is also nice, and if any of you have advice, Ill take it with a grain of salt.

Cheers!

  

   
**tl;dr**: After SO initiated a break with the intentions of getting back together, part of me wants to jump ship, but the other half of me loves her to the bone and never wants to let her go.","Me [19 M] with my GF [19 F] 2 1/2 years, currently on a 'good break' and I think its making things worse?",0,False,1,4,1428967908,/r/relationships/comments/32i1um/me_19_m_with_my_gf_19_f_2_12_years_currently_on_a/,Romantic
889,3h0aw2,"I've known my bio dad since I was 16. I love him and his wife, but they're terrible with money. I lived with them for a while, and my dad asked me if I wanted to open a joint account with him, so that he could transfer money to me easily. Shortly after I got a job. My dad had a decent paying job himself, but he has a lot of loans and basically every time I got my paycheck, my dad/his wife saw it and asked me to 'borrow' most of it. I didn't see much of that money back.

The situation now: I am married and my husband makes all the money, since I quit my job a few weeks back. I went to visit my parents across country, and brought the 400 dollars that I had left from my paycheck with me. I rarely put anything into the account that my dad and I share, because that money would disappear even after I left home. I brought my money with me in cash (I had troubles with my personal account). 

My dad picked me up from the air port and immediately asked for gas money. As soon as he did that, I had a hunch that I was going to be buying groceries and gas for the duration of my visit. After a few days my dad asked me how much money I had with me. I told him that I had 400 dollars, and that I didn't mind paying for groceries or gas for them, as long as we made sure that I had 50 bucks left to check in my suitecases at the airport.

An hour after that discussion my dad came to me and asked 'so, can you give me the 400 dollars that you were going to loan me?'. I didn't know that he wanted me to just give him the cash, I thought I'd just agreed to pay for necessities. I just complied and went to get the money. My dad berated me for not putting it in our joint account but carrying it with me in cash which kind of pissed me off. Because the reason that I don't put anything into that account is that he and his wife take it without asking.

During the vacation my dad also keeps advising me about money and telling me what my husband and I should and shouldn't buy. 

A few days later my dad told me to ask my husband to transfer me money for my suitcase. My dad had spent almost all my money. I got kind of aggravated but asked my husband to transfer about 300 bucks so that I could leave my parents some cash when I left, since they have nothing. 

The money transfer is taking a bit longer than expected and today my dad told me that if the money doesn't come in he won't even have enough to bring me to the airport!

My problem is basically that my parents aren't upfront at all. They don't come to us and ask for money, they wait till they literally have NOTHING and then ask for a 'loan' on a really short notice, or they just take it from the shared account (whenever I put something in there). 

They could've given me a head's up before my trip. They could've told me that they had no money and then I would've brought more money with me.

It also bothers me that they keep telling me that they're gonna pay me back. They're my parents. My husband and I agree that we need to help out our families financially and I'd gladly just pay for stuff/give them what I can. I don't need it back, but they need to tell me in advance. 

I also really want my dad to stop telling me what I should and shouldn't buy. 

Am I right to be upset with my parents? Why do they do this? 

TL;DR = parents are bad with money. I'm sick of them not telling me when they need cash but instead just taking it/asking for it on a short notice leaving me with nothing.

He sat me down and told me it was over and that he didn't love me anymore. He also mentioned that he hasn't loved me for quite some time. He explained that I'm holding him back and that he wants to move further away for work. I work for his family and go to school where we live . I moved an hour from home so that we could live together because it was convenient for school and obviously we wanted to live together at the time. He says there is nothing wrong with me and that its just because he's comfortable with me, and that he doesn't love me anymore. His family is upset and we all had no clue that this was coming.

1168,2buajj,"So, long story short - I used to be the awkward, socially shy kid, and I never dated or even kissed a girl. After improving myself over the past couple years, I started seeing/dating a girl a couple months back. We are also both virgins.

She says she likes me because I'm funny, handsome, and smart. I honestly think I only like her because she's attractive. Although she has does have redeeming qualities, I find her lazy, careless, and unambitious - qualities which I wouldn't prefer in a long-term mate. 

That being said, I am completely inexperienced. I don't understand this full *relationship* thing. How does all this work? Don't many people get into relationships simply because they find their SO attractive/just a companion to spend time with? Or do people generally get into relationships expecting that whoever they are dating is going to be their long term mate? 

These issues have been built up internally inside me once we tried -and unsuccessfully- have sex (her idea, not mine). I'm worried that eventually after I take her virginity and we have casual sex more often, she will become really emotionally attached to me when at the moment, I feel like at times I'm more in a FWB mental state. In other words, I don't want her to think I am *using* her but I feel like at times, I am.

I haven't tried talking to her because I'm afraid it will affect our relationship unnecessarily as I am unsure of how I am even supposed to be feeling. Am I overreacting? Should I just continue as how it is and see where it goes from there (let this relationship grow)? Should I end this right now? Or simply ask her how she feels in all this?

928,2ffxmv,"i'll keep it short and sweet. We met around 4 years ago and didn't like each other to start with but over time we grew close and ended up going out.

The first year together was amazing, it was like i'd found my soul mate the sex was good and things were ticking over nicely.

Then my career changed and i went to study, i met new people and was enjoying it. One of the new people i met was a girl and we became friendly. I had a soft spot for her but nothing happened, my GF looked through my laptop though and found conversations between us. (Nothing was ever said that was inappropriate between us but i suppose there were undertones that i liked her) In her eyes i had cheated on her. I ended up leaving my studies shortly after for a multitude of reasons 

Things became stressful in life shortly after that, i was ill and started suffering depression i could function go to work etc but i was down a lot of the time. 

Fast forward the last 2 years and the intimacy between us has slowly slipped away, our sex life has become virtually nothing and although we talk about and agree about it i just don't seem to have the urge to sleep with her and my libido generally is virtually nothing due to being down. I love her so much and i want to be better for her but i dont know if my depression has made me want to be alone or the spark has gone.

My sister and I are very close and she has become good friends with my girlfriend, so we all spend a good amount of time together. I've always held a great deal of respect for my sister because she is a very hard worker and a good person morally. 

But lately things have changed. 

The last party my girlfriend threw, my sister drank too much and lost all of her inhibitions. She was walking around to almost every guy at the party, putting her hand on their crotch and coming on to them in front of me, making for an awkward situation for both me and the other guys, knowing she is my sister. Eventually she ran off with a guy and did the deed, while every other person at the party talked about how slutty she had been acting. 

In the morning she said she didn't remember any of it and acted as if she was filled with regret and said it would never happen again. I assumed that she was telling the truth and that my good little sister had just made a big mistake. 

About a week after this, I left my hometown for college a few states away. I'm still dating my girlfriend, and since I left, I've heard that things like this have been happening again, and that my sister is out of control. She's been getting drunk on school nights (she's in high school), hooking up with more random guys, driving drunk, and drinking to the point of blackout frequently. I don't know how to handle this. Me and my sister's relationship with our dad is not a good one; his punishment for this would hurt her more than it would help her. Our mom isn't a part of our life. My sister used to have her shit together but now all i can think is that she has completely derailed. 

Reddit, how can I get through to her and make her realize that she isn't just 'having fun,' but that she could be potentially harming herself and living a destructive lifestyle. Any advice would be very much appreciated.

440,1j4kgl,"Kind of long story, but here goes. I met my then boyfriend's (we're recently married) friend, let's call her Karen, about seven years ago. She lived one state over, less than a day's drive. She and I hit it off right away and before long, anytime she was coming to town to visit she was making arrangements with me instead of him and almost always stayed with us. I had even visited her and her hubby on my own when I needed a vacation before having a mid semester melt down while in school. She is very much a free spirit and I appreciated her wilder, impulsive side to balance my planned and structured nature. That was when we were still in our twenties...
I call her a collector of strays. She seems to attract people who are down and out, need a boost, a lift, a place to crash. Good on her for being there for those people. But those people often carry drama with them, something I abhor. One night, when she was visiting with us, one of those strays was in need so she told random dude I've never met to just come over to our house and stay on our couch for a few days until he got his situation sorted. Um, ok? My husband is so easy going he just went with it. I allowed that I was probably being OCD about my home and decided to let it go. I was raised to help those in need, but I kind of draw the line at inviting complete strangers to spend the night on my couch. Especially when I know they are bringing drama. I basically found a way to avoid my house while that guy was there. 
Another time, she was visiting a friend and asked if we could all meet up. Get friends was a girl I had never met, and we all met up a a bar close to my home. I was watching this girl and her behaviors seemed kind of off. But again, I felt like I was being critical so tried to let it go. But she was saying some weird shit, going on and on about some person she met that was going to change her life, random stuff she kept repeating. Changing the subject, often. We go back to my house since we had a hot tub and us girls all hopped in. After a bit I excused myself since I had to work the next morning. And we could hear the two girls still up, trying not to be noisy. The next morning Karen's friend was gone, one of our bath towels was missing, along with a meditations book we kept in the bathroom. Find out later that she was on some serious meds that she decided to go off of earlier that week, packed up and left our house making a hobo bag out of the towel and a pole from our yard, hopped our backyard fence and ended up in a motel in a rough neighborhood with no money, no car, no phone. The rest of that story is irrelevant unless you count her bf showing up at our house looking for her. 
Anyhow, these are the people she surrounds herself with and I guess helping them makes her happy. But don't bring crazy or drama IN MY HOUSE. 
She recently went through a really rough divorce. Her side was that her husband was insane and basically lied to her and everyone they knew about everything. He wedged himself between her and some of her strays, making up stories that she couldn't believe were true but did because why would her hubby lie? She decides to move back to her other home state after they split, and apparently had a few revenge fucks along her cross country road trip. A week before my bachelorette party, I get a call from her that she won't be able to make the party that had been planned for six months. Tells me it's because she got knocked up on her road trip and doesn't know who the father is. 
So, I offer as much support and advice and I can give. Let her know that the universe probably had some sort of plan for her and perhaps it was time she started to grow up and stop living like a gypsy. Maybe she was being offered something else to live for. Karen said to me I'm not livin' for this kid. I've got an appointment with a vacuum in two days. Thankfully this conversation was over the phone otherwise I may have stabbed her in the eyeball.
DISCLAIMER: I am pro-choice. I believe that a woman has a right to decide if she wants to have a baby. That being said, I DO NOT condone abortion as a resolution to lack of birth control and being stupid with your body. I am not trying to be judgemental, but by the time you are thirty, you know how babies are made and you know what to do to prevent conception. So... maybe don't be a fucking idiot and get yourself knocked up while you are still married to your army husband and angry banging each friend who offered you a place to crash on your drive across country? 
Anyhow, I was feeling done with her because I no longer felt we were on the same wave. I also feel like she may have sensed it since the day before my wedding, she was texting my husband, not me, if she could bring an extra guest to the wedding that neither of us were friends with. I just looked at my husband, and he immediately texted her No.
So...between her bringing crazy and drama into my home, having zero regard for manners and propriety overall (husband excused her behaviors as being common in the town they are from. Wtf?), then the abortion thing... I'm really not feeling having dinner with her tonight. In fact, she has resorted back to texting my husband to make visit arrangements. Guessing she is intuitive enough to figure out I'm kind of displeased. Am I being crazy, need to get over it and let others live whatever crazy life they choose and force myself to be ok with it or do I have valid reason to want to distance myself from her? Help!

I have a few people i consider best friends, and those relationships don't look anything like this. she doesn't have any best friends from back home where she's from (we're both in our current area for college), which to me, is a red flag. there's a possibility she might have actual feelings towards me because she has dropped some clues that tell me she might be bisexual, and also makes this ongoing joke in front of coworkers that we are lovers.. shes wanted to cuddle.. I don't even feel comfortable giving her hugs anymore!

Let me preface this by saying that my mother is one of my biggest inspirations for hard work, which is why I feel so crappy about being a non-traditional son. She was always the tent pole that kept the family financially sound, while my father was just an average guy who didn't want anything extravagant in life and was able to live with the bare minimum (Not that I minded really). We moved to Canada from China when I was 8 because my father wanted a shift in career and my mother gave up her then booming career as a respected VP of a national company. Things were rocky during my teen years as their relationship deteriorated, with him not finding a proper career in Canada and her wanting to work in America. Thus, they divorced and she took me along to LA when I was 14. 

I've spent my high school and college years here and grew up with western ideologies and values. During my college years, she went back to China to work to run her own company and do consulting work. I lived alone, renting a room, for the last 4-5 years and have grown accustom to that lifestyle. I found a great job after I graduated in which I made enough to finance a car. 

My mum planned to retire this year so last summer, she put a down payment on a place here (we live near my aunt and cousin) and told me to pay mortgage as the house will be in both our names. I didn't think about it too much and went along with it. This leads me to this year, when she moved back. It's not that its inconvenient having her around, but I just can't shake the feeling that I shouldn't be living under a roof with a parent at this age. I lived fine all these years on my own, but I feel bad for having these thoughts, as in traditional Asian families, kids tend to stick with parents until marriage. I'm not into that though - I'm often jealous of my friends who moved and started a life in another state without having to worry about their parents. I would gladly move out and assist her with the mortgage payments, but that's not so financially possible at the moment. 

I worry about her future for when I'm not around, and often tell her to go find a boyfriend/new husband, but she doesn't seem to be putting in too much effort. I forgot to mention that her last one was a complete alcoholic man-child, which leads me to wonder if she is still holding back from meeting folks. 

I've recently mentioned moving to the east coast for grad school.. But in my head, part of the reason I think is the need to leave home. She said that she wants to keep the house and wait for me to graduate to be back. I'm 200% sure if I do come back after grad school, I wouldn't be living with her then. I don't want her to feel neglected and alone though.
 
I know she's taken care of me, I love her and all, and that I do sound like a selfish prick here. I also don't know if I have a question really. Am I a huge shitty person for feeling like this? I guess the general, want to leave home, be free, and be away from family?

She has been kicked out of her parents house three times I know of. Her friends always seem to take her in after she changes her ways, only to allow more drama and her to move around amongst them, only to return home and start the cycle again.

901,3hupws,"In February of this year, a close friend of mine who I met at uni 18 months previous ended things with her partner of 3 years. A couple of days before completely ending it (they’d been heavily discussing it for a couple of weeks) she text me whilst she knew I was out drinking asking if I’d be up for a friends-with-benefits situation, as we were both leaving university in June and so not really interested in starting anything long-term with anyone else for a while.

I’d always had a thing for her, and I find her incredibly attractive, so naturally I said yes, and until early June (when we left) we had the best sex of my life. I’ve had a few partners before, but none had been quite like her, and she felt the same way (or so she told me). We’d agreed at the beginning and also at this point of time, that things would go back to being just friends at this stage, as we were moving to different parts of the country, and we wanted to be able to remain close.

Fast forward to around a month and a half later (mid-July) and we’re scheduled to meet with a group of our mutual friends at a friend’s house for a weekend, to socialise and spend some quality time with our close friendship group. Prior to this, my fwb partner said to me that she wanted to have sex together once more whilst we were visiting. She said that she missed the sex between us as well as the intimacy and that she wanted to experience it one last time. 

I had been struggling since things had ended between us with my emotions. I missed the intimacy an awful lot also, and whilst we’d both previously said that a relationship between us wouldn’t work, it was all that I wanted. I decided I would sleep with her that weekend, because, well its sex, and great sex at that!

2 weeks after this, she requested (whilst she knew I was drunk) that I visited her at her new place for a few nights soon as she was desperate for sex and the intimacy once more. This happened last weekend, and once again the sex was great. We were more intimate than we ever have been before, and once again, we both said it would be ending soon when I left, although since she’s been talking about me visiting her again, and her visiting me in my new place.

The signs say to me, that she’s quite into me, especially the sex, but at the same time she always talks about these ‘hot guys’ or ‘hot colleagues’ that she knows who maybe she could start dating, and this last weekend came out with something along the lines of “I’d love to be able to start a relationship with you, as you’d be the best boyfriend, but I don’t think I’d be able to see you that way”. Then at the same time, when we went shopping together last weekend, she spent the whole time wanting to walk hand in hand, and hug etc. in public, constantly saying she’s desperate for a boyfriend. Basically, she’s confusing as fuck!

Now its our friends Birthday party tomorrow, and we will both be seeing each other there, and will get plenty of opportunities to spend one-on-one time together if we so desire. Sure enough, she’s suggested having sex again, but it could be the last time I see her for some time, and I don’t know whether I should just express my feelings towards her, or just have sex and let things carry on as they have been.

1158,2qtii0,"We met in college and hooked up, but never dated. We re-kindled a long distance relationship via trips back to my college town, and she eventually moved to my city and straight into my home. this is about 1.5 years into the relationship.

Because she had no money, job, or parental support, I gave her a credit card and basically let her spend my money as if it was hers. It quickly became obvious she is a shopping addict, and I allowed it for awhile (4 years), but now I'm out of money. I haven't allowed us to go into debt, so its not a dire situation. However, I've had to take away the card and that has been a huge strain lately because she has very little money while I have a lot. I dont buy things for myself, or spend money frivolously besides on weed. I don't have any nice clothes while she has all new designer everything. Right now, I am also unemployed and studying for CPA, so she makes me feel hypocritical whenever I bring up that she should work more if she wants more money. When I refuse to buy her something, she calls her mom and she buys it for her. 


Since she moved in, she's failed out of college (paid for on student loans and me) for basically no reason other than procrastination (and we smoke a lot of pot). She couldn't find a job, so I got her a job working part time with my mom. She is late nearly every day to work, and is on the brink of being fired constantly. I know its a tough job market and her career shouldn't affect the way I feel about her as a person, but I just wish she could be not so dependent on everyone else. It is also a very nice job, 16/hr with a lot of connections with a lot of very wealthy people. 

 

 In the beginning, when I was travelling to see her.. the sex was amazing. we'd fuck everyday, over and over. Since she moved in, slowly dwindled to about once a week. Our sex is still really good, it's just only initiated by me, and I get rejected a lot. Most of the time its because I was mean earlier or how could i wnat to sleep with you after how you treated me? . Which brings me to.. how much we fight

We fight about everything. Little things, big things. We are both big talkers. We'd rather smoke a bowl and talk about stuff than watch TV any day of the week. we share lots of similar interests and stances on things. But we both love to argue, except she gets very emotional about it. She'll be screaming at me for being a bad person because I support some unimportant aspect of a previous conversation about politics. Then Im like wait are you seriously getting angry? I thought this was all in conjecture... But I do tend to play the devil's advocate.

I love this girl to death, shes beautiful, shes intelligent, she shares my interests, we used to have a great sex life, but god dammit we have so many fucking problems. After 5, almost 6 years I'd rather fix this than start over. I feel like I am an asshole to her a lot, so i try and be better, but sometimes she takes the things I say the wrong way. Somtimes I wonder if its because of previous relationships that I expect a certain level of sex or physical attention.

I was never in bad shape, but I've started working out so maybe to raise my attractiveness level. Its funny after all the shit I write, the lack of sex is the most bothersome. I'm starting to hold resentments and its fucking everything up worse. It's hard to be like we should fuck more when we are fighting worse, and that's the reason we arent having sex to be begin with.

To top all this off, she has been major pressuring towards marriage. Shes basically made me give her assurance that I am thinking about getting married. And asks about diamonds, if there are any in the family etc. 

I'd like to add that she has made some effort towards more sex, less fighting, less shopping. It's just enough to make me appreciate her effort and I KNOW she loves me a lot. I have full trust  in her as well. When I think about all of this, I feel like a piece of shit for being like this over sex. Even when I had lots of sex with ex-gfs I was still usually looking for more.. So am I just insatiable? 

wtf do I do? Stick it out, talk to her some more and give her another chance?

So to make a long story long, about a month ago, I caught my girlfriend sexting some other guy. I confronted her, she was at first in denial about it, but eventually came around and apologized for what she did. I forgave her.

HOWEVER, I caught her yet again! 

About a week and half ago, she had an old phone she use to use that she allowed me to use for music to listen to while I work out. Yet, curiosity got me and I went through her text messages. We have been dating since December 2014. So as I was going through her text, she was sexting, sending pictures, etc to 7 different guys ranging from the time we were dating until middle of march. Now, she has a new phone, so I'll never know if she continued this or not 

So, I approached her about it on Monday because even though it happened two months ago, she was still doing this behind my back. Asking her why she was sexting all these guys while we were dating. However, she turned it around on me, made me look like the bad guy here, and said I was being crazy. She was saying that she didnt do anything. And that we are over.

Since, I have foolishly tried reaching out to her but to no avail. She has blocked my number, removed me from facebook and I cant reach her. Im not going to go to her place because I shouldnt be trying this hard to get her attention as it should be vice versa.

But for some reason, because of how she acting, I feel like I did something wrong, which is what she obviously wants me to feel like this.

With that being said, why is she acting like this? Why is she completely ignroing me? Why is she putting blame on me? Is she in denial? 

And most importantly, will she ever stop ignoring me? 

Its Thursday havent heard from her at all. I wont take her back regardless if she does but i guess its dissapointing she hasnt even tried reaching out.

I've been with my girlfriend for almost three years and we’ve been a LDR for the vast majority of it. We see each other on average once every two weeks for a couple of days.

As with every relationship, the honeymoon period was fantastic and it lasted for around a year, then I started noticing a drop in her libido. It's slowly depleted in the last 18 months and I’m unsure on how to act. Her drop in libido coincided with her taking up dancing and getting very close to a guy she danced with. He emotionally manipulated her (he’s a creep) and she ended up breaking up with me this time last year, sleeping with the Salsa guy, then admitting her mistake to me and asked if we could worth things out. After 2 months of deliberating I decided to take her back as I truly believed she was sorry and ashamed of what she'd done, and frankly I wanted to be with her.

Anyway, every other part of our relationship at the moment is fantastic, we're both very much in love and when we do see each other we have a great time together, but she often seems to have very little desire to have sex with me.

As this has been going on I’ve found it quite frustrating and have occasionally brought it up. It kind of became a thing and I now think she feels pressured when it comes to having sex, which I accept is totally my fault (I'm working really hard on not getting frustrated about it). When we do get into bed and she wants to have sex, it takes on average an hour or so to get her warmed up as she finds the idea of getting turned on stressful and she overthinks about it.

I know this is partly my fault but I'm looking for some advice on how I should act in order to try and rebuild our sex life as everything else about our relationship is great and I definitely want to be with her.

Should I play it totally cool and withhold sex from her until her sexual desire comes back? Am I being a class A idiot and should accept that all relationships have problems? I'm open to any suggestions and thankful for any advice.

Context: we are both students that met each other during a foreign exchange in Europe. She is coming from an Asian country, while I'm from western Europe.

We are kind of opposites actually : she is from a wealthy family, very emotional, easy going while I'm from an average-wealthy background, more logical (working in IT field) and the kind of person who wants to plan everything.

Still, we were together for something like 5 months

We spent a week in Paris but broke up because I couldn't stand her attitude. She's behaves too much like a princess and shows what I call too much carelessness and lack of politeness/respect for her surroundings (me included):

- when vendors are busy with other customers, she will just rush to them without waiting for her turn

- when I tell her to close her bag in the subway/in the streets (in not so secured area), she will purposely leave it open with her wallet in full vision (she says there is nothing of value inside so she doesn't care, fact is the bag itself is from Hermes brand), making me worry and a bit paranoid 

- She tore her subway ticket (after using it) just because she wants to (you need it in case of a control) and when I told her, she just told me to leave her alone, she doesn't care to pay a fine

- during a conversation, when discussing who was the most normal between us two (weird question), she said that she was because she had more friends (I'm kind of a introvert/nerdy type). So in her opinion, more friends = more popular = more normal ?

A lot of small details like that added up until the break up where she told me that I'm too controlling. Everytime she did one of those things, I asked her to stop, so It seemed like I repeated myself a lot and harassed her.

I didn't have a lot of relationships that's why I'm not so sure of my opinion either. I understand she is coming from a wealthy standard and can afford to not give a fuck about everything where she is, but we are in a foreign country (visiting) and I find this is just too much immaturity and embarassment for me (these few days I felt more like her dad than her boyfriend always trying to correct her), especially for her age (22)

I always thought this one girl from high school was always really beautiful and had the most interesting personality. We were friends and had some good laughs together but were never too close, although we did have close mutual friends. As high school endured I had other love interests but for some reason she would stick in the back of my mind as the one who was just different, and I always wished I had tried harder with her.

Fast forward two years. She went to a different university freshman year so I had forgotten about her and went on with life. Things changed sophomore year as she came back to my area and went to community college and hung around the mutual friends we shared, the lost feelings came and went and I contemplated the situation again. We were always the ones up late at parties - talking about future adventures and what we wanted to do in life, where we wanted to be...etc. This resulted in us semi-seriously planning a roadtrip this summer and traveling to all the places we talked about. (I still want it to happen)

Fast forward. New years occured and the unimaginable happened. The night was slightly blurry (as expected) but the defining moment occurred when I came to visit her after the balled dropped in a quiet area of the party and she asked me have you kissed anyone yet? I quickly responded, oh, no I haven't!, or something to that extent... She then edged up to me and we both stared into each others' eyes, my heart stopped. Our kiss was so rewarding. It was so unexpected, and I loved its circumstances.

After this things get interesting. We meet again at a friends birthday party about a week later and she holds my hand throughout the night, tells me she's so happy that I came to see her etc... I'm feeling good about what's happening. Her friends even talked to her when they thought I couldn't hear and said how I would be a good person for her. I even heard her say, I know! Sadly, the party took a turn for the worse that night. People began to fight and risking their lives by driving. She was focussed on helping her friend and I was bummed we couldn't spend more time together. I kissed her again that night. I left later in the night and tried to talk to her the next day - no response. No response until 3 days later saying she broke her phone and would only be able to communicate through twitter now.

Let me preface something before I continue. This is the first encounter with a woman where I've felt like I'm the overly-attached and needy one. This is solely based upon our electronic correspondence. I've never texted someone who was so to the point. I'd always try to be witty, funny, flirty, and I never got anything in response. It was so odd though becuase she was the complete opposite in person.

I'm getting too detailed at this point but long story short between her working full time (she's taking a break from school), me going to school, and her not having her phone, things got weird. She bailed on plans that we made 7 times after her breaking her phone. SEVEN TIMES. It would be so hard making the plan because I didn't have a car and she didn't have access to twitter sometimes but it just seemed so flakey. So many, oh I'm so sorry something came up I can't make it. Sometimes she just wouldn't show up without any explanation and I was getting kind of bummed. It came to a point when it was a game...let's see if she cancels on me this time! After 7 times I sent her an essay text explaining that I was done trying to make plans because it felt like she was leading me on. At this point she had a phone finally.

She never replied. I waited a week before my infatuation overcame my logic. I caved and sent her a sorry if I seemed harsh, but we can still be friends type of thing to see if I would get a response. She sent me a decently genuine response like a week later saying she was sorry and that I was right about her being unreasonable. 

I didn't text her back (I tried to forget about her) until about another week later she sent me a message with just my name in caps. I thought I'd see what she wanted. She told me she doesn't get out much anymore becuase of work and invited me to a bar with friends - I skeptically agreed. It was looking good until she didn't answer one of my texts asking her if she could give me a ride and later replied about how she was already parked and asked if I could walk there. It was damn cold, and already late, so I said sorry I couldn't do that. I'm not one to be constantly checking my phone but in such a circumstance if she really wanted to see me I think she would have tried harder.

Fast forward to two days ago. We plan something else because the other night failed. That day I have a crazy day with a job interview/class, and missing class to get my car especially for the date we were planning. I'm two minutes late and she texts me did you forget about me? I was like, woman you bailed on me 7 times you have no room to speak! (didn't really say that) Kind of annoying. Well it all went away because we spent so much time apart I was just so happy to see her after so long. 

Our date went really well. We had some drinks and listened to live music at a really cool, chill bar/ cafe and I finally asked why she treated me like she did. All I got was that she was going through some things, that she was really busy and really sorry, but after I pushed a little more she just said she would tell me later. This made me feel uneasy. But I quickly forgot because the infatuation was again blinding me. The night beautifully continued with laughter, good music, and us hanging out for a solid 4 hours. At the end of the night we were both tired (honestly I didn't want it to end) and in my weird state I asked if I could kiss her. There was some slight hesitation and a little awkwardness but she said yes and I think it was ok. I texted her (I kind of regret this) that I was sorry if I came on too hard but it felt right to do it in the moment. She didn't directly respond but said she had a really good night.

Things seem to be going well, right? Maybe..... This thing with our electronic communication still gripes me though. She's the type of person that doesn't text back until hours later (presumably bc of work) and it's hard to tell if she's for real or not.

We are hopefully meeting in two days and I may surprise her at work tomorrow but I don't know. I don't know if I'm wasting my time or what. I'm a passionate person and with the flakey things she did when I thought things were becoming more serious, I don't know what to expect.

My brother was on his laptop and left it on there while he went to pick up pizza. I was bored, so I decided to surf on reddit from his laptop (it was in the kitchen). I put in reddit on the address bar and a history came up from underneath it. Sure enough, I saw a familiar title and clicked on it. It was one of my gonewild post! I clicked on my username and some of my post were purple (meaning he clicked on them) and even left a comment on one!    Your nipples are perfect

84,1p5ikv,"A few weeks ago 5 of my friends (late 20s m/f) and I took 3 cars to move a married couple to another state that's about 6-7 hours away. I woke up at 5am on a Saturday, rode shotgun with another friend and drove all morning to arrive to our destination. The majority of the work moving this couple in was myself (29f), my friend's husband (30m), and two other guys (mid 20sM). While we were all working to move stuff in their new apartment my friend A (29f) and one other girl C (mid20sF) went to buy everyone food. 

A &amp; C were gone for about 45 min and the rest of us were able to move about 90% of their stuff in the apartment (hooray for efficiency!). When A&amp;C finally got back we took a break while they started to put little things away (like put dishes and cutlery away in the kitchen). 

Sunday afternoon everyone but the husband comes back home. The wife still has another month left at her job before she can officially move. 

A few days after the move the wife we helped went out to dinner at a nice restaurant and invited everyone, but me. The reason why was because the wife did not want to pick me up (I don't have reliable transportation at the moment) and I live 10 minutes away from where she was staying. Everyone thought that she was going to pick me up that night, but when everyone arrived at the restaurant and inquired to where I was.. she responded you know I couldn't have picked her up, it would have been too far to drive back to drop her off home. 

Going out to dinner was her plan, she called everyone up to invite them to this restaurant. The rest of my friends assumed I would be there, and that she had called me to invite me as well. If my other friends had known I wasn't invited because she didn't want to pick me up, they would have offered to come and get me. 

This is probably more of a rant than anything. I felt like this was a really shitty thing to do, especially after I spent an entire weekend moving boxes and furniture for a friend...and she couldn't take the time to drive an extra 20 min to come get me because I don't have transportation right now?

768,289omi,"I feel like I should preface this post by saying I'm no stranger to dating. I've been involved with numerous women, and have had several long term relationships throughout my life. I've been broken up with before, I've felt like my heart was broken before, the whole nine yards. I've never really bought into the whole idea of there being soul mates, or a single person out there that would be perfect for me.

However, all that being said, I met a gal at a party a few months ago. We hit things off right away. We dated and talked every day for about 3 months, and I thought things were going great. I'd never been in a relationship where I felt so comfortable. We could spend hours sitting and talking and it never felt awkward or forced. Everything about it was easy and it just felt right. I hadn't ever felt as strongly about someone as I did her.

A few weeks ago, she called me and told me that she had gotten an opportunity for a job in a town a few hours away from our city, and that she was going to take it, and she didn't think things could work out with her moving. I told her how I felt about her, and asked if we could try to figure out a way to continue things. She said that she really cared about me, but wasn't sure she would have the time to make a relationship work and that she needed a few days to think about everything.

A few days ago, she called again and told me that for the next month she was going to be traveling, then her move and her new job would be taking up a significant amount of time for a few weeks and that she didn't feel right about asking me to sit around and wait until she had time for a relationship. I can respect that, and I'm grateful she was honest with me. We said our goodbyes and I haven't spoken to her since.

Obviously I can't sit around and pine away, but I can't help but feel like I've missed out on something that could have been amazing. Should I try to get in contact with her in a few months? Am I being obsessive and creepy? Should I just move on? I don't know if it's because it's fresh in my mind, but this ending has hit me a whole lot harder than any other one in my life.

1053,29zayx,"So for some back story.. I've been dating Tom for about 6 months. We spend a lot of time together, I've basically been living at his apartment for the last 2 months. Since he lives with roommates, I don't have a set of keys, I just use his during the week. I started a new job as did he, but I work from home most days. I'm moving tomorrow and his lease ends at the end of this month, so he's planning on moving in with me since I'll be closer to his work. Since he's out working all day, I stay home and work and clean the apartment, make him breakfast and dinner (although we go out when I don't feel like making dinner) and I do our laundry every week.

So lately I've been feeling unappreciated. He never takes my plans into consideration. He went home this weekend for the holiday to be with his family, and so did I, since I was leaving too, he took the keys. I told him that I was planning on going to the apartment to do the laundry on Saturday and he was planning on coming back. Well he ended up babysitting his nephew and stayed home, no big deal.

Then I ask him today when he's coming back, he said not until later, and I told him I had to do the laundry, he said I'll definitely be back tonight, my roommates aren't home so they can't let you in

I'm just frustrated that I'm on his time, come tomorrow this won't be an issue, I'll have a new apartment to which we both will have keys for. Is it worth for me to bring this up? Or am I just overreacting and just need to get over it?

734,2b8v6t,"Hey reddit.

Me and my Girlfriend of almost one year (A year on the 25th, actually.) broke up about two weeks ago. We broke up because we were having a really, really stupid argument and I got sick of it. And it's not just my huge ego, even she admits all her friends said it was an incredibly stupid argument on her part. But in the ensuing chaos I made an awful comment that capitalized on one of her major insecurities. Asshole move #1. I realized immediately and said that I went way too far, way, way too far. It's not right to even try to justify that comment, but I was angry and resentful about how I perceived she treated me over the course of our relationship so that really influenced my.. uh decision.

So after that night, I went to see her the following morning to apologize/try and make up/try and get some of my possessions. Needless to say, she wouldn't take me back. Which is understandable because I fucked up really, really badly making that comment. So we don't talk for a few days, but we text intermittently, and I guess we decide that we could get back together given some downtime.

But then that Friday, I chose to get incredibly drunk with my friends. (more drunk than i've ever been before.) At which point, my friends choose to rehash an old situation between me and my ex girlfriend that implied she was seriously considering cheating on me with a mutual friend (this was from a few months ago). But as an added twist, my trustworthy, best friend claims that he 'saw' the text message that implied that.

Asshole move #2. im piss drunk, really pissed off and upset, so I call her up at midnight and start saying all sorts of bad shit, shit along the lines of I'm going to be happy just to spite you, You never cared about me or thought I was attractive. (She was having libido issues), 
You stole a year of my life and didn't appreciate me. etc. Things that I would never have said sober. (I've resolved not to drink for a long, long time because of this.) But after all that died down, my best friend reiterated and said that he never actually 'saw' the text in question. 

So fuck, I made a huge decision based on this guy's testimony, and it's not even true.

Longer story short, In the last week I've been texting her, and she's been actively going on tinder, or to party's trying to meet new guys. And it's all in my face. I was honestly so stupid to believe anything my friends said, because they lied to me when I was susceptible to the lie. I don't blame them for my reaction, but shit. Why couldn't they have done that when I was sober? 

But anyways, I want her back, and I know that at this point she has no reason to take me back. I've tried. I've had to bring her to the Emergency room twice in the past week because shes admittedly somewhat of a hypochondriac because of anxiety issues she has, but I volunteered when she said nobody else would take her.

 I've spent about $100 on her, and i'm planning to bring her for dinner and a movie Friday on what would've been our 1 year anniversary, and I was going to bring her flowers, and write her a long letter. It's kind of inappropriate. I'm seriously thinking not to do those last two things. I feel lousy because I guess i'm knowingly letting her use me. I don't know. I just want her to know how sorry I am.. that i'm willing to sacrifice for her. I offer to pick her up from places if she feels uncomfortable, or just hang out with her 'as friends' if she's lonely.

I'm just ranting though. I made alot of mistakes. More mistakes than I feel outweighs the good I ever did for her. I'm watching her try, and try to replace me as we speak, but I feel like if I pulled away, and stopped talking to her entirely she might really start to miss me and forgive me. I don't know. I should probably just cut my losses and accept it and try to move on.

Just any advice would be great, anything at all. Even words of discouragement would help, like telling me how much I fucked up. It honestly would somehow aha. Self loathing I guess.

Thanks for reading.

because doing long distance for a year would only work if I was confident we would be getting married and I couldn't commit to that when she was the first girl I ever had sex with. I felt like a year apart would either make me realize she wasn't the girl for me or get me to a place where I knew I could be with her forever. Obviously the last month has been pretty rough, especially since she couldn't understand why I felt I had to break up with her and I didn't think it was fair to explain to her I was taking a year off to try to mature enough to make that kind of commitment. Explaining that would basically defeat the purpose of trying to mature since it would leave us both with that in our minds over the next year. 

I love her and hate the ways things are right now, every time I see her around campus my gut just clenches and I can't think about anything else for the rest of the day. I know I have to deal with that, I guess I'm just looking for opinions on my situation. Did I do the right thing? Is it realistic to think we might be able to get back together one day? How do I handle the next month? I want to do everything I can to help her heal, but I also know making kind gestures is just confusing to her healing process. I never imagined myself being the kind to marry young, but what can I do over the next year to best figure it out. I'm scared the only way I can figure myself out is to get a clean slate but doing so would require giving up on her which defeats the purpose since I want to figure myself out to get back with her!

696,35l7y2,"My best friend has been in a relationship with this girl for a little over a year now. I feel like she's emotionally abusive, because she is constantly putting him down, blaming him for everything, and guilt-tripping him, among other things. 


Late last year, he took a rural job for a couple of weeks. She didn't object while he was applying for the job, but once he was accepted, she basically made his life hell - constantly criticising him and saying it was wrong for him to do that, threatening to break up with him, picking fights, giving him the silent treatment. Even now, if anyone brings up that job in front of her, she will get angry and/or stop speaking to him. 


She also gets quite angry at him for wanting alone time, especially if that alone time involves video games - he tries to go to parties, etc. and enjoy them because they are important to her, but the reality is that he finds social situations incredibly stressful and needs time by himself to recover. The video games help with that recovery, because he finds them relaxing. However, she is offended by this and normally doesn't allow him any time to himself, despite how often he has tried to communicate his feelings. They live together, work together, and she also expects them to spend all of their free time together. He tries to compromise with her but she refuses, and he feels like he has to do whatever she wants because she is still holding that rural job over him. 


I have brought up the possibility that she may be emotionally abusive to him before, very gently. He blamed himself for not always speaking up about his feelings - however, from what I've seen, that is not something that he can do without her becoming annoyed, angry, or upset. I am extremely, extremely worried because she is pressuring him to move to a different city where he will not know anyone except for her. Considering his social anxiety, this is effectively isolating him from both his friends and family. What can I do to support him and help him? I don't want to push him on this. He is unhappy and stressed out, but doesn't want to risk losing her.

38,1ndcad,"I began dating her about a month ago after meeting on an online dating site, meaning we had no prior history. During this period of time, things escalated physically rather quickly, already making out by the end of the first date and having sex by the third. Each successive date (now at seven) has culimnated with PIV sex.

She had explained to me very early that she wasn't looking for anything serious. She further stated that due to our interactions, it seemed to her that we were headed towards becoming Fuck Buddies (though this was not my intention.) I told her I understood, though I asked that we agree to be sexually exclusive. I didn't explain the 'why' (STI risks) though she agreed to my request.

We get along very easily and have great rapport. We enjoy conversing and sharing stories, and nearly every joke we make is found utterly hilarious by the other, thus the basis of our relationship can't exactly be said to be primarily seuxally driven.

On our most recent date, I told her I wanted to date her exclusively. She turned me down, saying that it wasn't because she doesn't like me, but because she was really hurt over her last relationship and wasn't completely over it. I asked if she was seeing someone else, to which she replied that she just ended things with a guy she was seeing.

While I understand that she's looking for something casual, the way we interact seems rather typical of a couple. We'll constantly hold hands, cuddle, go out to eat, and act in a manner that would seem to an observer that we're clearly together.

What I want to understand is what is preventing her from wanting to take the next step with me. I wasn't asking her to become my GF, just date only each other. Is it because she's hurt that she hesitates to go to the next level or is it because she wants to simply keep her options open (i.e. waiting for a better guy to come around)

I tried everything to help her but she just pushed me away. I took reddit advice and supported what she wanted and told her I would wait for her. That same day I said that and we had decides to give eachother space she went and had sex with some random guy. I found out last night when she was saying alot of symptoms that pointed to an sti. I asked her if she had sex with anyone jokingly because the very next the day after she had sex with that guy she decided she wanted to work things out with me. Before I found out she cheated I had been buying her roses and caring for you and loving her. She had sex with him Sunday night, Monday morning she texts me and we go for a run and work out with eachother. Ever since then we have been with eachother everyday.

1188,1t41nl,"I have been dating my current gf for a little over 6 months now. Some backstory: we were friends in high school and college, though we went to different colleges, we'd see each other back home or when we went to visit the other person's college, but we'd never go to solely see the other person because we were in the same circle of friends. Basically, we had mutual friends at both universities and at home, and we were friends too, although we never really hung out one-on-one.

Fast forward to when we're both out of school and working at a nearby city. She had been out an entire year before me, and I happened to move to the same city because that's where I got a job. I had been there a couple of weeks and we ended up hooking up after a night on the town - completely unexpected by both of us. We started hooking up casually afterwards, maybe once or twice a week, and then after about 3.5 months we were officially dating. 

So, here's the thing: I have fallen in love with this woman. She does not know this yet. I haven't told her because I know she doesn't love me. She is usually an emotionally reserved person (and tbh, I am as well...usually), but I know I love her. Also, I have never loved anyone like this before, as she is my first legitimate girlfriend. I've had FWBs and flings in the past, but this is the first person I have liked enough to make an SO, let alone fall in love with. And it's not like I'm falling in love with her after 6 months...I've known her for over 8 years. 

Another thing: prior to dating me, she was in a very serious relationship that ended horribly. He cheated on her, she tried to forgive, they ended up constantly fighting and eventually hating each other. After quite a break, they tried to mend it again, but it didn't work...again. About 2 months after that is when I entered the picture. And now here we are. 

I've never talked to her about this, but I get the impression she doesn't want to do the head-over-heels thing, and I feel as though she is actively trying to not invest herself too much in me. As in, she doesn't want the hurt again if anything happens, which I completely understand. But that puts me in an odd position: I love her, and I want her to know that, but because I think she will not say she loves me, I am the one who will end up hurt. I fear that if I tell her, she will just distance herself and eventually break up with me anyway, which is the last thing I want, but I also don't want to corner her either. 

My question is: Does anyone have any success stories with these types of situations? You love someone and they're not ready to tell you they love you...for those of you who have stuck it out and held your breath, how did it go? How did you cope? I'm not exactly looking for advice to make the relationship better (but I'll take anything if you're willing to give me your input), usually I just see stuff like you have to communicate, etc,but I don't want to communicate this just yet.

I do not know if it's me that's wrong with or if I just had the misfortune to meet with bad friends. I love to hang out with women and talk shit and have generally fun. It's totally different than hanging out with the guys(not as fun). I have many guy friends (because I easier find guy friends).


This always happens when I find a group of girlfriends to hang with: I have fun with them, talk a lot and hanging out with them at school etc. But as soon as school is out, the girls starting to hang out with each other, in their rooms and laugh and totally block me out and never invites me.


This has happened to me plenty of times, they are always two girls who hang out with each other all the time and it's like they really did not want another one.


I have heard that girls usually just want to be two in their group. I do not understand that. I've been with guys all my life and never been victim to this when I am with them. My question is: Is there something wrong with me? Or is that girls always do this? If you're a girl and behave like this, why?

I usually only need a cuddle and someone to vent to if I am stressed or going through something bad. The problem is that I have no idea how to help my boyfriend when he's going through a tough time.


He tends to withdraw and act cold towards me when he is very stressed or upset. He's generally a happy person and it's only gotten to that point about five times since we've been together. We have an extremely loving and happy relationship otherwise. The problem with this is that when he acts that way, it makes me feel anxious - I get the whole heart racing, sinking feeling, feelings of dread, and nausea. I only feel that way after I try to cheer him up, cuddle him, say silly things that usually make him laugh, talk to him about it, and I've even asked him what I can do for him (he just says he doesn't know, he just needs time to get over it) and nothing works. Then I start to feel bad myself. I've always been able to comfort my friends and family in times of distress, I usually know exactly what to say or do, but with him I just don't. It feels so foreign and scary.


For example, we were out on a date and he started stressing really badly about an upcoming important work thing. It was also a date to say goodbye before I left on trip. I tried to keep things light and pleasant so I could try to make it a nice night still, but he would just sit there in sullen silence and stare into the distance. It made me feel so helpless, and then those anxious feelings came. I managed to keep my feelings under control and just zoned out a bit. When I drove him home he apologized for acting so stressed.


I have had panic attacks and anxiety since about 2002, but luckily haven't had one all year. But I feel like I'm getting close to one when he shuts off like that. It makes me want to run away from him until he feels better. I really love him and want to stay with him, so I know that it'll be something I'll have to face every now and then. What can I do to try to support him? I feel so useless.

I'm over that crush now (it took forever to fall out of), but I remember what it felt like, and my current feelings for my gf burn much cooler.


I can't imagine us ending up together. This could be because of the gaps in our age and situation. I'm in a much better place than her financially, emotionally, had a better family (hers is awful), etc. 


My gf (Alex) is amazing in so many ways, but —feel like a dick saying it— she's not as quick as me and sometimes our conversations aren't that great. It is something I have a hard time with. It's hard to picture us married.


Which is fine with me! I'm happy to be with her. I'm satisfied with how things are. I feel good when we're together, and even the things that annoy me are tolerable because she's such a pleasant person. 


But the strongest emotions in my relationship are the desire to protect her and make her stronger. There are other things, but a big part of what I get out of the relationship is that I can tell it is truly fulfilling for her.


Alex had a shit boyfriend before me. He pressured her sexually, abused her emotionally, and eventually drove her to a suicide attempt. 


The other night she cried when we were together. When I asked her why, she said it was because she hadn't been happy in such a long time and she finally was. As I held her, I felt good. I felt like I was doing a good job taking care of someone. A sense of strength and self-worth sort of washed over me.

I would feel selfish if I was the only one of us who got to feel like that. She might sometimes, when she does little things to take care of me. But I don't need her the way she does me.

4,3dwdl0,"So here is a little backstory, my parents divorced when I was 5 years old, and never got along, even till this day. I was basically raised by my nana (grandma on my mothers side), and sadly she passed away 4 years ago, so that felt like I lost my mother, since she raised me as a child. So that was a dramatic impact on me, anyways, about my parents. 

My dad has been brainwashed by my stepmother for a lack of better terms, I can't even talk to him on the phone without her listening via speaker phone and telling him what to say to me. The last time I forced him (yes I had to force him, I've had a beer with my old man maybe 3 times my entire life) to go get a beer with me, he just complained the whole time about how expensive a $4 beer was and ultimately ruined the time I was trying to have with him. I can't see him without my stepmother standing next to him, talking for him, what I mean by that is basically i'll ask my dad a question and she will answer for him while he just stands there in silence.

Now my mom, she has been diagnosed with depression (the medical kind where they give you medicine), and I didn't understand this as a kid, but growing up I got used to my mom threatening to kill herself, yelling cause the sink has a dirty bowl in it, telling us we were terrible kids, and throwing stuff down the hallway towards our rooms while screaming. After telling her numerous times to go seek therapy, she finally did a couple years ago, she got MUCH better, but now she quit going and the clock turned back, she is back her old self. What I mean by that is, when I call her, she just complains or when I go over to visit, I walk in and she is just staring at the wall, no TV on, no music, just complete silence sitting on the sofa staring at the wall. I ask her if everything is ok, and she just starts crying that nobody cares about her, and that I don't care about her, etc.. So that's my mom in a nutshell.

Turn the clock to where I am 20 years old, well I was in a relationship with the girl I had known since I was 8 and we had an kid together. We have since separated, but are still somewhat friends (not as close as we were as kids). At this time is when my mom, and I started to drift apart, my mom first asked to abort the kid, then told me to get out of her house since I had a kid on the way, luckily my SO at the time agreed to move in with me to raise our kid and potentially get married so I didn't end up homeless and we managed bills with our $10/hour jobs. That created a riffle in the relationship with my mom, and it's gotten worse due to the depression stuff I mentioned above.

Now my dad, he didn't say much about my daughter, as usual, but was accepting after my daughter was born. Now here comes the part where we drifted apart, I broke up with my SO, and moved in with my dad, (I am now 23 at this point) and things were alright for a while. Until my stepmother started treating me like dirt, and doing things behind my back (long story), and I sat my dad down without my stepmother (very rare) and the response I got from him the entire time I was telling him I had a problem with what was happening was yeah, and when I asked You have no opinion of what's going on? he just stared at me, and went eh. This took a toll on everything, and I told him Well if you won't talk to your son about the issues he is stating, then you can sit there and be an asshole while saying nothing. Harsh, but my anger got the best of me, and my dad, not surprisingly, just sat there and didn't respond. I ended up moving out to my current residence.

So to sum it all up, my mom has become severely depressed, won't seek help, and I talk to her maybe 1 time a month, if that, due to her saying we all hate her, and constant complaining about everything. My father and I haven't spoken in months, and honestly reaching out to him is pointless cause my stepmom will be talking for him on the phone, he himself has not reached out at all, which honestly doesn't surprise me.

So is there anything I can do? I am just considering moving forward with my life, raising my daughter, and leaving them behind as I go on with my own life, and creating memories with my daughter, which in this moment, is the most important thing to me.

We’ll call her Kate. Kate and I have known each other for about 2.5 years. We became acquainted when her and her friend moved in with me and mine. We lived together for 6 months and things were groovy. I always thought Kate was spectacular but she had a boyfriend at the time (and, you know, roommate etiquette and stuff) so it was easy for me to not worry too much about my feels. I eventually started sleeping with Kate’s boyfriend’s best gal pal, so the four of us started spending a lot of time together and there were no issues. Although the living situation was great, we all moved out to do our own things (I went travelling, Kate moved back in with her parents to save money). When I got back, we continued being pretty good friends, and eventually she broke up with her boyfriend. When that happened, I started really realizing how much I wanted her, but tried really hard to ignore my feelings because I didn't think it was mutual, and I really didn't want to ruin our friendship(and I really didn't ever want to admit to being that in-love-with-my-bestie stereotype). Unfortunately, my feelings made it difficult to hang out with her, so like any socially well-adjusted person would do, I started spending less time with her, and event outright avoided her at times. When I'm not avoiding her and we hang out, we still get along fabulously.


Now though, Kate is about to start attending classes at my college and I expect we'll see a lot more of each other. I like and respect her so much as a friend and I wish I could just not like her, because we get along fabulously, but that doesn't seem to be possible, and I'd love to just come out and tell her for the sake of honesty(and possibly to ease my discomfort), but in the end what do I gain? I'm not naive enough to think we would still be the same level of friends if I told her, but having this secret desire for her really sucks, and I feel guilty for being the kind of terrible friend that would do this.

347,2peyx8,"I'm a frequent browser on this subreddit, which my [former?] S.O. knows about. So even though this is a throwaway, I won't be at all surprised if he finds this; there's no point for me to omit details. I'm not really sure how to feel right now. I just want someone to take what I've described here and make it black and white for me. 

*Background:*

We've been dating on and off for almost four years. We've had a lot of ups and downs....a lot of issues...but I love[d?] him despite any of our hardships. We've broken up a few times, pretty much all instigated by him, and one time I refused to get back with him. During these times he'd break up with me, he'd change his mind and want to be together without the title.

Eventually I had enough because I felt like a doormat and he was an asshole to me. He broke off our F.W.B. situation and when he came crawling back, I said no. He wouldn't leave me alone for days and acted like I did the most horrible thing and crushed his soul, despite us technically being over for months. The more he bugged me, the more I wanted nothing to do with him. 

During that period, I ended up casually dating my friend for 2 weeks, but that didn't work out. I dated him because he was smart, understanding, had ambition, and was a nice distraction from the drama I was having with my ex. 

Months pass by and eventually my ex and I reconcile after being no contact. We decided to get back together and take it slow and agreed that what we did, like dating, when we weren't together won't be discussed. 

We went a good almost 2 years without any major issues. No break ups or fwb or anything. He seemed to have changed. Then one day he told me because of our past, his dad told him we would never work. Apparently that had been eating at him for weeks and he had to tell me. It put a rift between us. I'm also graduating school in a couple months and have no idea where I'll land a job [could be here or across the country], which he was stressing about. End of September he broke up with me again...for good because what his dad told him was haunting him and the possibility of me moving away scared him. 

A day later he came back and we both agreed to date again, with the understanding that it was over if I had to leave for a job, since he made it clear he won't be following. We agreed that if we wanted to date other people, we'd tell each other and end things, but for the time being we promised to date exclusively.

**TL;DR: Been together on and off 4 years. One time we were off for a long time, I dated someone else briefly for 2 weeks. We got back together months later. Broke up 2 years after that.**

*Present:*

A couple of weeks ago something happened that really bothered me. At the time, he went to visit his dad 2.5 hours away for a couple of days. The day he got there, he tried calling me but I was working. He told me he was having issues with his stepmom and went to the city. He said he went gambling. Then he decided at like 1 AM to drive all the way home because he didn't want to be near her. I thought that was weird but didn't really say anything.

The next day he brings up meeting up with a girl named Kristen. Kristen and him casually talked online on and off for the past couple of years and went on a date before. He told me she noticed he was in the area on snapchat so they went out gambling and drinking and from there he drove home. I told him that I thought it was weird that he omitted going out with a girl he dated in the past when he talked about it the day before. Hanging out with someone you had feelings for [which he told me he did in the past] is a sort of gray area and that it would have been considerate of him to at least mention it to me before hand. I've hung out in a group with an old high school boyfriend before and know some people would be uncomfortable with that so I've always told him before hand just out of consideration. He blew up at me and made me sound like I was jealous and that they were of course JUST FRIENDS and that's partially why he broke up with me. Eventually he turned it around and apologized and said that he'd mention it next time.

Which brings me to today. This is weeks after this incident. I was annoyed by that situation but by now I thought it was settled. I should mention we work at the same company, but different departments, and were dating before either of us worked there. He told me during my lunch break we need to talk. I thought I did something wrong, so I called. He tells me, I made a mistake. there's someone else. My heart dropped. I asked if it was Kristen. Surprisingly no. He went on a date with another girl from the same company and it's not as bad as I think it is. 

Apparently, this girl asked him out and he said yes when he claims we were having problems [wouldn't give me a time at first...I was confused to what he was even talking about.] They supposedly didn't do anything but go out for dinner and maybe hug. No kissing, no sex, etc. It was platonic. The second he went out with her apparently he felt guilty and realized right then and there he wanted only me and wanted me to officially be his girlfriend again. 

I not only felt betrayed and lied to, but felt like he was trickle truthing me. He told me she had been harassing him since the date and won't leave him alone. That she's been fighting him on the company log, threatening to go to HR, threatening his job, and threatening his life. She's also brought me up to him as well for god knows why [I DON'T EVEN KNOW HER.] They work together every night which he conveniently left out until today. 

I asked when the date was and he said right before thanksgiving. We had no problems during that time which I brought up to him, minus the Kristen thing. So he retaliated with I'm not blaming you, but I know you hooked up with your friend when we were broken up. I looked through your facebook messages and found out and it crushed me. I almost considered breaking up with you for that. That was always in the back of my mind so that must have been why I did it. 

He said he understands if I can never forgive him, but still begged me to stay. He said that he'll probably either quit or lose his job because of her. That if I don't take him back, he'll have nothing left for him here and he'll just pick up and move away. 

This whole thing explains why he's been weird about me being near his phone for weeks...he's been acting like I'm untrustworthy. 

**TL;DR S.O. had a questionable outing with someone he went on a date with. When I had an issue with him about it, he said it wouldn't happen again. Turns out it did but with someone else and this time he does consider it a date and knows it's a betrayal.**

*My thoughts on this:*

I don't know what to think except that I feel his story is bullshit. Kristen isn't the first time he's danced on the line of inappropriateness. But this is the first time he ever flat out told me there's someone else. The way he talked about it was as if something more was going on then he reeled back and made it sound more platonic.

Unless this girl is a fucking psychopath, I doubt they had just one platonic date. For all I know they've been flirting/hooking up for months and when he decided he wanted me back she got angry. Who threatens someone's life over one date that didn't go anywhere???

At this point the only way I'd believe him is if I saw the chat logs and they were in his favor. He conveniently deleted all her texts he ever got from her and can't receive them from Verizon unless something more serious happens...And he deleted his facebook, I guess to prevent her from finding me and reaching out. He won't give me a name...not that I'd reach out to her.

He's trying to convince me he's sorry, that nothing happened, that it was a mistake, etc. I feel like I'm being gaslighted and trickle truthed til I'm forced to believe him...which was really the only thing that made me give up on the Kristen situation. 

For anyone that thinks he technically did nothing wrong because we don't have an official title, we were both in agreement to not date other people without breaking it off first. And he's made it clear if I did the same thing he'd also feel betrayed. 

So my questions are...where do I go from here, how do I cope with this, how badly can this affect my job if she tries to reel me in, and what is the black and white version to make me see things as they are? I feel so lost about this. I know the answer but I don't want to believe it...


**TL;DR: S.O. went on a date, or possibly more, and just confessed to it today out of guilt or necessity. Other girl is livid with him and is an employee, so she's threatening to involve HR and get him fired. There must be more going on...I don't know how to feel.**

Edit: Even if what he says is true, it doesn't make up for the sketchiness behind everything. I don't know if I can ever trust him again just for the fact that he keeps hiding things from me and yet had the nerve to look through my personal messages.","Me [22 F] with my S/O [25 M] 4 years, went on a date behind my back...possibly more...",0,False,1,7,1418689562,/r/relationships/comments/2peyx8/me_22_f_with_my_so_25_m_4_years_went_on_a_date/,Romantic
652,3fvvai,"I started to get slowly more and more depressed when I was 16. Before I always got top grades and won a lot of competition in various fields and traveled a lot for these and other projects. When I was 17 I skipped school more often than not, but somehow nobody noticed because they where used to me being busy with something else. I told my parents that I stoped participating in other stuff to concentrate on school and told my teachers that I was busy with other projects. Somehow all teachers loved me and gave me good grades anyway because they just assumed I was still busy doing awesome stuff whenever I wasn't at school.

But now I'm studying and I failed a lot of exams and got really bad grades in the rest. I tell my parents I was doing ok with my studies and they were really disappointed that I'm not getting the very best grades like they expected me to.

While I was living with my parents I was arguing very often with them because they are really conservative and religious and I'm neither. They almost threw me out when I told them about me having a boyfriend ( I was 17). As soon as I finished school I told them that I and my bf will move to another city to study there. My parents were furious and told me moving to this city is stupid because they live only 1,5 h away from a really elite university (which doesn't offer the subject me and my bf want to study and is really expensive). Somehow, by being stubborn and saying stuff like either you pay for me studying where I want or i wont study at all, I made them agree to pay for me studying in the city I want to. I still feel really shitty for blackmailing them like that but at that time I just couldn't imaging myself living with them for another year. Money isn't really an issue for them, they have more than enough and I live very frugal (it's amazing how much money you save by being to depressed to leave your room, yay...).

My boyfriend is the one who is 100% responsible for me getting out of my depression, he was one of the first with whom I talked about it, is always there for me, made me finally see a therapist and now we moving in together and I'm really happy with him.

My relationship with my parents is getting better and better, we get along pretty fine as long as nobody mention anything related to religion or my boyfriend...
I know that they always wanted to do what's best for me, they just have the wrong picture of what's actually good for me.
It really bothers me, that I can't talk with them about my depression. I'll spend the next six weeks with them, and just always having to lie about what I did the last 3 years really brings me down and I want to finally tell them.

On the other hand, I'm really afraid of their reaction. I'm afraid that they'll blame my problems on me being atheistic and me living so far away from home. They often mentioned how unhealthy they think it is for me to live on my own at such a young age. And if they think it is the best for me, they will stop paying my rent and everything, that's something I'm really horrified of, because I still have too many bad days to hold a job and without their financial support I'd have to move back in with them, where I would be 800 km away of my bf, my friends and everything .

But somehow I have to tell them something, because they expect me to finish my degree next semester, but I won't be able to do that. What should I do?

There is nothing sexual between us any more. When we hang out he is grumpy about something or the other. He doesn't scold me or anything. But, he is just upset about something or the other.

1210,2wmjiw,"I first developed anorexia a year ago. At first I just ate healthy and exercised and felt really good about myself. However, several factors which i'd rather not go into detail about drove me to control food and excessively exercise.

 I ended up very underweight and while I have gained some of the weight back since then (I'm 2 kg underweight by bmi now) I still have no period.

I don't starve myself anymore - but I still have a massive fear of butter and oils - I use them but I measure them out so I make sure i'm not over consuming them. My mum however uses an entire stick to cook steaks. I find it very difficult to eat if she cooks at dinnertime. 

She takes this very personally and our relationship has suffered a lot since then. She says because of me the rest of the family can't enjoy their food anymore and that She's hurt because she thinks that I believe she's trying to poison me when it's nothing to do with her. 

I once told her when I was really unwell that the obsessive thoughts were in my head all day and that it was incredibly difficult. She called me crazy in front of the whole family and since then I haven't shared anything with her. She doesn't understand my problems at all and she doesn't try.

My mother is overweight and I have a massive fear of ending up like her. 

Of course this makes me want to starve myself even more - so I end up relapsing and the cycle continues. 

i've been doing really well lately - and my dad's been really supportive.  I eat healthy but i eat enough. But every time my mum wants me to eat something she's made it's full of shit i don't want to eat or It's something I don't like and she gets offended and insults my eating habits like You eat weird shit all the time.

1172,1oytxi,"So the story goes like this.
Currently 20 year old perma virgin studding at uni in my third year of a rather small course where there is much mixing between the different year levels. 
A Russian international started up the coarse mid semester (she is in first year).
We started running into each other and hanging out, studying together start to fall for her.

eventual asked her out to lunch the two of us and ended it with a kiss.
I invited her to a party out at my folk's farm, she did not no many people there only me and one of my mates, and a few she had seen around uni but not really well.
Had a good night we chatted, BBQed, had fun messed around with my mates and general stuff. 
when it was getting late I let her have my sisters bed, I stayed up make sure everyone got to sleep all right (around 3:00 am now).

she came out and had lost her camera, I gave her my jacket while we looked and i eventually found it. she then went back to her room and i gave her a kiss goodnight. approx 15 min later she came back out and asked saying she could not sleep and felt like going for a walk. we walked down to the paddocks where she than told me to chase her to stay warm (very cold night), we ran around a bit then i took her into an embrace and we went to grass, made out and had a bit of underclothes action before heading back to the house.

The next day all seamed good we walked around and chatted a bit before I drooped her at the train station so she could get back to the city. Gave her a kiss goodbye then went home.

Then, about 4 hours latter i received a text stating the following Hey I feel kind of uncomfortable about what happened last night.. Can we just leave things as they were before?
I texted her a bit confused and got this response It's all good. I just thought that we would work out much better as friends than as a couple:)

WTF did i do wrong, things seemed to be going great? We where chatting for ages before this happened, when we went out it was good.

Would it be ill advised to meet up with her and talk about it? how would i do this without looking like a desperate idiot?

565,1l4axe,"Me and my boyfriend have been together for 2 years now. Our relationship started out great, as do most relationships I guess. We were both madly in love with each other and spend a lot of time together. It went great, but after a while we both had a few things that bugged each other. I couldn't really get along with his family mostly because they talk in a different language and I just felt so lonely and left out most of the time. It ended up with me barely getting any social interaction with them. I brought it up a few times, but he said there's basically nothing he can do which I think is fair, his arguments were that it's hard for them to switch to Dutch when I'm around because they've been talking their language for years without it bothering anyone.


He never really brought up things about me that bugged him, but I'm pretty sure there were a few as well. My biggest issue is that I don't have a lot of money to spend on fun things to do, and I told him he should just go out with his friends if he wants to and that I don't mind, but he's the kind of guy that spends the night with me because I can't go out. After like a year, I was having doubts if I wanted to stay with him, I just wasn't sure and I didn't envision my entire life being with him.... I never brought up the issue though, I figured I'd let things run it's course and see how it ended up. Fast forward a few months, and I started to see again how amazing he is and I'm so lucky to be with him, he is the sweetest and most caring and most handsome guy I've ever been with, so things were good again, bar the few arguments we have about some little things but those were usually resolved pretty quickly.


Today, he came to visit me again after he was out with friends the entire weekend. I noticed he was pretty distant but I figured he was just tired as he said he had a wild weekend. I was happy for him and he told me a few fun stories about what had occurred. Right before heading home, I asked him why he was so distant and not his usual self. Basically, he told me he thought our relationship wasn't going that well because we argue about lots of little things... but he didn't know how to bring it up. It caught me by surprise because I actually felt like it was going better. I just told him I wasn't going to have this conversation in the last 15 minutes before he was heading out (he had a train to catch). 

I.. I just don't know what to do. I'm shaking right now, my heart feels weird, and I've just been staring at a wall. He's my best friend and I don't want to lose him.. but I don't want to be in his way of being happy either. I don't know if I should call him when he's home to talk about things. Looking back there were a few signs that he was thinking about it.. after calling me he'd usually say 'i love you', but he stopped saying that recently and he also stopped saying it in his WhatsApp messages. I did notice that though but I chose to ignore it basically :(

I was like cool, but the rest of our group never got to meet her and he was kind of secretive about it. Then after hearing a lot of stuff that didn't make sense I asked if she was married. He said yes, at first her husband didn't know about their relationship and she kept it from him because he was a really jealous person. I told him I didn't really think it was a good thing to do, but I really couldn't say much. I said that I would try not to judge since I didn't know the whole situation.

So he ends up bringing her over one night to play cards. She keeps running into the bathroom and keeps saying she has to be home before one. She had been drinking quiet a bit. He and my fiance go to the gas station to get her more alcohol and she starts asking how I feel about jealousy. I say that I think it is a natural part of human nature, but not if it gets extreme and abusive. I said that I think it might be something left over from our earlier ancestors or whatever. Then she tells me this story about how she was gambling in Vegas and her boyfriend at the time got mad. So he supposedly attacks her with a machete and she has blood all over her white ball gown. She said it looked almost picturesque and that he left her there and took everything including her shoes. She went back to him however, because he bought her a cello.

It sounded like bull, but I just kind of nodded and gave the obligatory that's awfuls. She then said she was adopted as a child. She says that another reason she hates jealousy is because she felt like her adoptive parents felt they owned her. She says that she is polyamouros, which I'm okay with, but I don't think she told her husband that before he married her. I think that would have been a whole different situation.

So they come back and she continues drinking. She ends up checking her blood sugar and announces that it is over 600. My friend helps her take her insulin, and she calls her doctor. Then she said she had to go home. I ask my friend if he is giving her a ride, but she declines the ride. She says that even though she may be a smart person that she gueses she is still primative. I mention to my friend later the next day that it was shitty she drove home drunk. My friend ends up getting mad at me for being judgemental.

So fast forward to about two weeks from now. My friend and I work together. I often paid him to give me rides. He mentions that this day his girlfriend would be taking me. She shows up to my house acting crazy. I find out later that she was drunk. She starts dramatically claiming that she is going to comit suicide and drives like a lunatic. She tells me that no one cares about her before dropping me off. I found out that indeed she had been drinking and I get pissed. My friend defends her and says she can't help it and that she is suffering from alcoholism. He says she was worried about a domestic violence charge coming up on her background check from machete man. I asked why would it matter if she was the victim? I end up ending the friendship (which is a little awkward since we work together, but not too bad because we work in different departments). I go to work one day and I see her there. Apparently we now work together and it creeps me out to no end. I can't stop feeling afraid. I talk to my friend, ask wtf and he says that she is only working there for a short-time while she is getting trained for her other job. I tell him the place that she is supposedly working for offers paid training and he said he didn't know that. I feel kind of stuck because although we plan on moving soon, I can't quit my job. I already suffer from really bad anxiety and am trying to get through school. It all just seems to be piling up and I don't need this. Should I just pretend it isn't happening?

821,3dp4gp,"So my boyfriend and I have been dating about half a year. I vaguely knew about his previous relationship that lasted a few months, with a girl I'm going to call Tara. We started dating a bit over a month since they broke up. Today I learned that Tara has a boyfriend that she's been dating over 3 years now. Turns out she was cheating on her boyfriend with my boyfriend.

I don't even know where to start with this update, it's still such a mixed bag. Again, I apologize for the length. 


I usually stay at the apartment on weekends, but as I didn't want to deal with any of the Jenny junk, I stayed at my own place. After the text conversation that Matt tried to keep going, on Friday night I sent him a message that basically said You've heard what I have to say, and I feel like you're not listening. You keep telling me that what I want is most important, but right now that's not what I'm hearing. I'm done talking about this tonight. I made the original post, and ignored his messages on Saturday. I didn't want to say something I would later regret.


Saturday night, I sent him the link to the original thread. About an hour later, he let me know he read it. I asked him about his thoughts on it, and our conversation went like this. 

&gt;Him: Okay, I read it.

&gt;Me: And?

&gt;Him: I know she needs professional help. And that's what she's going to get.

&gt;Me: Good.

&gt;Him: Two of those comments say you need to dump me.

&gt;Me: They have their reasons. From their view, you're putting some other girl in front of me. 

&gt;Him: What about from your view?

&gt;Me: I feel like you're putting some other girl in front of me. 

&gt;Him: I'm sorry I made you feel like that.

&gt;Me: Look at our messages last night. Am I wrong in feeling like that?

&gt;Him: I didn't mean to come off like that.

&gt;Me: Well, that's how you came off. 

&gt;Him: I'm sorry. I love you.


The conversation went on, and he agreed to talk to Jenny and her social worker about going to sober living. He agreed that if anything else negative happened with the situations, he would step back. 

-

Jenny did end up back in the apartment (not in our room, and Matt started locking the door), Matt said talking to her about sober living was like talking to a brick wall, but there was some hope because she was going to a group meeting in a couple days. All hope went out the window within 24 hours. She hadn't even been home a day and she started ripping through the apartment's liquor cabinet, screaming at Matt about how she needed a drink. He tried to help her one more time, told her he'd help in any way he could, and when she continued to go for the booze, he told her Know what? Fuck it. I've spent all this time and energy trying to help you, and you clearly don't want it. Do what you want, I'm done, and he went up to his room and locked the door. He started basically ignoring her. Being civil, but disconnected. 



So Matt came by a couple days ago to pick me up to spend the weekend. And he brought me up to speed on how the week had gone so I would be prepared. Jenny was drinking again, blaming it on Alex, and telling everyone it was okay, because she was just drinking beer. She had gone to five meetings that week, but came home after every one and drank. They breathalyze at this particular program, so she'd stop drinking at a certain time before the meeting to breathalyze sober. She found a liquor store within walking distance and took the money her mum was sending her to pay us back to go buy herself booze. Alex was looking for flights to send her back home. Everyone was basically just tolerating Jenny, but not doing or saying anything. And Jenny knew everyone in the apartment was pissed at her. 


When I got into the apartment, she started trying to hug me, and it was obvious she was wasted. I wanted to punch her. I really did. But instead I kind of shook her off and put my shit upstairs. Matt and I left the house for a few hours to go on a date. When we came back, I went upstairs, into our room, into our bathroom, and locked the bathroom door. I'm barely in there for 30 seconds before I hear Jenny running up the stairs calling my name. I hear the bedroom door open, and I hear the bathroom door knob jiggle. She's crying and telling me that she needs to talk to me. She tells me she's going to lie in front of the door until I'm done because she needs to talk to me. I spent a couple extra minutes collecting myself, I text Matt with She's up here. GET. UP. HERE. And I opened the door. She is, as she said, lying in front of the bathroom door. Since I'm an empathetic wuss, I went help her sit up, intending to just put her to bed, and she drags me down into a hug going I'm sorry I know you're mad, but Alex is- 


She didn't even finish because I fucking LOST IT. I'm usually pretty good at keeping my cool, I work with children, I have the patience of a saint, but after two months of this bullshit I'd had it. I pushed her away, but I stayed seated(being at eye level when you chastise someone, occupational habit) and I went into a rant. I didn't yell, but I ranted. No. No, fuck you. Don't you blame this shit on Alex. Alex didn't fucking put another bottle in your hand. YOU DID. YOU walked to the liquor store. YOU bought yourself booze. YOU started drinking again. YOU are trying to blame Alex so you don't have to take responsibility for your actions. Both my parents are fucking recovering alcoholics. I've been going to meetings since before I could walk. Don't you fucking dare say it's someone else's fault. Don't you fucking dare look me in the eye and say 'Alex did this.' Alex didn't fucking do this. YOU DID. 


She meekly tried to tell me that it was okay because some other girl in her group had relapsed. And I got madder. You wanna fucking know what a relapse is? A relapse would require that you STOPPED drinking. You're going to these meetings, listening to recovering alcoholics who are actively trying to get better. And then you come home and get fucking wasted! That's fucking disrespectful. You didn't even make it twenty four hours out of the fucking hospital before you bought yourself a fucking bottle. You remember why you were in the hospital? You remember what you fucking told me the doctors said? If you had waited five more minutes you'd be dead. And that's not because of Alex, or Matt, or anybody else, that's because of YOU and your fucking bottle.  


She then said she wished she was dead. A manipulative move, an attempt for sympathy. That's fucking selfish. You wanna know why? Because there are four fucking people in this apartment, and five if you include me, who have spent two fucking months trying to help you get clean. Your friend Alex of fifteen fucking years flew you out here to help you. And you're throwing it away, and destroying every single fucking one of us in the process. We are tired. We are pissed. And that pisses me off more that you'd give me that fucking ploy, because you KNOW it would destroy other people. You really want to die? You really wish you were dead? Fine. Keep drinking. And we'll shove you back on a fucking plane and you can go drink yourself into a grave at home.


She started crying and said she did want to get better, but there was nothing else to do in the apartment. You really want to get better? Stop drinking. Stop walking to the fucking liquor store. Stop buying booze. You want to go for a walk? Walk in the other fucking direction. You want something to drink? Go get a glass of fucking water. You want something to do? There are six fucking computers in this house. Learn to do something. I bought a shit ton of stuff you can bake and cook really easily. Bake some fucking cookies. You have no fucking excuse, no one to blame but yourself. So you can either stop drinking, or you can drink yourself to death back in your own state, because I don't feel sorry for you. I'm pissed at you, and I'm fucking done dealing with it.


I walked away. The shit I typed out is kind of a general over veiw. I don't even know how long I ranted at her. She kept trying to make excuses, and I ranted a rebuttal back at every one. I kept at it until I was empty, and everything I wanted to say was out. And then I went to sit out on the porch with Matt. Part of me felt like I overreacted. But another part of me was relieved I had gotten all of that off my chest. Matt told me I should have just stepped over her and ignored her, and he's right, I should have.

Yesterday Jenny didn't really talk to anyone. She came down to the common areas a number of times. To my surprise, she kept refilling a glass with ice water. She made a couple things of ramen noodles. She didn't drink. Yesterday was the first time I've seen her out of the hospital and sober. I don't know how long it will last, and I can't really find myself caring. Alex is searching for flights to send her home, and when he get paid next week, if she's so much as touched a booze bottle she's gone.

I dont want her to feel as though i dont want to spend time with her, its just that sometimes i want to do something different.

374,3en2vw,"In our workplace we have rotational duties, things like locking up the office, doing up an attendance list and things like that. I (M19) was taken off the roster by the old boss because I have a mental illness and I am aware that it is unfair to the other workers (M19-22) so I make it up to them with other means. Despite not being rostered, when they ask me to do things like the attendance list when they're busy I have never turned them down, because I am aware that I am effectively doing less work than them.

Today, I am told that I have to make up almost 50 duties backdated since the day I arrived in the office almost a year ago, duties which they claim i never did a single one, which I unofficially did at least half. No one discussed any of this with me. I feel that this is unfair most of all because I was not involved in the discussion. All along, I've been doing them favors such as buying them lunch or drinks without asking to be paid back or taking their other more time consuming (half-day long) official duties when they were busy with other things or running around delivering and collecting things for them or looking after certain people for them. 

And the fact is, when I do things like the attendance list its not recorded that I did it, rather on the list it is still counted that the person rostered did it despite me doing the work, so its impossible for anyone to actually know how many that I did, which I am quite sure was at least 50% of what I supposedly owe.

I just can't believe that they've been so secretly calculative and I suspect that its a plot from the more lazy members of the office in order to get out of doing duties. I suspect they're also taking advantage of the change of boss in order to put me in this situation, as the old boss was quite sensitive to mental illness and would not hesitate to look after me. I know that they chose this moment to pull this stunt right after the old boss left because if they had tried to do this while the old boss was around, he would have told them to do something not very polite with themselves. 

The sad thing is, if they had asked politely, I would have gladly agreed to do a few extra duties a month.

TLDR: colleagues suddenly want me to repay backdated duties from a roster that I was not listed on. All along I've been 'paying' them back in favours such as buying lunch for free, sending documents etc as well as doing their duties when they're busy. They did not discuss this with me at all.

Right now he's focussed on getting hired in a field he went to school for, volunteering, and otherwise trying to get ahead in his life and career. Very standup, family-oriented kind guy. 

This last week, his work has become intensely busy and the hours long. He has two jobs on top of volunteering and is actively going through the process of getting hired in this other field. He does physical training as much as he possibly can to be prepared for this field.  

Without a doubt, all his time is taken up by these things and he recently severely cut down on our communication. We live far apart and only see eachother once a week. This week he didn't make it to see me at all. Today, he did not return a single text. This has never happened before. To summarize what he texted me yesterday, he needs alone time to sort things out and figure out how to fix everything. He says he has no time for himself, much less myself and his family. I said I understand, I want to support him, and to let me know what I can do to make things easier on him. I said I love him (not the first time of course), I want to be by his side. I asked if he meant he wanted to end things. He said 'To be honest I don't know. This isn't working for me and I don't know how to fix things'. This is the last I've heard from him. It was yesterday afternoon.

984,2xaosf,"After around 2 months of dating this girl broke it off with me for the most baffling reasons and left me pretty upset, and also paranoid of there being someone else. She said that she wanted to be friends and didn't want this to change anything. I conveyed to her that assuming we could just go back to a normal friendship after dating was asinine, and that I was upset with her lack of clearness or honesty and for all the hurt she put me through. 

She freaked out upon hearing this as I heavily implied Id be cutting off contact with her, begging me to talk to her again and to stay in her life. I complied because I was inexperienced and too stupid to realize that just because someone else is melodramatic and upset  and emotional doesn't mean their statements carry anymore weight then they otherwise should. I told her we'd need a while to move on because there was no way we were going to be able to just reassume a normal friendship like that. This lasted around 3 days before she started messaging me and calling me saying she missed me and that she was really afraid I'd moved on and was leaving her. 

We talked about it and I told her my feelings were still there if hers were, and she said she still did have feelings for me but no real clarity came out of this conversation. She still wanted to stay in the weird friendship status and she invited herself over to hangout on the closest opportunity she could. There she started getting closer and closer to me until she was full on cuddling with me and I was left very stressed and confused but didn't want to say anything because I didn't want the cuddling to end. I talked to her again after this and she said she didn't know what my feelings were and when I told her I did want a relationship again that she wanted that as well and that she needed someone like me in her life and that thinking of getting back together with me made her really happy. 

We took it slow after this and I thought it was going ok, she came to my birthday party and met some of my friends which went well, and she came over and we watched the fault in our stars while cuddling. After the movie finished we spent around 10 minutes making out and she was literally lying on top of me straddling me. I feel like this definitely would have gone further had my parents not been home packing for our vacation. 

I went on vacation for a week after this and due to unfortunate timing she left for her vacation the day I came back. We talked in what limited chances we had while we were both away-she was quite flirty and seemed like she was still very interested and I got her flowers and chocolate delivered to her house for valentines day (I feel like this was so fucking stupid and such a waste now, she didn't hint anything was wrong when this happened either she seemed elated). 

We didn't talk too much during her vacation, and when she came back I was eager to see her again. I texted her that night asking her how she was feeling and such, and she basically told me she was no longer interested in a relationship because she didn't think that's what she wanted anymore.

 I was of course very upset and called her about this where she explained that since Id waited so long to make a move and initiate the relationship that she'd seen me more as a friend then a romantic partner and that had always been in the back of her head when we were together and when I thought we were getting back together. She said she didn't want to lead me on and that she didn't want to hurt me. 

During the phone conversation I was very accommodating and I don't know why, I should have dragged her over the coals for all the shit she put me through. She told me to not wait and be more confident in my future... We are back to not talking again and she is still fucking interested in some friendship type shit as she told me just talk to me again when your ready, I really want to be friends with you still and it makes me really upset to think of you leaving my life.

I don't know why any of this had to happen or why it had to be like this at all, she told me many times she thought I was the most amazing, incredible genuine guy she'd ever met and she said she started hanging out with my in the first place because she thought I was super hot so I don't know what aspect of the relationship I failed her in. 

I don't even know what I'm going to do now. I'm having trouble moving on from this because it was so arbitrary and abrupt, and it still hurts a lot to think about any kind of relationship or romantic scenario. I want to do something to hurt her back for all the bullshit I dealt with, and I also feel foolish for believing her when she said so many of those things. I just don't know what to do or feel all I know is this hurts a lot and makes me feel so regretful and unsuccessful and deprived. I would deeply appreciate the wisdom or even just the advice of someone who has more experience in relationships, and life in general, then me. This sucks.

780,2sb5a4,"I was in a relationship with this girl about a year ago. We had a ton of fun and there was a fantastic connection. Chemistry, similar morals, similar things we enjoy doing, etc. We spent most of our free time together the entire relationship. We drove to work together, gym, dinner, frequent dates, etc. When it was great, it was perfect. When it wasn't, it was terrible. She could be insensitive at times, incredibly emotional and even mean. It stressed me out to the point I actually got heart palpitations and started heart medication. Towards the end of the relationship I think it's possible she cheated on me.

We broke up about a year ago. In the last few months we have started being friends again. We'd hang out, go hiking, meet up with a big group to watch football, etc. Last night we went to a concert together, one thing lead to another and we ended up sleeping together. 

After, she pretty much let everything out she was feeling. She missed being together, understood she was completely terrible to me and wanted me back. She regrets a lot and admits she was terrible to me. 

To add onto this, she's changed a lot. She's a lot more grounded and mature. I was sort of her rock to lean on before will all her health problems and issues financially. She traded in her car for one with a lower monthly payment she likes less since it's more affordable and is renting a room to save cash as well instead of an expensive single bedroom apartment and is trying to pay off her debt. She's dropped her spending a lot. Her health problems have gotten more under control too. New doctor found out what was wrong and she's on the right meds now. 

Oh and what's better is that I'm keeping her at arms length and she's chasing me.

I hope you understand the conundrum I'm in. haha. I'm not sure if I'm losing my objectivity because I really care about her still and I should run or if I should give this new and changed (or at least more grown up version) of my ex gf a chance.

575,1kiplw,"Normally I don’t usually use reddit just creep lol but I could use the outside help on this situation. So I met this friend way back in 1st grade but never really talked to her just kind of went to school with her. Now we have only really recently started getting extremely close about 2 months ago. As we keep hanging out i start to learn more and more about her to the point where i am the only one in her life that truly knows everything about her. Now before I get into why she is so depressed and what I’m doing to help her. About a month or so after we started really hanging out I told her how I felt about her but, I also told her that i am ok if we just stay friends because I am really enjoying the friendship.

So the reason she is so depressed is that she might end up going to jail on some bullshit charge. That the court won’t drop even though the victim agrees to drop the charges on my friend. So here she is going through this which if she gets convicted could fuck up her entire life. I mean she will lose everything because she is currently working with elderly in a retirement home. So if she gets sent to jail she will have a record and therefore can’t do her job anymore or anything that relates to taking care of people which sucks. She is also trying to go to school for biology so that will get fucked up as well. Now on top of that she is hiding this whole thing from her parents because if she gets sent to jail or gets put on parole they will kick her out of her house. See if she gets put on parole she will just have a parole officer search her house every week to make sure she doesn’t have any alcohol or anything like that because when this situation happened she happened to be drunk. So now the courts think she is some kind of alcoholic. And if she doesn’t get sent to jail then most likely she will have to go through some bullshit treatment program for a problem she doesn’t have. I mean this is what is crazy about this situation she doesn’t get in trouble like this so that is what is freaking out about this. So either way you look at this if she is convicted at all she is going to lose her home. Now I tried offering her my house to live at but she can’t because of my alcoholic father( another story for another day). She can’t live at a house with alcohol in it if she gets put on parole and goes through this treatment course. 

So here is my question to you reddit what am I to do about this. I keep trying to tell her everything is going to be ok but, honestly it might not and this might destroy her life. Now I have told her time and time again that i am here for her and whatever she needs i will help with. Honestly though it doesn't seem to matter she seems to get more and more depressed and I don’t know what to do or say to her. She says every now and then how it would be so much easy if she just killed herself. And inside that kills me that she would say such a thing, because we have gotten so close and I don’t know what I would do if she really did go through with it. So I’m just stuck in this situation where she is always depressed and I feel so powerless and useless. So any advice you guys can give would be greatly appreciated and sorry for the wall of text but, had to explain the whole situation lol. 

tl;dr: A friend might be going to jail for something she doesn’t remember and wanted to no part in just happened to be drunk at the wrong place at the wrong time. Which is cause her to be extremely depressed and I don’t know what to say or do to help her out.

I know this is my issue and not hers but I just don't know how to deal with it. The reason its such a issue to me is probably because I had only slept with one other person before I met her.

We never fought, and she never gave any impression that she disliked me (in fact she asked me to hang out when I was home for winter break, though I ignored her.) I had no reason to assume she and I were on bad terms.


Because Sabrina and I were at one point close, I had told her some personal things about myself that were a little contentious, but not outright awful. For the last year or so, however, we haven't really been in close contact.

I started dating my boyfriend, who I'll call Mark, at university abroad, though we had met a couple years earlier. Mark went to high school with Sabrina, and towards their last year in school they began to get close and even went to prom together, though Mark swears up and down he never had any romantic intent or relationship with her beyond that. Mark admitted to me that while they had been close earlier during his senior year, as graduation got closer he began to get more and more irritated with her to the point of cutting her out of his life.

Though I'd met Mark a couple years earlier, we hadn't really kept in contact. I found out we were bound for the same university program and got in touch with him, to which he acted quite strangely and distantly. I thought maybe he was shy or something, especially as we got closer throughout our first semester and eventually started dating.

After a while Mark confessed the reason he had acted so oddly to me was because Sabrina had told him a laundry list of awful things about me, so much so that she convinced him he needed to avoid me. This on its own didn't bother me too much––we weren't even close anymore––so I let it go.

Today Mark got a message from one of his best friends back in our home country stating that Sabrina (who isn't even close to Mark's friend) took it upon herself to ask him if Mark and I were dating, and that she needed to save him from me since I had clearly brainwashed him into being with me and that last time [she] checked Mark hated me.

A little background of me:
I am a scientist living in South USA and I do not conform to typical gender roles and looks. So much so that I am often written off as a lesbian (I have been told this by almost countless people). While I don't give a rat's ass if people think so, it has made dating difficult. I ask more often than I am asked out. 

About coworker:
About a month ago, the company I work for hired a guy I will call Ted. Ted has been hired as lead of a department in the company. I do not work for the same department nor is he my superior in any way. He is from another part of the US and only moved to the south about a month ago. He is cute and very intelligent and has a nice personality from what I can gather from the little bit of conversation I have had with him. I like him but I keep it to myself since I am afraid to make an awkward work situation. 

Situation:

A couple days ago, two lady coworkers (Jane and Sam) and I were having lunch and talking about our dating lives. We mainly spoke about how Sam and I were lacking in the dating department of our lives and recounting a few awkward dates. No bashing, just weird situations we have encountered. Since our break room is small, everyone in the room can hear your conversation. Ted finished his lunch about 15 mins before us and comes over to our table. We all converse with him for a few minutes. Before he leaves the break room he looks at me and mentions that we should get a beer sometime. I say sure and after he leaves I turn to my two coworkers and ask if that really happened and the agreed that he kinda asked me out. I turned red as a beet. :) 

Point:
It's a rarity that I find someone that I am excited to know more about. I am a bit concerned about seeing a coworker socially and potentially dating them. I have never done that but I have heard awful stories. Is this the norm? Has anyone here had good experiences dating coworkers? Out of all my previous relationships, I only have two that I do not have a friendly relationship after breakup. Those two I cut out of my life due to abusive behavior.

-----------------------------------

I, fresh into high school, met a girl, who I ended up dating. We don't really have too much in common, just kind of hit it off. About a month in she starts talking to me about this guy (18) that identifies as a girl who she's in a long distance relationship with, and that they regularly 'play' with each-other over Skype. Then, she introduces me to pet play, it turns out I like it, now I'm this girl's pet.


About two months in I'm at her house, we're on the couch. We cuddle and she pets me and stuff, it's awesome, then it progresses to heavy petting, and now everything is sexual and she wants it right then and there. But it's the couch at her parent's house, they could come in at any moment, they're just outside. I decided that it was the wrong time, at the wrong place, told her what's wrong and why, things died down. 


It seems a bit unimportant, but I think this event is what made her start to like me a lot less. 


After this I'm on winter break. On Christmas eve she sends me a text saying she's breaking up with me. I cried, a lot. My shitty and convoluted writing doesn't do justice to the incredibly strong feelings I felt towards the girl, the fact that she was also my owner only made it hurt worse. 


After spending the rest of the break being in a terribly upset state; she wants to get back together, but this time she's asking if I'm okay with a polygamous relationship, and wanting me to be her pet exclusively. I'm totally fine with that, and don't mind at all, but what I actually ended up in was an open relationship, in which I sat on the sidelines while she sucks face with whoever she finds to be attractive this week. 


The most attention I've gotten since was a kiss on the cheek, not even a conversation. 


She's ignoring me now, and it's really upsetting. Just last week I decided to talk to the long distance relationship guy about it, since I was feeling neglected and my girlfriend said he liked me, maybe he could provide some much needed attention. He had no idea about the other guys she was with, and the two of them got into an argument about it.


Now i'm confident that she hates me because I told him, I've been completely isolated since. She avoids me, refuses to talk to me, all the while being extremely close with a some new guy, who she actively brags about having sex with. Despite all of this I'm still her pet, and I don't know if I want to get out of the relationship either. It's really nice sometimes, and I dread the feeling of being alone. I'm afraid of leaving her.


I think that to her, being her pet isn't the same, or even close to being her boyfriend, and that makes it okay to leave me emotionally deprived, which isn't at all the case.

The Relationship


I started dating a wonderful girl my senior year of college. We had essentially been best friends for the 4 years prior, but finally admitted how much we felt for eachother right at the end. That led to a 5 year relationship that was nearly perfect for the first 4 years. 


The last year though life started to get in the way. I had begun to lose myself as a person and it led to a lot of mutual resentment as neither of us were putting in the effort to our relationship. I was working non stop hours, drinking too much and gambling addiction put my into a horrible financial situation. Through all of this she stood by me, though neither of us were happy.


The first years of our relationship were so care free and easy I took it for granted that communication was needed to make this thing last. She's horrible at communicating her feelings, so this made thing way worse as she was suffering inside but wouldn't tell me for fear of hurting my feelings. 


Despite all of this we still loved eachother to death. I had plans of asking her to move i with me and started for the first time to see marriage on the horizon.


But finally, my asshole ways caught up with me and after a massive fight I don't remember (blacked out) she ended things saying she needed to spend time making herself happy again. At this point I agree that she deserved to leave me, however it's her actions since then and the questions that I'm left with that I need the advice on.


Where I'm At Now

The breakup occured the last week of February, so at this point we've been broken up for nearly 5 months (wow). 


When she left I know she still very much loved me, so we still talked semi frequently. Trying to respect her wishes though I never pushed and would give her space until she reached out to me. After three weeks though I was dying and we got together and I apologized for over an hour for everything I had done or neglected to do for her. Throughout this conversation though, there was never any recognition of her actions in the process. (I may not have gone into a ton of detail on the the breakup, but she definitely wasn't innocent in letting the relationship die.) Additionally, she started talking about things she needed if we were to have lasted which I had plainly done for her most of our relationship. She's a dreamy type of girl and it started to become apparent that what she expected was essentially a Nicholas Sparks novel. 


A few more weeks past and in late May she started reaching out again. We saw eachother at a few friend's birthday parties and decided to get coffee together. While at coffee she let me know that she was moving to Boston for the summer to take summer courses she never finished. I was devastated as that felt like a deadline had been set for the end of whatever we had left. Throughout our conversation I made it clear that I still loved her though to respect her wishes and not let myself lose my pride I refrained from begging for her back and she left with me complete in tatters.


I'll spare you a bit and fast forward to the beginning of June when she's just about to leave. I ask if I can take her to dinner one last time. She said of course as I was essentially her only friend who seemed to care that she was leaving. At dinner we actually had a great time. For some reason I wasn't hurting and just able to enjoy our time together as we relived a ton of great memories. We got a bit tipsy and she asked if she could sleep over. Of course being completely weak and desperate for any chance to get her back I said yes. 


As we were going to bed we start cuddling and she makes it clear that we won't have sex. This is where things were said that leave me in the confused, hurt, lost and lonely place I am now. She tells me she can't have sex with me because she'd fall in love again and it would ruin her summer. She lets me know that she plans on going out with other guys while there and can't do that if she's thinking about me. I nearly puked when I heard that comment. The thought of her with anyone else made me sick to my stomach and has literally been haunting my dreams since.


BUT things get worse. she tells me she always figured that when she's back we could probably give it another shot but never wanted to say anything because she didn't want me waiting for her. Those two lines have been stuck in my head for two months since that night.


We spoke briefly when she got to Boston, but for the last month its been radio silence. She's told me that she wants to reach out all the time but is scared. Of what I'm not sure, but I do have a confident feeling that she's keeping tabs on me and were basically at a war of wills right not to see who will break first. I'm of the opinion that it's up to her to initiate contact and honestly when we talk its the happiest I can be, but then I sit there and spend the rest of the week thinking about who she's fucking instead of reaching out at all. These aren't necessarily tied issues, but there's definitely a correlation.


The Questions

Now that I've gotten all of that out of the way and you essentially know my life here are my questions.

1. How the hell do you get past the idea of them being with someone else. She's incredibly monogamous, so who knows she may not have been with anyone, but I can't keep the dark thoughts for creeping in nightly. I have come in and out of coming to terms with what may be, but it never seems to stick. How have others dealt with this.


2. I know Reddit is a big proponent of NC, and I do honestly understand it's value, but I truthfully miss her presence in my life. Additionally, she comes back in a month. And despite her coldly strategic approach before leaving I still love this girl to death. Am I wrong to want to reach out at some point before she heads back to my town. At this point I'm of the opinion that even if I do and it ends poorly the closure would be better than never knowing. I know NC is healing but its the nagging what if that I can't get past.


Sorry for this novel of incoherent emotions, but I've been holding back for so long and really can't refrain anymore. Even writing all of these jumbled questions and feelings out has been slightly therapeutic as I can now see how cold and tactical her actions have been since out breakup. Let me know any experiences you've had that can help guide me. I just want to know how to calm the ache in my heart and determine if I'm wrong to want to give it one last chance.

As I said in the title we've been together for 2.5 years and we've been living together for a year. 6 months ago we packed up our life and moved halfway across the country together after she got a new job. We were offset by a couple months but we worked through it.

However despite a new lifestyle and loads of new things to do I've ended up realizing that I'm not happy. I still love her but our personalities are so different that I just can't handle it anymore. About a month ago I realized that the only times I was really unhappy was when she was around. Not anything she did specifically but she's very tightly wound and high strung, and I'm about as laid back as you can be and still function.

Anyways I'm rambling. It would seem that she stresses out about everything no matter how small, and when she starts stressing like that it makes me stress out even more, and that leads me towards thoughts of depression.

So after finally coming to this realization I decided to call it off. Despite the fact that we both love each other I don't want to live my life being unhappy. Please let me know what your thoughts and reactions are to this.

Last week, the last week of school, I asked her out on a whim and she said yes. This was kind of exciting for me because it was the first time I asked anyone out.

I put most of the blame for that on the relationship, but after time apart and being on my own I kind of realised that I wasn't happy with myself.

Our relationship wasn't perfect though.  I would get bitchy and snappy with him, we didn't have sex very often, he was/is really introverted and we never talked about feelings or our future together. I was also getting frustrated with the lack of fun/spontenaeity in everyday life.

 I dated this girl for 10 months. We hardly ever argued, but we also would only be together once or twice a week. We were both studying really far away from each other, but we live relatively close.
 During these 10 months I would never give all I had to give because I was a bit afraid that what happened with my last relationship would happen again.. And she always told me it wasn't her fault, and that she was a new start, that I would have to let go of my fears of the past etc. 
Basically during the 10 months she always felt like she was loving and I was letting myself be loved. Which is kinda true.
 Fast forward to 3 weeks ago, she probably grew tired of the situation and told me she didn't knew if she loved me anymore (I was in internship and she was having her finals, which made us really distant). We broke up, and after the internship I kinda wanted to get back together and stuff, but she just wouldn't agree. 
Yesterday I went for a coffee with her to deliver some stuff that was left at my place, and after a 2 hour chat, she said she was confused. She started talking to this guy, 2 weeks after we broke up, but wasn't able to have anything with him. It was basically just chat and maybe some flirting. I didn't ask. But she insisted to be sincere with me. 
We spoke on the phone for 3 hours or so, and it was like nothing happened. Everything was fine, we felt comfortable with each other, we recalled memories together. It felt great. Although she did say that she was hurt by the fact that, the time that I better showed her that I loved her this much, was after the break up and not during the relationship. I do feel bad for that.
I just don't know if I should give it a shot because she already had doubts about what she felt towards me 3 weeks ago, and this chats with the mystery guy also don't help. Although I did fail during the relationship and I know it.

Background: 
My cousin is 25, lives at home, unemployed and out of education. He's an only child and he is spoilt rotten! He has no income and no life - he spends all day every day lounging around his home, sponging off his parents. He can be really kind and thoughtful... when it suits him, but mostly he's lazy and selfish and has a massive sense of entitlement. You cant ask him for a favour without him asking what its worth.

My aunt is generally nice and caring, always helping friends and family, but she can be really stubborn and incredibly touchy. she can have major sulks over the tiniest thing not to her liking.

My uncle (65M) is generally the peacekeeper between the other two but more often than not sides with his son, sneaks him money and enables his spoilt behaviour.

Current issues:
Since my aunts cancer diagnosis she has been even more stubborn and touchy. Making all sorts of plans to be out living life and then gets really upset when things go wrong or she's too ill to do something (cannot accept her new limitations). Instead of helping, my cousin just mocks her and blames her e.g you'd have more energy to clean the house if you weren't always out with friends and refusing to help cos she brings it upon herself. My uncle tries to stay out of it but will help out some, although when he does my aunt will often criticize him for doing it wrong or whatever. 

I'd love to help out more but I live 4 hours drive away, and even when I'm near by during holidays I cant help much as I have MS.

Ideally I'd like to give my cousin a piece of my mind and tell him to man up and help out, while telling my aunt to chill out and except help when its offered. But they're stupidly proud people and if I ever said anything confrontational they'd blow up and never talk to me again.

407,2c9fhi,"So about 3 years ago, I quit my job because it was too far to reach [I don't own a car and can't drive] and I suffered a serious injury which prevented me from working this job [it involved heavy lifting]. Since, I've been a freelancer.
I also co-run an entertainment website with my boyfriend. We were both producing content for it [we're  cartoonists/animators] but once I was injured, my boyfriend stopped working on his half, with the exception of writing and creative consulting. He said his fulltime job didn't allow him enough time to do more. It became mostly me and we struck a deal that I would do art/freelance at home, make a living on it while he paid the bills/food/etc. and eventually once I was pulling in enough money he can quit his job and join me.

Well, we struck this deal 3 years ago. Since then, the financial stress has really gotten to us. Freelancing is a bumpy road, sometimes you can make $2k in 1 month and not make anything for 6. I apply for 5-10 freelance jobs a day. It's tough to find work as a cartoonist/animator!

One minute he's yelling at me that there's no money, the next he wants me to focus on the business and produce content, but the business only makes us money if we go to conventions which I'm not allowed to attend alone because he's scared for my safety and they wear him out [Cons are typically Friday-Sunday, he loses his weekend] so we can't do them very often. I've offered to get a part time job at a supermarket or something just to make some money, but he dislikes how inconvenient that is [he works a full time job and if I work weekends, that prevents us from hanging out or doing things] that and he gives me the line: you're quitting your dream.

We were living with his family for awhile due to some issues with our last roommate [long story short: he pulled a gun out on us] and we were allowed to live there for free. We also stopped being intimate since his family didn't allow us much privacy. In May, my boyfriend decided it was time to move out, so we moved into an apartment [like just a month ago] Now everything feels different. He hides himself in our room to be left alone most of the time. He's off work at 6pm and in bed by 8 or 9, just to get up at 8am the next day for more work.

My current freelance jobs have become stagnant, my boyfriend and I have been even more stressed because money is even tighter now [I only made $275 in July and I've had to borrow business funds to pay off some bills. I still owe $1128 in bills], we have a comic book we have to finish by next week, and he's been mad at me because I'm not properly translating his scripts.  He's almost never around, how am I supposed to ask? If he didn't have a cellphone with text, I would never speak to him.

He recently told me he's got a lot of issues with us right now which he's keeping to himself because he knows it'll cause me to fall apart which will delay the book. He said he's waiting until it's done. So now I just feel this inevitable doom. Not sure if it's worth mentioning too, but last time I told him about a dream that he left me, he laughed about it, then told me he's kind of interested in our relationship being open, but because I don't want it OH WELL

We went to lunch together today and we ate in silence. He drove me back home and lectured/yelled at me me the whole time because of how I mistranslate his scripts, they're a waste of his time, he's mad at me, and such. I couldn't do much but listen. We're supposed to go to dinner with his family tonight, which I tried to pass on to work on the book, and he had this panic attack, thinking this was some sort of sign that this was the end of us.

She was in a 5-year relationship before we met, and was going through a breakup with said boyfriend when we met. He was emotionally abusive and controlling and she wanted out. We were friends for a few months and it turned into a friends with benefits/casual dating situation. After a while, I asked her to be my girlfriend and become exclusive. 

After a few weeks of being exclusive, she admitted to me that she had occasional sex with her ex-boyfriend while they still lived together during the transition from us being friends/dating to exclusive. She told me that once we had the exclusivity talk, and defined what we wanted in a relationship, she never had sex with him ever again. I believe this to be true. He harassed her to the point of her filing a restraining order against him after he found out we were together. She wanted absolutely nothing to do with him after we became exclusive.

None of this bothered me in the early stages, as I am a very open person sexually. However, as our relationship progressed and I fell in love with her, I began to feel two-timed and cheated during those early pre-exclusive months.

I buried these emotions for 2 years but now that we are engaged and I've had some time to think, it's hit me hard this past week and it's something I can't stop thinking about.

Except for her...anxiety, anger, general stress, I don't know.


95% of the time I can picture myself marrying her, but the other 5% makes me seriously think about how I can spend the rest of my life dealing with this. If she's driving and we're lost she starts a temper tantrum, and me offering to get directions or take over the driving is fixing the problem and unwanted. Ignore her telepathic glare when I'm talking to a friend for too long and she's sulking for the rest of the night, if not the next few days. See an insect at the other end of the room and she'll stop the conversation, and won't break eye contact with it until she's locked herself in a bathroom or someone kills it.

And if she perceives the smallest slight from a friend, coworker, her parents, whoever, she goes on a tirade against them when looking at it objectively and I can't even manage to wrap my head around why it's an issue in the first place. 


She's had a hard past, previous abusive relationship, potentially abusive (verbally) parents, clinically diagnosed depression &amp; anxiety disorders, so I can see why some of this odd behaviour comes up. But she refuses any sort of drug treatment, even those already prescribed to her by her doctor. Therapy helped, but she ran out of things to talk about and stopped going, now coincidentally things are ramping up again. I think what's affecting me most is that still through it all I'm the one who has to remain stoic and calm to counterbalance her emotions before we both spiral out of control. And after an outburst today, I'm thinking not only may I not be able to keep this up forever, but an outsider could easily see what happened as her being abusive. In the moment, 15 minutes later my refusal to escalate has slowed things down and she's fine; but trying to talk about long term solutions results afterwards leaves her in a guilt spiral about acting that way that's almost worse than the event that started everything. And hours later I'm nearly in tears trying to fall asleep next to her contemplating if that's what the rest of my life is going to be. 

I love her, she's been an amazing addition to my life, and I haven't met anyone as giving, supportive, and intelligent as her and I can't picture a relationship better than this in so many aspects. But at this point I'm honestly terrified to bring her out with my friends as I have no idea what she'll do, and I really, really need help dealing with this.

My girlfriend is severely depressed, and she's become very, very dependent on me as of late. It's really worrying, because it's gotten to the point where if I'm not there for her when she needs me, she gets extremely upset for the rest of the day, and often when I try to get to the bottom of the issue, she'll become angry at me for not being there. I don't mean angry in a violent way, but she'll just accuse me of being unable to support her when she needs me. The thing is, she *always* needs me.

An example; I sat with my friends instead of her at lunch today for the first time in weeks, maybe months. She told me to go ahead but I knew it was upsetting her. I went anyway a) because I'm actually losing my friends due to the fact that I'm always with my gf, and b) because I'm trying to get her to rely on me less, and lunch seems like a baby step, right?

It ruined her entire day. We were skyping later, I left to take a shower and I forgot to call her back afterward. Now, because of the lunch incident and the skype incident, she told me I haven't been here all goddamn day.

I just don't know what to do. It seems like every time I do the subtlest thing that would require her own independence, she gets overly emotional about it. The worst part is, I've tried to confront her about it. I want to work through this, I really really don't want to break up with her. But thanks to some troubles we had a few months ago, every time I try to confront her she gets terrified that I'll break up with her, and as a result she says anything and everything she can to ensure I won't break up with her. I can't have a real conversation about these issues because she's too scared to bring up what's on her mind, because she thinks that I'll just end things.

489,39g2tj,"We have 3 major issues. **Feel free to skip to the TL;DR because the background is actually not super important for the main issue,** but it's really nice to lay it out like this for me.

**(1) When she is stressed, she takes it out on me.** She'll be stressed, I'll EITHER vaguely comfort her or try to offer a solution, it doesn't matter, she'll bark back at me and claim that I don't care, wow that's not helpful at all, if you don't want to bother with me that's fine and doesn't see this as *taking it out on me* nor as *passive aggressive*. I confronted her about how she reacts just fine to other people, and she said it's because other people don't act the way I do (i.e. it's my fault), which has gotten worse and worse because now when she's stressed I am instantly tense and uncomfortable, anticipating some insults which lead to a fight, which she takes as evidence I don't care. **My perspective:** Why would you treat your partner that way? Of course I'm not going to continue being helpful/comforting if you bite my head off for it? **Her perspective:** She can't get the support she needs when she's stressed, and I need to just stop being so sensitive when she's bitchy towards me because that's just how she is when she's stressed.

**(2) Sex.** Despite many actually very healthy and thorough communication about sex, talking hasn't solved anything. Our first talks about it [2.5 years ago] were maybe not-so-healthy, but over the recent past 6 months we've really discussed it in depth with each other. We have sex probably twice a month and it happens when she announces we should go to bed early tonight, so we go about our days, I feel immense pressure to be ready for the evening, then I only find out immediately before bed if she's too tired, too stressed, doesn't want to, maybe tomorrow (spoiler: it's never tomorrow). I did used to come onto her - I mean, I *exclusively* initiated with a few exceptions - but at least at first she was very detectably receptive. She started rejecting me more and more over time so at this point I don't even bother and in fact I'm not sure I even remember how to. It was a first serious relationship for both of us so I thought our initial sexual timidness would naturally evaporate as we explored and experimented, but it turns out she was full of shit when she'd agree with me about that. Right from the start we had what I thought were honest conversations about our expectations, hopes, desires, etc (with sex and other things) and I've slowly found out more and more that she either lied or just doesn't know herself at all, and would just agree for the sake of agreeing. Now, I think she's gone down on me a total of 5 times ever, and she has NO enthusiasm or 'spark' during sex. We have so little sexual chemistry that at this point I'm not even attracted to her anymore, and don't even want sex with her; sex with her is stressful and unsatisfying, she's so particular and so negative, she doesn't make me feel desired at all (not a self-esteem issue on my part, I'm aware I'm quite attractive). I see her like a roommate or a sister and feel like I'm some dirty pervert (not in a good way) when I try to come onto her. I don't think it's wrong for her to have a lower sex drive but she's either lying to me or lying to herself about it, claiming it is just some performance anxiety she needs to work through, when I am fairly convinced by now that she's just not that into sex. She doesn't watch or read porn despite my encouraging her, she has no fantasies, she has no idea what turns her on, she's embarrassed by any kind of raunchiness or dirtiness. She'll masturbate if I'm away for a while but not if I'm in town (we live together).

**(3) Alone-time.** She is very clingy. Although I come across very outgoing irl, I am actually a huge introvert. She won't even get groceries alone. We work in the same complex and often [but not always] see each other for lunch, hang out with friends together after work, get groceries, make dinner, eat dinner, watch shows, watch movies together. But god forbid I go on my cellphone for like 15 min when we're hanging out. Lately I have been more blatantly enforcing that I need some alone-time, like a few hours *A WEEK!* and she SAYS this is fine but *it's not fine*. She takes MAJOR issue with it at unexpected intervals. I, again, had a serious talk with her about this recently because it was getting fucking ridiculous and it came out that she doesn't consider any of the activities I mentioned to be us time. They are closer to being apart time than us time for her. I mean - I get it if someone wants a one-on-one date-night in addition to chilling with friends &amp; casually spending time one-on-one watching tv. But that's not what she's saying, it's so much more than that. I told her frankly that I was completely baffled by that &amp; that this is just how I am, I need space, and I've told her that since the beginning -- yet another thing she agreed with me in the early days that turned out to just be completely, blatantly, *hilariously* false. She's always expressed basically undying love and that she doesn't know what she'd do without me, but on this one issue she did say  something about how she'll have to consider whether this is something she can be happy with in a relationship. One of the big things that made me really realize *we should break up* is that I got excited when she said this; I realize I have not been fearing breaking up, but rather fearing *being the one to make the decision* as I worry about (a) hurting her and (b) regretting it.

-----

**The current problem.** We do have good times together. She is my best friend. I mourn the idea of losing our friendship and I worry about being lonely. So when I'm away from her I become aware how fucked-up the situation is and wonder why I'm still doing it, but when I'm with her it all evaporates, I feel happy and comfortable and loved (until we fight which is often), and I also become more convinced it's my fault and that if I just work on things it will get better. 

**So now she is away for a few months, but will be back for a single week in the middle of it. We live together btw.** The location is so remote that there is no cellular service. We can **only** communicate VIA instant message online in the evenings when she is done work for the day. Removed from the *positives* of being around her, it seems so plain and stark that working on this is absolutely fucking ridiculous. Because we've had very serious talks about the sex issue possibly ending our relationship, she expressed concern that I'd decide while she was away that I wanted to break up. She's literally been gone less than a week and her fear has come true. I feel so much happier, freer, less stressed, and more like myself now that she is away.

My closest friends have expressed that they are worried about how unhappy she makes me, that I seem less like myself, that she is abrasive and rude towards me and that she is convincing me to blame myself about it, that I'd be so much happier if we split up and that they'd be there for me. I personally wish I could just break up with her via our only communication avenue, which is online instant messaging, but I know she'd be so furious about that, and I'd feel bad about myself because people seem to generally agree that's a cruel thing to do (I don't get the big deal personally but I can accept that most people do).

I don't live in the US and going on dates here isn't really what people our age do, it's kind of taboo i guess but well I've been asking for a couple of weeks to go to a party together and this is the first time she can.

1119,23zhpn,"Now, before you assume anything, this isn't what it looks like. I've asked him to think about breaking up with me. 

I'm struggling with two serious mental illnesses (mood disorders, nothing psychotic) and I'm not fully stabilized yet. I was making progress, but something changed and I've been in a downward spiral lately and I've been acting really ugly. 

Throughout my relationship with my boyfriend, I've been very dependent on him and we have both had bouts of being emotionally abusive to one another. For a long time, the good outweighed the bad by a lot. 

Things have been bad lately though. Worse than ever. We've been having problems for the past month or so and I have been under a tremendous amount of stress stemming from various areas of my life - as has he. 

However, he got to go on a week-long cruise recently and forget about his worries while I stayed up in cold, dreary NJ busting my ass in college. I had exams, my computer broke, certain people became very nasty to me, and my best friend was in a mental institution. Meanwhile, he was eating like a king, suntanning, getting drunk every night, winning money in the casino, and even riding dolphins. 

I'm not going to lie, I resented him for it. It wasn't fair of me, but I resented him for getting to do all of that and forget about his worries while I fell under even more stress. I was really lonely while he was gone too. 

When he returned, he was all smiles, great to be around, and full of stories from his cruise. I wanted to use his positive energy to be happier and not let the resentment get the best of me. I tried. I tried so fucking hard... but my emotional control is absolute shit right now. 

The second day he slept over at my dorm, the resentment won out and an ugly side of me came out that I have never seen before. 

I was in a funk and felt distress from the internal conflict I was suppressing. I didn't feel right, almost didn't feel like I was there. I wanted to go do something to get my mind off of things, but he wanted to stay and play on the computer. So I let it go and tried to take a nap, but my mind was going at 1000 mph and I couldn't fall asleep. 

I started talking and talking. I was saying things as I thought them and using no filter at all. I don't remember what I said - just that I was talking. Apparently I carelessly made quite a few comments that really took a blow to his ego. 

If that wasn't enough, I got sexually abusive, which has NEVER happened before. I wanted sex and he didn't. After a little bit of teasing, he told me he wouldn't mind a bj, so I obliged... And after a few minutes, I asked him if we could take it a step further and he said no. I kept pushing though and called him selfish for not letting me get something out of it too. When I realized he wasn't going to budge, I used guilt tactics and made him feel bad for not wanting penetrative sex with me. I even told him I've been feeling sexually dissatisfied because he hadn't given me an orgasm in a while...

He asked me what the fuck I was doing and he seemed pretty hurt. A flip switched in my brain. Holy fuck. I just did that. I apologized profusely, but I knew nothing I said would be enough. 

We went to bed a little while later and the next day was awkward as hell. Something in the air was different all the way from there until I dropped him off at his house. 

Fear not though, I'm not a complete asshole. 

I just got off the phone with him. We had a serious conversation about what happened. He tried to tell me it was ok, but I wouldn't accept that. After a little while, I told him that my behavior has been unacceptable and has inflicted damage to him... I even asked him why he puts up with all of this from me. He said its because he loves me. 

I got through to him though. I told him that the feeling of love alone isn't enough to stay in a bad relationship. I told him I know breaking up would hurt, but that staying in an abusive relationship is worse in the long-run and that I would know from experience... and I asked him to think about only himself this time. 

I'm giving him space right now while he reconsiders our relationship. I told him I won't contact him unless there's an emergency. I don't know when I'll hear from him again. He just said he'll talk to me when he's ready to. 

I know I did the right thing here and its because I love him enough to let him go. I'm so fucking scared though. I don't want to live without him. I don't want to watch all of our plans and dreams dissipate. I'm ok with being alone, but the idea of not having him in my life anymore is unbearable. 

There's a very high chance he will take me up on my offer and I won't stop him if he does....

To start, I have been dating my girlfriend for a little over 3.5 years.

She makes me happier than anyone else I've ever met.


There's this other girl, who I've known for 4-5 years since university. She's my best friend. When I first met her I was single and thought she was really hot but nothing ever happened and we ended up just being really close friends. This continued even after I started dating my gf. The two of them are friends, and my gf knows I will often take this other girl out for drinks and partying cuz we're friends and we've kept it purely platonic.

I've recently been in love with this girl who I've know since High School. We didn't really talk to each other back then but we had similar friends so we would see each other now and then. I live about an hour away from her now that I'm in college, but I was in town to visit my parents when I met her in the mall. we have been texting almost every day since then and had a coffee date and had a great time. She said afterwards that the next time we meet, we should go out in the club. 

So far so good right?

I proposed that she should come to my city and go out there and she agreed that it sounded like fun. She had a soccer match the next day though, so she didn't want to go to bed very late, so she asked if she could sleep in my dorm room so she didn't have to travel back late at night.
We still texted and talked how excited we were to go out together.

Sound great right?

Well, when she arrived I cooked her some dinner, we had a few beers and generally had a good time, but there were a few awkward silences.. We went out soon afterwards and I met some friends who joined us in our clubbing adventure. 

Now this is what frustrates me.. Inside, she wouldn't even look at me. When I tried dancing with her, she would just ignore me and go her own way. She happily danced with my friends though, but it felt like I just didn't weren't there.

At about 03:00 PM, we went back home and she basically fell asleep after making some small talk and the morning after, she told me how sweet I was for cooking her diner and that she had a great time today. Then she took the train home..

I am just confused? We really hid it off. If she didn't like me, why did she come all the way to my city to go out with me? Does she just see me as a friend and wanted a good time? Are my dance moves just terrible? I just need some advice on what her mindset is and what to do from here, because I really like this girl and just don't understand her mindset right now.

I bring this up occasionally, along the lines of, I feel bad that I'm always telling you about my problems and I don't give you a chance to listen to yours. He tells me talking about my problems don't make me feel better and the things I'm going through are the things you  just wouldn't get, because you lived a sheltered and fortunate upbringing.

Me and my high school ex girlfriend have more or less had an on and off open relationship since we broke up 3 years ago. We started dating in our first year of high school and were each others first real relationship, first sexual partners, and truly our first loves. We broke up in Grade 12 because I wanted to have the freedom that year that I didn't have all of high school and we were most likely going our separate ways once University hit. I took the break up a lot better than she did and probably 3 months later she convinced me to start sleeping with her again. We did this until University started and have since then consistently done it on school breaks up until this point. At the beginning for me it was more just a sexual thing for me, we didn't spend too much time hanging out after or talking, it was just kinda sex. I know it was more to her though. We both had small flings with other people after we broke up and throughout university (i was a bit more promiscuous) but nothing ever stuck for either of us. As time went on I  felt myself growing closer to her again however and developing some feelings. 

Fast forward to October last year. I sustained a bad concussion in football and stayed home second semester. I developed some depression and anxiety. I was out of routine and at home working a shitty job and it sucked. I was not too stoked on life. However I think the whole experience put a lot of things into perspective. It kind of made me chill out a little bit and calm down my partying lifestyle. It made me start realizing what was more important in life than a big social circle; family, friends, health, love , my passions. I started thinking about my ex a lot. We had always been so good together. Our relationship was always so solid. We were so in love and I know for both of us this had never really left. We broke up simply because I was getting bored. She was more or less a perfect girlfriend and that was literally the only justification for our ending our relationship. We could never seem to keep our hands off each other and I think  that was simply because our chemistry was so damn good and we still really cared about each other a lot deep down. Nothing ever came between us and gave us a reason to stop being involved. One night when I was at home she texted me checking in with me and told me she missed me. We ended up talking on the phone that night and I came forward with some of the feelings. I told her I often think of being with her again. She said she did too but wasn't sure if I was just saying this because I was vulnerable and needed someone at the time. This may or may not have been true, I still don't really know. The conversation more or less ended well without anything being decided.

She came home from school for the summer and we started hanging out a lot. We would hang on a weekly basis, talk, cuddle, and have sex. It was really nice. Again the chemistry is undeniable. Nothing seems more natural then when we are together and she is the only people I feel comfortable telling my problems and things of that nature to. She never did anything with a single other guy that whole summer and I had two small hook ups with other girls. These did nothing for me. I didn't feel accomplished at all in them and she had no idea they happened. I think she was the only one for me, other girls didn't seem to matter. The summer ended and we went our separate ways again. I was excited to go back to school again and thought I'd be hitting it off with girls left right and centre. It didn't go that way.

At school I developed some anxiety again, I think just due to being back in a new setting and out of my element. I only got with one girl and didn't have much success with anyone else. I don't know if it was my anxiety or that I still just wanted my ex. One weekend I had a chiro appointment in her city (its 2 hours from my school) and she practically begged me to stay with her so i did. We were both super excited to spend the weekend together. When I got there it was great. We wandered the city, went out for dinners and lunches, and stayed with each other that night. I felt like I was on cloud nine. It was like we were dating again. On the morning I left over lunch I came forward with my feelings. I told her I still have strong feelings for her and again think about dating her again a lot. I told her that I couldn't do the in between thing anymore and either wanted to give it another shot or end what we were doing. She said she agreed somewhat but she wasn't ready to settle down at that point. She wasn't on the same level as me and wondered if I was just wanting it because it was so easy and comfortable for us. She kind of shut me down and I left feeling really upset. I told her I needed time to get over her and I deleted her off social media and didn't talk to her for a month and a half. 

Last week I was going to her city to stay with some buddies and party there for the weekend. I did not have any intentions of seeing her or even letting her know I was in town. The night before I left she drunk texted me saying she missed me. I didn't reply and left on the Friday. That night I got drunk a tried to call her late that night. She was asleep but we got to talking in the morning; i told her I was in town and she told me she missed me a lot and told me to come over later that night. Me being me (drunk at the time) agreed. After our night on the town I went to her house and had sex with her. Again it was so natural and not weird in the morning. We had breakfast and it was great. I did the same thing the following night. Its like we were dating the way we were interacting those two days. I left feeling really really good about it all. She seemed more into us than before and I felt kind of neutral about it all. I didn't really care.

A week later and here I am. We've talked during the week and she's said things like she was thinking about me a lot and she missed me/missed talking to me when we weren't talking, to which I agreed. I'm so confused by it all now. I don't know if she wants me again, missed just talking to me as a friend, etc. I don't know what her deal is. I don't know what my deal is either. I'm struggling to figure out if I really still want to be with her or that is my anxiety and inability to find another girl talking. Its so confusing. Right now I'm contemplating on either completely moving on from her again and cutting off communication from her, calling her right now and asking what her feelings are and telling her mine, or waiting till we are home in december for xmas and talking to her face to face then. Its confusing I know reddit but please try to give me some outsider opinions.

Like the title says, this morning my husband and I were having sex, when he abruptly grunted and announced he had finished. (We have a great sex life, or so I thought). Seeing as we use no physical protection (I'm on BCP's), and as I ALWAYS immediately clean up after sex, I immediately noticed that there was absolutely nothing to clean up. (Usually, and not to be crude, but there is A LOT.)

I asked him about it, jokingly asking if he'd faked it, he made light of it saying there must have been less because we just had sex the evening before.

This made no sense to me, but whatever. 

He eventually admitted that he'd faked it and that it was because he thought it would hurt my feelings if he'd simply said he couldn't ejaculate at that moment in time. 

I'm not hurt that he couldn't ejaculate, but do admit to feelings of insecurity, as I have gained some weight lately. I AM hurt that he so easily and readily lied to me about it.

What should I do, and WHY do I feel so shitty?!

Naturally we are closer to the person of the same sex, but before we all collectively became friends I was pretty close with the other girl; in fact when my GF and I broke up on a two different occasions the other girl helped me through it. I say helped because she mainly just lent me a listening ear.

 Anyway when my GF and I got back together most recently (last September) she was very upset with how close I was with this girl while we were apart. I told her not to be blah, blah, blah. Eventually, we worked through it and I am no longer as close with the other girl, but deep down inside I know she has, or had, feelings for me at some point in our friendship even though I would 1) never want to be with anyone other than my current GF and 2) never consider her as a potential partner because I am not attracted to her and think she is a bad GF to her current BF whom I'm friends with.

We had one stint where we broke up for a couple months and during that span she posted a picture on Facebook with some guy she's friends with. She told me the story about how they went to watch a soccer game at some bar, he had a couple drinks and tried confessing his love for her which is apparently a normal occurrence. She said they only ever hang out when they're both single (red flag to me) but says she has zero attraction towards him and has told him numerous times that it isn't happening. They've been friends for a pretty decent amount of time (a few years at least). They haven't hung out since then (about a year ago) and things have been good. 

Now they go the the same gym. This is gonna get pretty stalkerish so don't judge as you've been warned. I noticed that he's always at the top of her friends list on Facebook so I looked at his page.

I really care about her, I love who she is on many levels but she is very religious and feels that movies with nudity in them are unnecessary and that it's not wholesome. I have tried to become active again in religion (It's been tough) but I am trying. I have given up partying for her and now there's this dilemma.

I am torn. I love movies. She knows that but she is anti-nudity. I'm totally fine with no porn, but I wanted to see the new Seth Rogen movie 'Neighbors' and she balked about it when she looked up its content on IMDB. She's fine with R rated movies unless there's nudity.

I feel like she is being completely unrealistic. She is also anti-Snapchat and said if we were to get married I should delete it. I only Snap good friends, I'm loyal, the works.

She actually called a break today, so I can see what I really want. I want to date her, but I also want to be myself and come to some sort of compromise. I personally question her self-esteem but she claims that's not it, she just wants wholesome media in the relationship.

580,2it4uq,"I am an American attending a public high school in the U.S. I am a senior/Grade 12, and the person in question is the same.

I never had much luck with girls. Social anxiety. Fearful of pursuing, much less committing to a relationship.. that sort of thing.

I recently dropped out of my AP Environmental Science class, into an Advanced Art class. I was surprised to find that one girl I opted to sit next to start talking to me, and we have really hit it off together. I have known her since freshman year, but we had never spoken to one another before now. She is fun and outgoing, and I really enjoy her outlook on life. We have talked to each other daily for the past couple of weeks. She often specifically targets me for conversing with. A pleasant change from my previous experiences with girls and people in general...

Both of us have similar interests, from what I've seen, and it is very nice to have her as a friend, if nothing else. 

But I am quite attracted to her romantically. And for the first time in my life, I think she could be too.

I'm probably going to sound naïve, but I really have no experience with girls. At all. So here's what I've noticed:


She has moved from sitting across the table from me, to sitting on the end, right next to me. I'll show a visual example in the comments section.


She seems genuinely interested in everything I have to say. Laughing, eye contact etc.


Frequently compliments me on my art


Invited me to go with her to go to the tracing room (projector for preliminary of tracing large, complex pieces of art) while she worked on a new project. It is secluded and quiet. We had a great, long conversation about various travel/culture related things (both of us happen to be seasoned world travelers).

Now I'm a fairly attractive guy. Probably a 7.5/10, being modest, and for what it's worth r/amiugly critiqued me very positively. I also would like to think of myself as being kind, sweet, and generous. My problem is that I can often come off as being a loner-by-choice when I meet new people, but that is not the intent. The social anxiety just kills me...

I would love to pursue dating her. But I am so afraid. I have never done anything like this. How certain do I have to be that she is interested before I go for it? What's the difference between being too involved in her life, and not being involved enough? So many questions.

Any tips or general advice based on what I've shared with you? What do you think the chances are that she could be interested in me?

523,1sls4f,"I'll go about the story in chronological order. There's a TL:DR for the backstory and the recent events.

---Back Story---

I met this girl in grade 7. She liked me on and off and so did I (but we never admitted it) until finally, the month of December in 2012, I tell her that I like her. At this point we're best friends, and things take off from there. 


Fast forward to January and I ask her out. One month later, I'm completely in love with this girl. I lose my virginity to her and everything is mostly going well. Almost perfect chemistry,  and I'd do anything for her. She does however have a few problems with self-esteem and when we first had sex, I couldn't finish and she cried because she thought it was her fault. I wasn't upset though, it didn't bother me, I just liked to be with her.


This self-esteem problem she blamed on her ex-boyfriend who had cheated on her. She didn't fully believe that men were capable of loving the same way women would and I was determined to prove to her otherwise. She was horribly afraid that I would eventually succumb to temptation of other women.


Other than her insecurities, things continue going well until this summer; I left for Phuket to see my Dad. One night, in Phuket, I met up with my buddy Sean who also happened to be there, and we went out clubbing. Basically, three different girls tried to approach me that night; and I shot all of them down. I even shot down the girl who just wanted to talk to me. By the end of the night, i'm completely wasted and have blown all my money on liquor so we head home. I hadn't danced, I honestly just sat there the whole night and drank.


We get home- and I go straight to skype to tell this girl what had happened and that I turned down every girl. She was a little upset but was thankful I did the right thing. From that night on though, she kept bringing it up and saying she felt insecure.


A month passes and I return home to Canada, I see her and all is well-  we just have fun. 


But soon, we start to argue a lot more... suddenly, we're getting mad at each other over nothing. College starts. I commute about 2 hours a day just to get to college. There are colleges much closer but I chose that one because she goes there and I wanted to spend more time with her, as I had moved downtown that summer.


Eventually, after a lot of arguing, we go on a break that lasts literally a day. And we get back together and try again. And then we go on another break that lasts something like 3 or 4 days. And we tried again. And then we broke up (this was a little over two months ago). Our reasoning is that she needed time to work on herself, so she could improve her self-esteem. And I could work on the same, as I have similar (but not as extreme) problems. But then we got back together. We were just enjoying time together too much not to. 


That didn't last long though, we finally broke up for the last time. (Two months ago). 


**TL:DR; Met nice girl in grade 7, ended up dating in grade 11. Everything is great other than insecurities she has. Then I go to Thailand, and her insecurities get worse. Finally I get back, and we end up arguing a lot, going on a break, then ending it in order to focus on ourselves.**


---Recent---


And in an effort to not get back together, I pushed her away. I developed a small rebound crush on a pretty girl in my math class that I never acted on, as I didn't have the balls. Also, in the back of my mind, I knew it was a stupid crush, and I eventually got over that rebound crush.


At this point, the girl is trying hard to get over me. But we had a relapse (a month ago and a week) and we fooled around a bit. Afterwards, I promised to her I wouldn't date anyone for at least a month, and she did the same, and we didn't see each other for two weeks after that. Not in the hallways, and we barely talked- again I pushed her away, but for no reason. And I stopped trying to push her away at the end of these two weeks.


By this time, she was getting better- she had been able to start focusing on herself, and my hope in the future of our relationship was on the rise. But a week ago, she began to push me away. I had no idea why; she was telling me because she didn't want a relationship for the moment, that she was happy being single, so that's what I thought. She said she was feeling much better about herself. But this weekend, I found out it's actually because she likes another guy. I was devastated and could barely stand as I thought we might actually be together by new year.


Yesterday, I found out not only does she like this guy, but they've been seeing each other. I don't know all the details (although the masochist in me wants to know), all I know is they kiss and hold hands and stuff.


I felt sick- I couldn't think straight and had to get out of a math test as I couldn't do basic arithmetic. I've been experiencing these horrible ups and downs. Sometimes I can find escape with friends, or with videos, but the rest of the time i'm either angry or hoping I'll die in my sleep. 


And she cares about me. In fact, she *likes* me but she just doesn't think it'll ever work out. Maybe she's right. We did try again and again often but the issue was never actually fixed like it supposedly is now; her self-esteem. I'm not an option to her. She didn't want to like this guy, apparently it *just happen.*


She tells me she feels guilty and conflicted because she feels like her ex-boyfriend and that she knows everything she wants will just make me unhappy.


Right now, I know she is with him. We were having a serious text and it stopped. Completely dead on FB, Twitter, text... unusual for her, and for him. It's pretty late so he must be at her house or vice versa. I want to die when I imagine her with him. Or with anyone. The girl I still love, holding another guy, cuddling with him. 


I don't know what to do. I can't ignore her- I always just end up texting her a few hours/days after telling her I can't be her friend anymore and to be honest, that's not very fair for her either- she really wants to be friends.


**TL:DR: After breakup, work on self- get better. She says she is happy single though, so she doesn't want a relationship right NOW. Week later, discover she likes a guy, yesterday discover she is dating him.**


What the fuck. I'm sorry- that was long, and I'd be surprised if I get any answer at all. I don't really have friends to talk to so I have a lot on my chest and I just don't know what to do.


EDIT: I'd like to add that this would not be as serious if this girl was not always so nice and understanding with me- it's hard to emphasize that every step of the way, she has been nice, and has never lied. She is honestly incapable of lying- she tried once over nothing and broke down in tears with guilt. We've talked about a future, and assumed we'd be together for a long time and I believed it right till the end. Part of me still believes we might get back together later and continue for the rest of our lives happy, but i'm starting to doubt that. I'm a little young, I know, I know- but she's my best friend..

993,2o4lx8,"Long story short: I've been friends with Jon (not his real name) for about a year. We've had feelings for each other for about as long, but only acted on them a couple months ago, and so far things are going really well. We are dating exclusively but are not Facebook official or anything (we're both fairly private people), although our mutual friends are all aware that we're together and we don't shy away from it. So that's good. Everything is going really well.

That said, back in the spring, Jon booked a vacation with a few of his other single guy friends to a music festival outside of the country. That particular group of friends are, to use his terminology, kind of a bunch of dirtbags. (They've all been friends since high school and I get the sense that they're still together out of inertia more than anything else.) They do a lot of drugs, which Jon says he isn't into anymore (he had a dirtbag period of his own but from what I've seen, he's pretty much over it) and try to hook up with random women and basically do the whole dudebro thing with varying degrees of success. Imagine four variations on the Zach Galifianakis character from The Hangover, plus a fairly normal regular guy. That's pretty much the dynamic. However, he admits that he's a pretty suggestible person and often does stuff he's not really thrilled about because his friends are doing it - mostly just occasional party drugs, drinking too much, that kind of thing, but I'm not sure what all else that entails.

Anyway, Jon and I weren't together when he booked the vacation, which he says he regrets spending the money on at this point, and we've only been dating for a couple months, so I don't have a lot of room to lay down ground rules for what I would and wouldn't want him to do. I don't *want* to be That Girl who nags and tells the guy not to have any fun. But he's going to be in a position where he's surrounded by guys who are all id and no superego, and he's easily the best-looking and most normal part of that crew, making him by far the most appealing prospect. I've screwed up relationships in the past by being the Cool Girl and not asserting myself until it was too late, but I really like this guy and I don't want to make myself out to be the Crazy Girl yet, either. Is this discomfort that I'm feeling normal, and how do I deal with it?

My girlfriend is a nice girl and she loves me, but she fights too much, she's always not happy with something, I try my best but she always starts a fight out of nothing and I've been dealing with this issue for several months and I'm already pissed off. Lately I can't stand her and I've told her, she wants me to be patient and she claims that she will improve if I give her more stability and stuff.

In my opinion I think she can't change, fighting and making troubles is the way she is, she simply can't change.

We both have some shit to sort out so aren't in any hurry to make our already complicated lives more complicated, but we love and want each other. I'm completely in love with her and want more from the relationship, and until recently she's been quite enthusiastic as well. Lately she's been pushing me away a bit, treating me more like just a friend. This started after we began having more serious conversations about long-term plans and options for us.

She had another relationship about a year ago which got serious but when they got to discussions of commitment he ran away. This hurt her a lot, and she's saying that the reason for her being more distant with me now is that she doesn't want to get hurt again, and we should just slow things down and sort out our lives first. She's not saying we're done, just that she's scared. I've done lots of things to take the pressure out of the relationship and am not being needy, but I'm scared too, scared of losing her. I'm patient, but I don't want her to drift away. She is the best thing to ever happen to me, and makes me feel alive. The heartbreak of losing her would rock my world, and I don't know that I'd ever come back from it. Yes it's that serious.

* She's really just scared, like she says she is, and actually feels strongly for me too. If I leave her alone for a while, she'll be back.

* She doesn't feel strongly for me and is trying to let me down easy

* She is angry about the earlier relationship and wants (maybe subconsciously) to hurt someone else in the same way she was hurt before
 
* She is just testing the power dynamics in the relationship by playing a scarcity game

* She has self-esteem issues and can't believe that something as good as us can happen to her

Her and I are now more or less on a break.  I tried to break it off, and I think I almost did... but watching the realization and the pain in her was just too too much.  I couldn't keep it together, I cried my face off (which I don't think has happened in 20 years).  I couldn't leave her alone in the room, so I stayed and left in the morning with things unresolved.

As far as she was concerned I was 100% the one for her.  I feel like I'm literally ruining someone utterly and completely.  Long story short, we're not officially separated.  I agreed to see a therapist (on my own) to work through a lot of my own problems with anxiety and general unhappiness (I don't know if I would qualify myself as someone suffering from depression just yet).

Not to sound arrogant, but from her perspective I think I'm like the dream catch she was pretty sure she wouldn't find before 3 years ago.  I improve her life in so many ways, mentally, emotionally, financially, supportively etc. etc.  I think I might also be the most attractive man she has had a real relationship with (again, not trying to sound arrogant, I guess it's just important for me to explain how dependent and attached to me she is)

I'm a coward, I know people will say I'm causing pain by possibly prolonging things... but the distress I would cause in her by truly living is so monumental I feel physically ill.  I'm at a point now where I'm forgetting to eat throughout the day.  Is the pain and fear a sign that I do actually love her?  Deep down I feel skeptical of that.

In regards to her ultimatum about engagement from the last thread I posted, she has completely and utterly backed off.  I totally stood my ground on the subject and I think when she realized her manipulative tactic wasn't going to work she found herself at a complete loss.  Now she's on to saying we don't have to ever get married, but don't leave her, I can have all the space I want, etc. etc.  I told her she deserved someone who was ready for things to progress after 3 years, basically turned everything she had already said around and told her I agreed with her.  And now she suddenly doesn't care about any of that.  Which makes things that much harder, the fact that she wants nothing more than to just be with me regardless - I had hoped she would express more resentment and anger toward me so that there was at least some mutual feelings that it might be the right thing to separate - even if there was a tiny silver lining for her... but alas she doesn't see it that way.

I think I more or less know the sort of responses I'll get here (Man up etc.)  But I felt the need to type this out regardless.  Thank you.

Ok so I deleted the original post but I will copy and paste it here... And then explain my current dilemma after!
I am so angry and worked up right now!! And I probably don't need to be but I just can't help it anymore!! I love my boyfriend to pieces. We have a great relationship. We have had one arguement in our 3 years together which happened in October. And I think his mum has held a grudge since, but if course to save face to her wonderful family she has been talked into speaking to me again (even though me and my boyfriend were both in the wrong but hey... I just let it slide for the sake of a quiet life) 

Christmas is awkward for us, we live bang in the middle of both our parents , about a 3 hour drive from each. I'm a nurse and usually work christmas, so he goes to his mothers. Meaning it's a rush around the week before to get presents delivered etc. So tonight, we are heading up to my parents to deliver presents and see them for the day tomorrow. I'm busy until 10.30pm and then we are driving up the road to my parents so we can make the most if the next day with them. My boyfriends mum phones en route and goes into loudspeaker as usual... Asks how far we've got and why she can't see him moving on glympse (stupid tracking app) (and what's it got to do with her anyway we are going to my parents, not hers). She then, out of the blue, goes off on one about how stupid it is to be driving at night this late and then starts attacking me, saying everything with that fucking girl is mental/ stupid etc. 

Obviously forgetting that I was also in the car. And that I didn't actually force her son to drive, he has a mind of his own. I bit my tongue and said nothing, my BF hung up the phone. I tried so hard but I sent her a text to say thanks I know how your really feel now blah ah. 

I'm so angry. But I'm more worried. My boyfriend and his mum are so close, how can we have a relationship if I'm but speaking to her?! I don't know what to do! Help! tl;dr boyfriends mum bitches on loudspeaker about me because she is a horrible cow.

And then she POINT BLANK fucking denied ever saying what she said. We argued on the phone with her but eventually gave up.
I have no idea what to do. I certainly won't be speaking to her unless she decides she's not a crazy person and apologises. I have christmas gifts from her, do I send them back? Do I just leave them? Do I open them and say thank you? I have no idea how to move on from this and I would hate for it to come between me and my boyfriend.

Let me start this off by saying we have a child together so No Contact isn't really an option.

Some background:


 We have been in an on again off again relationship for 4 years now. My GF (let's call her Maria) and I started off our relationship very quickly. Out of nowhere two weeks into us being together she randomly stops talking to me. Won't answer calls, won't answer texts. Blocked me on all the social media. Goes completely dark. This lasts about a week, and just as I'm starting to let go of it and chalk it up to unexplainable nonsense she calls me. Tells me she's been ignoring me because she's only known me for a short while and already has strong feelings for me so she got scared. Told me she didn't want to be hurt and ran away because she was afraid of how fast and hard she fell for me. She apologizes and I accept. 


 Roughly a month later she tells me the truth, told me that she actually stopped talking to me because she was trying to make another attempt of making things work with her ex, she said that ultimately she couldn't because she felt bad for what she did to me and realized that her feelings for me were stronger than she thought. Said that the whole time she was trying to make it work with him all she could think about was me. Called it quits and called me back. I was very upset but ultimately I forgave her since i figured it was already in the past and she was actually coming clean and telling me the truth on her own initiative.


  Within 3 months we were living together. About a few months after we moved into our apartment we got pregnant. We couldn't afford our apartment so we moved to my Mothers house for the time being as the due date got closer. This is where the on again off again really started. We have broken up maybe 4 or 5 times since our daughter was born. The past two years has been nuts. Looking back on it all the past week has been terrible. She would seemingly act as if there was no problem what so ever then out of the blue break up with me and either move to her Mother's with our daughter or kick me out. Only to lay down a list of demands that I would need to agree to in order for us to be back together which usually took place a week or so after breaking up. I was basically in charge of cooking, cleaning, laundry. While managing an 11 hour workday Mon-Fri.


 Our last break up prior to last weeks. We were apart for 7 months. We still talked everyday all day. And were still sleeping together. Her and I had agreed that we would take this time to focus on ourselves and our daughter but still remain in contact and not see other people. Well shortly before we got back together (unknown to me at the time) she had hooked up with some guy over the course of a weekend that I had my visitation time with our daughter. Same scenario as before. She lied, told me they hung out, she wasn't interested and it never went anywhere. Things had been pretty good this time around when we got back together it felt like it used to when we first met, we were happy and everything was going great. Out of nowhere our sex life sort of became well, lame. She would just lay down and say something like, come have sex with me and without foreplay, or even much kissing we'd do our thing and that'd be it. I kept trying harder and harder to get her more involved, and she kept pushing me away. Then she tells me how she's been upset because she lied and needed to tell me the truth.


So she came clean about what happened with this guy. I wanted to leave, but I stayed. Our daughter who was now 2 years old was so happy Daddy was back and living with her and Mommy again and god seeing her smiling face everyday when I got home from work sure made me want to stay. On top of that I felt I had already put my parents through enough shit and didn't want to move back. They were just having the youngest of their children finally move out and into their own place so they were all excited about having the house to themselves. Our sex life stayed in the same lame state and I'm sure was not helped by it now being stuck in my head that the reason for this sudden disinterest on her part was due to her sleeping with someone else. Something she denies to this day. 


Two Mondays ago, out of the blue. I came home from work to her telling me I need to go to find a place to sleep for a few nights. She said that she loves me but doesn't know if she's in love with me and needs some space. I decided enough was enough and the very next day I grabbed all my stuff  and moved back to my mothers house. I was determined to no longer let her do this to me.


Against my better judgment I gave in a few nights ago and went over to talk, we talked then had sex. The next night we talked on the phone for a few hours and again she kept saying how sorry she was that she told me she didn't love me anymore. Said that she was just upset and frustrated and didn't mean to say it. Said that she still wants to be with me and cried saying she hopes I can give her another chance. Friday night i went and had some drinks with friends from work and ended up calling her, went over and had sex. Now i feel myself being pulled back in. She keeps trying to pull me back, then when I put myself back out there for her last night she pushes me away and tells me that she wants to take things slow. She doesn't want to be together, she want to talk and hang out and still have sex. 


I feel like this is some weird way of keeping me close while making it okay for her to do whatever she wants i.e. sleep with other guys without feeling guilty.

 Any insight as to what she means by this would be greatly appreciated.


 To this day I don't know why I kept/keep running back. Part of me thinks its because I'm not happy with being the every other weekend dad to my daughter. Part of it is because I do still love  Maria but deep down I don't feel that love has ever been returned in the same manner and I greatly doubt the chance of that ever happening. I don't trust her, I never will. She keeps saying I have to let go of the past but I feel as though with her the past repeats itself. I have so many questions about what really happened. Part of me thinks she was cheating. Part of me thinks she wanted to get me gone so she could perdue someone else and when that fell through came running back to me.


My friends and family tell me she's crazy and to leave it alone and just move on.

1086,32xd3d,"Man, I'm in so much confusion. Let me start by saying that Ted [name changed] (My BF) is such a sweetheart (maybe was..? i'm so unsure now  :( ). We've been in a relationship for about a year and a half, and we are long distance. We met at least 8 or 9 times, so things are going pretty well, right?


Well, not really. The past few months have been a wreck. There have been trust issue breeches on his side 3 times, and I'm going through some pretty rough family shit. 


I requested one thing from him, which was support while I get through this rough patch, but he's been giving me the least of it.


**Exhibit A:**He talks to his physcho ex, and didn't tell me until the ex told *me* 2 months later. After asking him 20+ times over the course of the whole day, he finally told me that they spoke for a little, and he sent her pictures of me. (sketchy..?)


**Exhibit B:**Ted works for a popular dating app company. One day when we were video chatting, I noticed an OK Cupid notification. I asked about it, and he completely denied the fact that he had OkCupid! I told him that i'm not an idiot, and he told me that his team required having all other dating apps as possible competition or what not. okaaay..


**Exhibit C:** Co-worker. There's a co-worker at Ted's company who's around 30 isn, who's really attractive. Like, seriously attractive. Ted can NOT stop rambling on and on about said co-worker, and when I told him it bothered me, he just said sorry, I can't contain myself, she's total MILF material. Now, being 17, it was a huge ouch because I won't ever look like a mature hot woman, right? At least not in the near future.


And finally, the last one, which happened yesterday. Ted told me he would be super busy yesterday. He spoke to me once in the past 15 hours, which was not a big deal, at ALL. He knows that i'm in need of emotional assurance, and he agreed that whenever he had time, he'd talk to me and support me. Sounded great, so I just carried on with my normal work. When we caught up at night, I realized that we weren't best friends on snapchat anymore (the emojis man), and I just casually asked who he was snapping. I mean, there's 5 slots or something for best friends, and we were yesterday. I thought he was busy… so i kept asking him, and he kept denying that he spoke to anyone. I mean, it's so evident! He finally said that he spoke to a girl from his high school who used to like him, and they snapped the whole day because she didn't have access to text. What..?? He knows i'm in a position where I need as much help as possible, just for a short time, and he chooses to talk to a random girl for the whole day? idk, maybe i'm just clingy?


aside from that, we're perfect in person. not sure if the internet is a barrier for these things or not.

not sure if i would consider this a trust breech, but i did hide the fact that i lost my virginity to my ex for a good 4 or 5 months before telling him. i told him i was a virgin, but not sure if that matters because it's my past, and i feel like i shouldn't be judged for that.


he's visiting next thursday, so reddit, help me. what should i do? should i end this relationship before thursday, or wait it out? i'm super hurt, but i love him so much.. D: so confused.
   

**tl;dr**: confused if should end this relationship for real, or give it another try.

1006,1okj99,"What I'm about to describe in this post all started approximately in May 2013. For your information, I am currently 18 and she is also 18.

Turning 18 in April 2013, I decided to create an OKC profile. Everything was perfectly normal, but I wasn't having much luck, just like I was expecting. Then, after a few weeks of false-hopes, I stumbled upon the profile of the most attractive woman I have ever laid my eyes on. Not willing to fuck-up any chances I had (if I had any, that is), I decided to simply rate her a 4 star. (We were a 60-ish % match). A few days pass, and I log back on and she that I have had a visitor and a new message. The visitor was her, and it was an automated  message telling me that she has also rated me highly, so we should message each other. She was the first to send me a message, and all she sent was a :).

Long story short, we started chatting through the website, then she said that she'd prefer switching to snapchat. It's not what I had in mind, but I wasn't going to say no to this. Anyways, after a few snapchats I asked her out to icecream, and she agreed. At that moment, I was ecstatic. She was so beautiful, my friends didn't even believe it was her. Fast-forward to the day we agreed, and she isn't responding anymore. Then, she texts me that Snapchat bugged on her and she wasn't able to get in contact with me. Ignorantly, I see nothing wrong in this, and post-pone the date. She agrees. By now we switched to texting (I was using iMessage on my iPod. You'll see later on why I mention this).

She pulls the same shit and just disappears the day we'd schedule our date. Realizing what had happen the first time and feeling pissed-off, I just deleted her from snapchat and everything on iMessage. I left my iPod connected to my car radio for 2 weeks, and since it wasn't my phone, I wasn't able to know if she had texted me or not since I don't have a WiFi connection in my car.

Two weeks pass by. I take my iPod inside, for various reasons excluding the OKC girl. Lo and behold, she had messaged me back. I don't fully remember what she said, but desperate like I was, I started talking back to her. 

Same shit happens. We set up a date. She disappears. I put my iPod in my car for a few weeks. She messages me back again, like nothing ever happened.

The process in the last paragraph happened 3 times overall. This was kind of annoying me, but as much as this hurts to say, she was the only girl giving me any kind of attention so I decided to continue on with her. 

The last time she pulled this shit on me, I was kind of in a defensive stance, as I didn't want the same shit to happen. I don't fully recall what we said. 

I must say that I by this time, I was trying to be as fucked up as I could, to try to make her be uninterested in me and hopefully that would make her stop message me. Nope. She just told me that she didn't understand the shit I was sending her, and I told her the truth: I didn't really give a fuck about what I was doing. 

I asked her why she kept messaging me, even after she flaked. She said it's because she wanted me. At this moment, I wasn't sure what I wanted out of this. 

It was during this time that I found out the whole thing was a misunderstanding, and that she thought that I only wanted to get in her pants (which wasn't the case). Finding out about this, we set up another date. 

We agreed to meet last Sunday night. I went to the bar / club we agreed on, but she wasn't there. I waited around 15 minutes in the parking, and out of the blue she showed up and sat in my car. She finished her wine bottle while we were listening to Kanye (both our favorite), and talking. 

Then we headed inside. Unlike her, I'm not very familiar with the whole club-scene, so I let her guide me. While we were there, she sometimes just looked at me without saying anything and just smiling. After doing this a few times, she said I want you to kiss me and I did. We then went ahead and sat with her friends who were a bit further up in the bar / club. We exchanged a couple of kisses, almost all initiated by her. I learned that night that she is coveted by a lot of guys. A few guys tried to get intimate with her, but she flipped them off. Another dude, who I have never seen in my life, tried to tell me something, but she didn't want me to pay attention to him and told him to fuck off.

I was supposed to go back home after all this, but she told me that her friend's parents were gone the whole until Monday night, so we headed over to her friend's house. It was pretty boring over there, as there was already a few people (2 girls and 2 dudes), plus I had no idea who any of them were. One of her friends, upon learning that we kissed, came over running to me and said Oh my god! You're the guy that kissed girl'sname? Well I'm X, nice to meet you!

That was at around midnight.

At around 3:30 AM, her friends all go to sleep, and we're left alone in the living room. We headed to the basement on slept together.

The next morning was pretty weird. We didn't talk to each other much, but she talked with her friends. 

I left at the same time as her, at around 10:30 AM. When I got home, I saw she sent me a text saying she was deeply sorry for last night. Confused, I asked her what she meant. She replied that we weren't supposed to end up drunk and sleeping together, but she wrote it in a light hearted kind of way. She was right, as I was supposed to head back home after the club. However, she was the one that initiated most of what happen, so everything was consensual. 

I asked her if she'd like to see me again, and she said that yes, she would but she didn't know what I was expecting. 
We continued texting normally, about every day stuff, and she continued putting smileys and everything. I told her I was going to sleep, and she didn't reply. I didn't think much of it. 

The next day (yesterday), I didn't send / receive anything. At around 8pm, I asked her if she was busy tomorrow night (which would be today). She replied with a yes. I waited about an hour, and then told her I'd bring her out to the restaurant, and asked what she thinks about that.

She hasn't replied yet, but there is no read at X hour, so I know she hasn't opened the message. 

I deleted her from Facebook, instagram and deleted the whole iMessage thread, like I used to do when she bailed out. I'm currently unsure whether I'd be happy to see a message from her in a few weeks, as I'm uncertain if I something more serious.

I'm not really scared about fucking up while texting her, as I deliberately sent her bullshit to try to disinterest her but she continued texting me.

I'd love to know you guys' opinion on this.

Thank you!

**Full Story:**

My girlfriend (Sarah) has known her ex (Joe 31/M) since she was 14/15. Sarah at age 18 married her ex-husband Dan just as she joined the armed forces. Sarah has no family. A year in to their marriage Joe was in need of help and asked Sarah for it. Dan said Fly him to us, he'll live with us, it's okay. Joe while living with them snooped on Dan and found he was cheating on Sarah. Sarah and Dan got a divorce. Joe and Sarah were together for 5 years (basically since she found out and confirmed Dan was cheating). Sarah kicked Joe out and broke up with after 5 years because she had paid for everything in relationship and felt like his mom, Joe had two jobs each less than 6 months and was fired from both during their relationship. Sarah and I started dating six months after Sarah and Joe broke up, we've been together just shy of a year. Joe, in an attempt to get Sarah back when he found out we were dating got a job for four months then gave up. Joe has serious issues with his family who he has basically lived with his entire life except with Sarah (or Sarah friends, more on that further down). His family is a group of criminals to put it politely. Sarah feels sorry for Joe's living conditions and wants to help him. Sarah and Joe talk daily over text. The messages Joe sends daily are: Good morning babe, Hope you have a good day!, I love you, I miss you, Let me know when your safe (After he founds out Sarah and I out doing something together), she responds with pretty much the same thing as well as Keep me updated. We have an open phone policy since I occasionally use her phone but last night I actually snooped, reading their conversations she talks to him about life, things going on, etc.. that I would rather she talk me to about. Sarah still pays for Joe's cell phone which costs &gt;$100/month. Sarah and I are going to take a vacation together in a few months and she plans to have Joe watch the apartment and take care of the cat. (She doesn't like Joe's living situation and feels sorry for him) I am not comfortable with this and will be removing all my belongings if Joe does end up watching the apartment. My family has offered to watch the cat. Sarah and I are both financially independent and equally contribute to our living expenses. 

---
**Sarahs Friends:** 

Are all ecstatic that she broke up with Joe, they have congratulated me for being the best thing that has happened to her. When the news spread through the grapevine, people she hasn't talked to in years called her up and congratulated her for getting rid of Joe. This really upset Sarah. Two of Sarah's friends, who Joe was living with while she was deployed kicked him out for stealing and also because he never got a job to help with rent. The friends also refused to allow Sarah to pay for Joe for rent. 

---

**Joe's Background:**

Relied to me by Sarah and friends. Sarah still defends Joe no matter what. Joe is 31 years old and has had four jobs in his entire life, all less than 6 months. He has no education except high school. While Sarah was deployed, he's totaled her car twice and never repaid her. He has never financially contributed to her well being. Sarah kicked him out after 5 years because she felt like his mom and told him to get his act together. Sarah felt so depressed during the last year of her relationship with Joe she started seeing a therapist without Joe's knowledge. Joe only found out about the therapist because he snooped on her phone when they were hanging out one day from reading Sarah and I chatlog conversation. This lead to a huge fight between them. 

---
**My feelings:**

I do not like Joe. When Joe found out Sarah and I were together, Joe nagged Sarah to try and get Joe and I to hang out - to become friends. I said no. He now hates me and occasionally sends vitriolic messages to me through facebook. Also when he had his job for four months he asked to move in with us, I told Sarah If he moves in, I leave, he never moved in with us. **I feel I've been overly patient with her and Joe and would like her to end her contact with Joe**. When we first started dating I asked about the possibility of not talking with him or hanging out with him for awhile and she said that was a 'non-starter'. I can understand where she's coming from, she had 5 years invested in a broken relationship. She states she still 'cares' for him but I'm at a loss. When we discuss our relationship she says it's the best one she's had in her life; better than Joe, better than Dan, better than those before that.

I work for a big company, and a couple of weeks ago got a notice that my requests for vacation time off need to be submitted by the 29th of September, which is coming up pretty quickly. 

My boyfriend (who is awesome, loving, really great, all that stuff) own a company with his father and brother, so his time off is a lot more flexible and easily attained. All he needs to do is make sure someone will be there to cover him. 


**Here is the issue** My boyfriend has an annual tradition of going on vacation somewhere in the February-March period. We're Canadian, so they typically go somewhere tropical as life is pretty miserable here by then. He's been doing it for the past 5 years or so- so, longer than I've known him for. 

When I first went on the trip with him (and some others) I was very way of getting in the way of his trip- I didn't give any input on when, where we went, because I didn't want the group to feel like I was making it about me. It was a great trip, I think we all had a fantastic time. He really likes to 'fly by the seat of his pants', so we didn't book the trip until about a month before hand, which is how we've done it since then. He refuses to plan things in general very far in advance. 

This time around is a bit different. I work for a different company, and the way we have to request time off is a lot harder. **We all got an email a couple of weeks ago telling us we need to submit our requests for vacation time by September 29th**

I'm still of the mind that I don't want to impose my will on the trip, as it's not just a trip for the two of us- his younger brother always goes on the trip, as well as any of their friends who are up for it. 

But, I need to submit these dates. I've been after him to just give me a two week span that he'd be willing to book the trip during. I can probably move around some of the dates once I've put the request through, but it's a big company and the times are taken pretty quickly.

A couple of minutes ago, I felt exasperated and just asked him to please, please give me a period to book my vacation time during.**I can move some dates around, but I need to at least book something or I will lose the time** 

He refused, said that he 'doesn't know what to say' because they have no idea at all what the trip is going to look like. I don't give a single, solitary shit about where we go, I just need to book the dates off.

This ended in a huff because I realized we were going nowhere. I feel like he's being astronomically selfish- He can go on vacation literally whenever he wants, he doesn't have to submit a form or try to wheedle other employees into covering his shifts.  It's incredibly inconvenient to him for me to do this  *but here's the thing* - It's inconvenient for me too. 

I'm hugely pissed off right now. I feel like he's being the biggest brat I've ever met, because he doesn't like what I'm saying. 

Is there a middle ground? Or should I just take the high road, book the biggest period I can, and then try to make it fit around his Royal Fucking Highnesses' schedule?

She says she never would have contributed to my education financially if she had known I’d never return to my hometown. She also still regularly tries to entice me to move back to my hometown by offering to give us a down payment on a house in the area (but this is not possible since we both work here, our child got a spot at an inexpensive but high quality daycare here, and my husband’s child is with us half the time and attends school here). We try to visit as often as possible and my family knows they are always welcome to visit us. We travel to see them 3-4 times per year and they come to see us 2-3 times per year. My in-laws live in the same town as us so we obviously see them more often and it makes my mother extremely jealous/resentful of them. 


**The Issue:** My husband and I decided we'd like to spend Christmas at our own house this year with people visiting if they choose. Trying to coordinate custody, friends, and in-town and out-of-town family was rushed and stressful and we argued a lot. We decided that we wanted to have happy Christmas memories for the kids and to create our own traditions. We will alternate years that we travel on Christmas so that we still see my family but this year, we were hoping to visit them either before or after the actual holiday and to stay for longer than we usually would to make up for it.

Needless to say, my mother didn’t take that well. She said that “THEY” (my in-laws) already get us most of the time and it’s unfair that my family never sees us (which is untrue). She said that I “abandoned her years ago” and that I don’t care about family (which is also untrue because I call/text regularly, send birthday presents, visit when possible, etc). I tried to explain the reasons mentioned above and that it wasn’t ideal for us either but that we’d be there for the actual holiday next year. She took this very personally, started crying, and handed the phone to my dad to end the conversation. My dad took it better. He said it was too bad we couldn’t come and asked if we would consider re-arranging our plans but if not, to do what we had to do and let them know what we decided.


**The Aftermath:** I feel horrible about how I’ve handled this. Everything I’ve read and everyone I’ve spoken to (husband, best friend, therapist) has said that I acted appropriately. I tried to be kind but firm. I tried to be fair by offering options. I tried to give lots of notice for her to get used to the idea and so as not to disrupt any plans she had made. I tried to take my own needs into consideration and do what’s best for my own little family. I tried to reiterate that we would really like to see them every year and that this isn’t ideal for us either. I didn’t engage in an argument when she made accusations because I know she said it out of hurt and I forgive her.  

I know the timing isn’t ideal since my brother is going away for college soon but my employer wants to get holiday hours sorted out so I need to let them know. I also feel like I should have invited my parents here but I know that’s not a practical solution because all other family members they’d want to see (including my siblings and their families) are in my hometown. I feel bad that she sounded so excited to talk to me and that I made small talk first before bringing up the issue when she asked about work.

I feel so guilty because the holidays mean a lot to her, especially since her father died around that time of year about 15 years back. I really do wish I could be there and in the past, I probably would have just gone to make her happy. But I’m told by my therapist that I’m not responsible for the happiness of other people and I need to take care of myself in order for me to be happy and in turn, be able to take care of my own little family. I know I’m an adult but I really have trouble saying no to people, especially my mother since she invested all her time raising us as a stay-at-home mom and is easily hurt. I know that I can’t control the reactions of other people but I can’t help feeling responsible and wondering if there was something else I could have done better to avoid this (besides living with my parents for the rest of my life LOL). 

To be honest, I feel a little resentful too. I understand why my mom is acting this way and I know she’s entitled to her own feelings. But  I feel like I’m being guilted/manipulated and I don’t like it. I’m so frustrated that she refuses to move forward at all and refuses to come up with practical solutions. Dosen't seem healthy to me. I wish she was able to manage her own reactions to things better instead of me having to walk on eggshells all the time. All of this makes me feel more guilty and conflicted because I don’t want to think of my mother badly when she has done so much for me in so many ways. I think she could probably benefit from seeing a counsellor to work through this but how do you bring that up to someone without offending them?


So now, I’m worried about her being depressed and want to know how she’s doing but I know she probably needs time to process this. At the same time, I don’t want her to think I’m ignoring her. I wanted to ask my brother how she is doing but I don’t think it’s fair to put him in the middle. When would be appropriate to contact her? What do I even say? 


Is there anything I should have done differently?

1084,35wisc," So I'm 17 It's been around 5 or 6 months now since last contact and I'm still not over her. Now, we never had a real relationship but my feelings for her are stronger and more real then the feelings I've had with my actual girlfriends. I'm convinced she is the only girl I will ever love and I have no clue if she ever had even the slightest amount of the same feelings for me. I met her one time when my bud was dating her, it was nothing. Some time later I began hanging out with a group of friends which she did also. My feelings caught extremely quick, and it was very obvious. She used to sing to me in the car to the radio, make silly faces to me. I was slightly convinced she had feelings for me. But the self conscious side of me told me she didn't. I knew I was falling for her and I couldn't stop it. I figured we weren't going to go anywhere in that way and stay as friends. A few days later she came on to me and we did things. It carried on for about a week and I was stuck. I thought about her nearly all day every day. Then she dropped me like nothing and went back to her ex.

Over the next few months, my feelings never died down. Although I didn't think about her nearly as often, I was doing just fine. One day she text me in the morning, telling me how she missed me and asked me how I was. According to her it was supposed to be a simple Hi and bye. The conversations carried and became a daily thing, we began hanging out and she started cheating on her boyfriend with me. She convinced me she had strong feelings for me and she cared about me deeply and that once she took up the strength to dump her boyfriend we could be something real. A month later she finally breaks up with her boyfriend. A week later we hung out one last time and she stopped contact with me. I didn't want to be clingy so I let it go. Three days later I text her and the conversation ended very quickly, it was obvious I got played. I was torn. A few weeks later she had sex with a close friend, and another close friend.

For months I cried over her, obsessing over the things I could have done differently to win her over. No contact what so ever. So I go to a party and shes there, we did nothing but she came up into the room the next day and we had a chat. That same morning we began texting again and for about three days she was once again convincing me she had feelings for me and the only reason she pushed me away was because all she was used to was men treating her like trash and I didn't. She dropped me once again, to get with another dude. No matter how much I know she hops around from dude to dude, and I was just a side dude, I cannot get over her.

Day by day I still thought about her. My feelings never changed. I would always hope that I'd run into her just so we could catch up, or so she could see how good I was doing. It never happened. Now, its been around 7 months. I moved out of stated, and I'm still not over her. I don't know what to do. I still dream about her often. I'm trying my hardest to forget about her and nothing is working. I know I'm only 17 and most will say I'll get over it. But I haven't and feelings haven't changed what so ever. 

 Tl;DR - So basically I fell for a girl who I never actually dated. I guess it was kind of like we did because we talked like a couple and argued like a couple, but we never made it official, and she always made me keep it a secret from everyone.

183,1z2pfs,"We had met each other once at halloween and we knew who each other were. We talking a bit, not much. 

Seen her at the local pub and said hallo and nothing more.
Then she started at my community college and that was nice I guess. 

A classmate who knew her said they would go to the local pub next day and we would meet other there, because she seemed to be nice.
It's saturday and I met them there and I wouldn't really drink that much because I had huge hangover.

She bought shots and everything, cool I guess.
Later they would go to a club and I said I didn't have money and she bought the ticket for the enterence. Nice.
We had really great and fun. Later on we kissed and made out. We got each other numbers and cool. She regretted that I didn't followed her home. (She lived in another town.)

We decided that we would meet sometime in the week. I didn't take it super serious because we were drunk and so on. But we talked.
It's Wednesday and we toke a coffee and walked a bit and she took the initiative to take my arm as we walked, so okay, she likes me. Later on we kissed first time sober, good. 
We went to the movies and do the movie cuddle. Everything went really good.

Next day we meet each other again. We were first at her place and talked and kissed. I slipped out the words I have a crush on you, she said she had that on me too. (She later commentated that she had checked about me earlier and so on). I also slipped that if she wanted to be exclusive and she wanted (I remembered when we were at the club if this could led to something and she said yes.)  Went to a bigger city because I had to fix stuff and we went to movies again. Everything went good. 

I went to her sometimes and have slept with her several times and that we could go to school together.
We had the same values and interests. We wanted to have separate life that we do what we want with our friends.
It's Saturday (Important day for later on the story) We went to the local pub because they were going there and we would met. She had friends with her and I had mine. She told me that had something deep to tell me, but would't dare to say it. (Day after she told me it was that she wanted to move to another city far away, but that's something I already knew)
She wanted to go to a club, but I wanted to go to a afterparty at my pals. But I wanted to be with her, but she said I should go to the after party because that what I really wanted.
I was supposed to go with her back to her town, but my mobile died so it was hard to be contacted. I went with the first train in the morning  to sleep at her place. 
The day went good I guess, we would go to restaurant with her friend and her boyfriend.

Later that week on Wednesday she went to a so-called work meeting with a common friend and a guy that went to the pub that went with her last Saturday. Alright, you do that, I don't care.
She was being bit sick for a time and she become more distant for a reason. And on Valentine's day she would work, so I tried to plan a day so we could meet, but she never had the time (even she said she was free on Wednesday). So I was asking was wrong and she said I don't think I can give you the attention you need (I said for a dumbass reason that I would need attention time to time, but I believe she misunderstood me, I meant like cute sms and so on). We decided we broke up and we would meet each other about it and so on. 

The day we meet I picked her up at her work and we had fun and talked about stuff and so on.
Then we had the talk and it went well without any fight about it and we ended as friends. We understood this was going to fast and we should know each other better. Agreed.
Then this sentence that have bothered me Maybe we should know each other better, maybe there is some defects(?) that you wouldn't like.
Okay. We saw a movie and hanged out for the rest of the day before she was going to meet her friends.
I feel comfortable now.

Three days later she is in a new relationship, I was chocked and heartbroken and was like WTF.
This for me meant that she had talked with someone else behind my back. And this guy I know who it was, it was the guy from the pub who went with her and her friends. And he is the guy who brought her and the friend to work meeting. This guys is 4 years older and have studied sales or something.

So I felt back stabbed.

**Maybe a important thing about her**. She told me she was bipolar and no many who knew. So a trust thing to tell. Heard by her best friend that we have in common that it takes time for her to show her feelings.

**Things I have might have done that I'm not supposed to**: Taking it to seriously too fast. Said I wanted attention (misunderstood), making her tell what she is feeling.

**Personal opinion**: I think we match and when she told I got something deep to tell you I believe she wanted to tell me she was in love in me. 
She had some exes, sure. Maybe she has trust issues because of her father who always have some excuse so they can't meet each other.

Some weeks ago an old FWB wanted to hang out. He wanted to go to the sex sop but was nervous about going alone I kept getting a bad feeling and I told him no but he was really pushy so told him we couldn't do anything he swore it up and down so we hung out. Anyway on the way home he pulls over and says he wants to take a picture. He elaborates that it's just a picture of me holding a dildo he bought and a picture of me with my mouth on it. I did it. Then he asked for a handjob but i looked away and demanded he take me home so he finished himself and then drove me home. I don't know what was going through my mind but I felt like shit and I told the boyfriend and he was very hurt but agreed to forgive me. I think I just went because I was being impulsive and when I'm being impulsive there's one thing I really want to do and I'm willing to do almost anything it takes almost no matter the sacrifice no matter how flawed my goal is. When I went I'm pretty sure I was expecting an advance and was expecting to shoot him down and shove in his face how I got to have a relationship that I don't screw up and he's sitting there begging for attention. Obviously didn't go that way. 


None of my actions are justified and I feel like shit and right now me and the boyfriend are at the point were we're trying to move forward and I can't do anything (besides never doing it again) but support him until this is truly behind us.

567,2j64qg,"For some context, the ex and I had been together for nine months (April 2013-January 2014).  From the beginning, things turned out wonderfully… I guess.  I mean, I never had a boyfriend before him.  But I suppose I didn’t need past experience to know that this was going to be a good relationship.  He listened to all my problems, helped me with my homework, opened all the doors for me for our college formal; hell, he even got me a red rose for my birthday.  He was a brought-up-in-Catholic-school gentleman, goddammit!  My family loved him and his family loved me.  Though he never told me that he loved me back, I still believed that he did.

Then by Christmas time, our relationship hit a “snag.”  Not that either of us did anything wrong, it’s just that he started ignoring me up until our breakup.

Now, I was forewarned by his roommate that this guy has communication troubles.  Being the communications major that I am, it was my self-appointed duty to keep the fire lit, so to say.  I would always ask him about his day on a daily basis, just to remind him that, you know, you have a girlfriend and that you are loved.

But to be ignored over Christmas break, I began to forget what his own voice sounded like.  I began to wonder if those nine months we had been together even happened.

Come January, he breaks up with me in the most civil way possible:  by telling me in person.  That’s a luxury, apparently.  No reason other than “I just can’t keep doing this.”  That still didn’t stop me from questioning everything:  “Were you tired of me?” “Where did I go wrong?” “What should I have done differently?”

Here was a guy who had seen me inside and out, my first everything.  To have all that taken away from me made me contemplate the mortality of everything.  Relationships and people die.  I couldn’t control that relationship, but I could certainly control how I myself can die.  That’s what I concluded.  I even sent him a letter the following week telling him exactly how I felt, which I’ll be willing to share if there’s demand for it.  After reading it, he told me that he couldn’t help me anymore.  That he didn’t know how.

My counselor was very apathetic about my breakup situation, so I didn’t even bother going to my appointments again after that.  I began cutting again and had to be hospitalized for depression (again).  I tried to take up exercising, just like I had done after my last hospital trip, but still nothing.

He said we could still be friends, but we haven’t had a proper conversation since before the breakup.

Anyway, today here I am, still depressed as the day he left me with maybe just a little more anger.  In fact, I got drunk at a party recently, found some lighter fluid and boasted to my friends how I was going to drench him with it.  Like, how dare he be better off without me, right?
I guess I really am one of those crazy exes you hear about in an Ask Reddit story.

I know I have some personal demons that need to be absolved, but considering how much smaller my support group has gotten, I’ve run out of resources to turn to.

What I ask of you, /r/relationships, what I want most of all, is for you to help me be happy again.  I don’t care if I’ll never see him again, I just want proper closure.  None of this “Maybe if I ignore her, she’ll get it,” but an actual conversation with this guy.  One where we can finally say our goodbyes.

Basically, my friend has been dating a guy for about two months now, which is great since her last breakup was pretty damn bad and at least, by my standard, that's when it really stops being simple dating and moreso a relationship.

However, she keeps inviting me to things that we'll say... are usually more reserved for couples? Stargazing, horseback riding, movies, most of these just one on one interactions.

541,3dencv,"Long story short (Ill try to keep it that way...) my husband had some serious issues he kept well hidden until after we got married a couple years ago. It wasn't known to me until a very close friend of mine came forward and told me something that ruined my life. He had been pursuing her online for a couple years, which she hadn't taken seriously, but he had be inappropriate with her in person and after that she had to tell me. 


I never really faulted her and understood why she hadn't told me about his messages to her. I read them and she redirected all his attempts back to talking about me and it was clear she had no interest ever. She told me she just didnt take it serious enough to warrant causing a bunch of drama until he made it known in person while we would all hang out and I would go the bathroom during a couple day trip to see her.


I obviously confronted him to get his side before acting rashly about it and he admitted to being in love with her, that he was rethinking marrying me (we were 4-5 months in to our marriage, together over 7 years total at this point) and it was blamed on me recovering from surgery for a couple months that had made him lose his shit and attach to her.


I never knew about these messages, I never knew he was even having a hard time with my recovery (I needed some help driving for a month or two and we had to change what positions we did during sex to not hurt me and the like). I know I complained too and was on pain killers on and off for a couple months and had stopped being as fun while I healed. I still worked, paid our rent, and was very active with him. I never abused the pain pills ever, he had to convince me to take them sometimes as I hate them. To me it was just part of life and something that would heal and we'd move on, I just had no idea. I was beyond devastated to learn this and it has forever changed me.


Anyway it came out he had a lot of issues and has been in therapy for over a year to deal with them. Some OCD and narcissism traits and the like. We separated for a bit and strongly considered divorce. I decided with all our history it was worth trying and so did he and so we did. There was never any physical cheating that happened so I've done my best to move past it and address our issues and he has really been trying too. Very diligent in his therapy and what seems to be a genuine desire to learn how to manage his issues. This glosses over this part of things but it hasnt been easy but even our marriage counselor agreed things have improved and she thinks we should stick it out, that couples go through worse and make it and we have a great chance.


In fact things have been going so well we're looking at buying our first house. I'm wary definitely but Im financially stable on my own either way and the house is being sold by a good friend for very cheap and would make a great investment. I don't want to put my life on hold anymore than it has been for the last couple years. If we divorce, we divorce and I am smart enough to handle it then regardless if we own a house or not. 


Anyway the girl, who I still remain in contact with somewhat, lives out of state and is visiting for the first time since.


I am a terrible liar. I never lie if at all possible. However my therapist has told me it could be really really bad to be honest with him about her being in town. She is someone even he admits he could never see again without it messing him up. I agree with this and think it would turn all the hard work we did upside down and mess up the house buying and cause a bunch of unneeded drama I dont mentally think I can handle. 


However I am a bit of a wreck lately knowing Ill see her for the first time since and that I can't be honest with him about it. Not to mention that but the rest of the friend group I will be seeing pretty much dropped me when I tried to work it out with my husband because they didnt agree and I have really missed them and have taken it hard when the closest girl in the group told me the rest of them decided I wasnt worth hanging out with anymore because I had been a real downer the initial months after finding everything out. So Its just a big reminder of all the loss I have had the last couple of years and a hard time for me. 


Clearly my husband has picked on this as I have cried a few times and been a bit needy (wanting to cuddle more, feel reassured we're solid...). I had to ask him a question in regards to a sensitive topic last weekend and his answer was hurtful (yet honest) but I overreacted a bit and got upset and royally pissed him off. He's been very cold and distant and annoyed with me for bringing up something from the past for what he sees as no reason.


I tried to explain I am going through some personal issues right now and I know they are causing me to act more sensitive to things and to please just try to understand I am sorting through something on my own I dont want to burden him with. I was trying to tell him this so he wouldnt think I was being crazy and stupid for no reason. Well now he is really suspicious of me, knows I am hiding something since I clearly dont know how to lie or be subtle about anything, and is even more cold and distant.


He started questioning me if I had brought someone over without telling him and from what I can tell thinks there is some other dude or something. I would NEVER do what he did and have dropped or distanced from any male friend who has ever crossed a line or who I realized I had a crush on. I am 100% loyal and am honestly pissed off his first reaction is to go there. 


And on top of that I will be seeing the girl and know it will really be hard but its something I have to do for myself. I dont know how to handle that and I dont know how to handle my husband. My therapist is out of town for a couple weeks and I am trying to navigate this situation with grace and maturity. I plan to explain to him soon as she leaves town what was up but the way he is being so insensitive and making me feel like an idiot is really hard for me to handle right now. I am afraid I'll lash out if I dont take some space and go see my family more or go to a movie or something by myself or spend more time at the gym. I know if I do that, since we spend our evenings together most the time, he will continue to think I am out with some guy or something crazy and it will make it worse. And when I go see her I will have to lie about that... UG I HATE LYING! I guess it does look really bad and I feel terrible. I just dont know what to do.

So 1) How do I handle feel insecure about things right now without showing I am upset or taking space for myself? 2) How do I handle myself when I see the girl again? Any advice for how to not fall apart here and ruin my life even further?



   
**tl;dr: Husband had emotional affair with friend where he fell in love with her but she wanted nothing to do with him and told me. Rest of friend group dropped me during the time period when I decided to try and work things out. Friend is now visiting for first time since and Im a mess. Therapist and I agree best to not tell my husband she is in town but he knows something is up since I suck at lying. He now thinks there may be another guy. I need advice before things blow up.**




EDIT: I suppose this may not be the best place for advice. Im sorry if it came off at all wrong. I dont have many people to talk to and am just trying to get some advice other than leave your husband. I didnt make a decision lightly to stay with him and haven't just rolled over. We've been in marriage counseling and individual counseling since the whole thing happened well over a year ago. We've switched around therapists even to find one that is actually helpful and will call either of us out on our shit and give us productive ways to address issues. So far so good.

Im not at all, even a tiny fraction, defending his actions. Just sometimes good people do shitty and hurtful things and people do overcome infidelity if the right approach is taken. My friend group said the same thing and I know had I not gone through this I would have probably been telling someone else the same thing too. But him falling for someone else does not erase all of the support and love he has given me and my family through some really hard times. It does not erase everything else he has done for 9 years. I have no idea if we'll make it longterm, I am being realistic, just trying not to let me life be defined by this shitty thing any longer and to move forward wtih my goals.

I also feel seeing the girl is necessary for me to move past it. My therapist agrees with this and thinks it will be healthy in the long run, though obviously will not be pleasant up front.

1165,1o12yg,"The back story to my problem is this:

I had a boyfriend from junior year of high school until sophomore year of college (We'll call him Bryan). He is 22. He broke it off with me due to our long-distance relationship getting to him, among other things going on in his life. I was devastated, and it took a few months, but I moved on. Junior year rolled around, and I decided to pick up dating again. I met a wonderful guy (whom I'll just call Jake) online and had a wonderful first date with him. He was 22, I was 20. Unlike my first boyfriend and other guys in between, he had me intellectually. He challenged me to bring out sides of my personality I had never known. He didn't look like my type--I was a straight-A student on my way to a criminology degree and a career as a police officer, he was, according to my parents, a no-good grease monkey whose salary and choice of clothing style made him look like a bad boy rather than the good person that I saw him for. We dated for a few months, and even exchanged the big I love you. I regret what happened next...not because it ended, but what I did to do so.

I received a phone call from Bryan one afternoon. He wanted to apologize to me for all he'd done, and ask for a second chance. My heart fluttered. I shook. I was...ecstatic. I selfishly went back to him without even giving Jake a fucking warning. Jake was floored, but understood I had my reasons, and let me go, no arguing, no begging for me to come back.

Flash forward to the present: I am still with Bryan, and our relationship has been smooth, but I'm not sure if I want to spend the rest of my life with him, like he is beginning to talk about. I still talk to Jake once in awhile, just to catch up and shoot the shit once in awhile. Two days ago, he texted me saying he was seeing a new girl (we'll call her Katie). I was genuinely happy for him! He had a girl that had her shit together, unlike I did, and lived a little closer too. But then, he dropped a bomb on me:

He wants me to meet his new girl. He thinks we'd get along well, and that was actually HER idea. I assumed two things from this:

1. He may talk about me to her more than what makes her feel comfortable, and she could have felt pressured into him having me around more often
2. He's doing it to possibly give me the turn-around for what I'd done to him

I know I shouldn't be losing sleep over this; I do feel as if I messed up, but I wish in NO way to mess up his new relationship if they are happy. But we have the same friends, and meeting her will be absolutely inevitable. I know to be polite, respectable, don't bring up unnecessary memories around her, or to give her the stare-down and compare myself to her. It's just that...I'm extremely confused as to why, instead of just wanting to catch up and work on just being friends, Jake wants to do this so soon? It would hurt, I know it would, to know that I may have made a mistake, and I'll be paying for it in the form of having his new relationship rubbed in my face, if that's his intentions. I would love another opinion on the matter, and whether or not I should just decline meeting her for the sake of saving face.

However her rent is raising to an unaffordable level and she's been looking at places for the last couple of months.  Every one in her price range has had *something* wrong with it, be it the bathrooms too small, or the kitchen is too small, or there's no fireplace. She's expressed that she does NOT want a roommate situation.  I've offered for her to move in with me (I own my own house).  She does not want to live with me either.

Another coworker has been trying to get her to move in with him for some time now.  I've always suspected that he has a thing for her, but he relentlessly flirts with just about every semi/attractive female in the building.  I've expressed that I'm not comfortable with this situation but she's decided to go ahead anyways, despite even saying that she would be uncomfortable if I decided to get a female roommate.

The thing that probably irks me the most, is that he's now going around telling people that I'm uncomfortable with this situation.  NOT FUCKING COOL with me.

The problem is we'll be living in the same area as my ex and I have no idea how I'd respond to them meeting. I dated my ex for two years, when I was 17 and he was 19. After a year, he raped me while we were on vacation. I did not think at the time that it was rape if a boyfriend has sex with his girlfriend against her will (I've since discovered Feminism!) so I stayed with him for another year and never reported it. When I finally realized the shitty situation I was in, I broke things off. In my state though, if you don't file a report or talk to the police before six months after the event, it doesn't get any attention. I was also convinced that cops would not listen to me because the rape happened out of state, I didn't have any evidence, and because I was 18. 

My current boyfriend knows all about this and has been very supportive. He's not the kind of guy who would throw a punch because someone did something to his woman or anything, but he is a male feminist/ally. The thought of the two meeting keeps me up at night. I guess I'm here to ask for advice. When they eventually meet, do I act polite? Do I cause a scene? I really don't know. 

(For those wondering why they'd end up meeting, I'm very involved in local nerd culture and my current boyfriend has shown interest in sharing the convention experience with me. My ex is a pretty popular cosplayer at local small conventions.)

170,1zn2xn,"A little bit of background information: I met this guy two summers ago through a mutual friend. I wasn't trying to date anyone at the time, so I never took him seriously, although he definitely told me he was looking for something serious. He's a 7th grade science teacher in my hometown and I'm in my senior year of college 230 miles away from my hometown.

Three weeks ago, we started texting again (I'm not really sure on who started talking to who) and I ended up visiting my hometown on Valentine's Day weekend. He invited to hang out either at a bar or to go to his place. I was busy almost all weekend long with family but I finally ended up going to his place before I left back to my university town. We watched League Pass (I'm a huge NBA fan and so is he) and we talked. He told me he still talks to his ex that he broke up with in September, which I didn't mind because I still talk to my ex that I broke up with not too long ago as well. He even told me she wanted to get back together but he wasn't sure if he wanted to. I have a really great time just being around him and he's told me the same. 

Here are my problems:
1.) I told the mutual friend that introduced us two years ago that he and I started talking again and she said, I think he's still with his ex, she's always talking about some boyfriend that she has on Facebook. My heart sunk. I am really into this guy and really enjoy my time around him. A friend of mine lent me his password so I can see for myself what the ex posts (judge me, I don't care.) Sure enough, my friend was right. On Valentine's Day, THE WEEKEND I VISITED HOME, she took a picture of an alcohol arrangement with the caption that said what I made my boyfriend for Valentine's Day and I know for a fact that picture was taken in his kitchen. Another one of the ex's posts said, my brother, my boyfriend, and my best friend's birthday is all this month, looks like I'm going broke this month. His birthday is March 29th. Here's the weird thing though, he and his ex are not Facebook friends and she never uses his name. She always just refers to him as my boyfriend. It strikes me as odd. This past weekend, he came to visit me in my university town. He stayed at a hotel and I only stayed over with him on Friday night. We spent the weekend together and he honestly makes me really happy. I confronted him about what his ex was putting on Facebook. He said, I told her to stop putting that crap about me being her boyfriend. We're not even Facebook friends, we do hang out and she wants to get back together with me. I told you that. *Which he did* I told her I'm not getting back together with her if and when she starts taking me seriously. She never did the 'girlfriend things' so I broke up with her and now she wants me back but she hasn't convinced me that she's changed. He told me what he meant by 'girlfriend things' and I understood. It's not any of my business why they broke up, I just don't want to possibly date this guy if he already has a girlfriend. 

2.) It's not as big a problem as the first one, but he almost never likes to text or call. I know he's a professional and has a life. He hits the gym religiously and has over 150 students' papers he has to grade pretty frequently and of course is at work from 8-4. When he came to visit me I paid close attention to see if he uses his phone often. He didn't which kind of put me at ease. But I've just been always told that if a guy is into you, he'll call, he'll text, he'll make sure to let you know he's into you. We talk for a cumulative maybe two hours a day. Not consecutively, kind of sporadic.

So reddit, I need your help. Am I kidding myself in thinking this guy is into me? Should I walk away? Should I let it play out? Any help would be appreciated. Thank you.

When our son was 9 months old, the three of us (husband, son, and I) moved over 2 hours away from where I had lived most of my life. That was where my friends and family were.

972,2c0n08,"So, I have this bad habit: I babble to myself.

Ever since I was a kid, whenever I'm alone, I talk to myself.  Usually it's just muttering under my breath about what I'm doing, kind of organizing my thoughts and telling myself what to do, but sometimes it's at an almost-conversation level of volume.  I never knowingly do it in front of people and I don't really know why I do it.  It's just something I've always done as long as I can remember.  My mom always did the same thing, so I guess I just sort of picked up the bad habit from her when I was a kid or something.  But I do it almost constantly when I am alone.  I even talk in my sleep sometimes.

My wife and I have been married for five years and together for eight and she finds the whole thing absolutely hysterical.  There have been about a million times I have suddenly noticed her standing in a doorway listening to me babble away as I went about doing something.  She often tells her family, friends and coworkers funny stories about it.

Well, today I was out running errands on my day off while my wife was at work.  I had to call her and ask about something she wanted me to pick up while I was out.  I asked her about it, she told me, and then we got off the phone.

Or, so I thought, because apparently I didn't hit the hang up button hard enough before I set the phone down beside me in the passenger seat of my truck.  This is also something I've done about half a dozen times.  You'd think I would learn.

My wife works in an office with about two dozen other women, sort of a cubicle farm environment.  Everyone knows everyone.  And, apparently, they spent the next ten minutes with my wife's phone on speakerphone listening to me babble away like my wife was always telling them about and having a grand old time cracking up about it.

Mostly, I was talking to myself about my errands, a bunch of stuff I was needing to get from the hardware store for a re-wiring job I'm doing in my garage, reminding myself what I needed, talking through what I needed to do first in my head once I got the stuff, etc.

Except somewhere between the time I thought I hung up with my wife and getting to the hardware store, I passed a jogger and this is where it all went south.

I am normal red-blooded guy.  I notice women, like pretty much all men are wired to do.  And this jogger was dressed very skimpy for the heat and was well-endowed to put it delicately.  So, of course, I noticed when I passed her in my vehicle.

But, apparently, I also commented on it briefly before going back to my hardware store babble.  I don't actually remember doing it.  I don't actually remember any of what I said in my truck today.  I just babble.  And I want to stress, before I go any further, that I wasn't cat-calling anybody and I would never do that.  My windows were rolled up and there was no possible way this woman could've heard me.  In fact, I only know that I did this at all because my wife has angrily quoted me about a dozen times tonight.

But... *apparently...*  I whistled quietly (you know, like Bugs Bunny does the wolf whistle thing in cartoons when he sees a pretty girl) and then said: Holy shit, look at those titties.

And my wife and all of her coworkers heard it.

My wife tried to play it off like she didn't care and thought it was funny at the time, but she said she could tell most of them were really shocked and had, in her words, Holy crap did that just happen? looks on their faces.  She is mortified and so was I when she told me.

I've spent most of the evening getting yelled at by her for this, and she now apparently thinks I'm some kind of huge pervert.  I'm really not.  I never say things like what I said today.  I honestly think I'm just a normal guy who had the same thought any other guy would have--it just stupidly came out of my mouth, because of my babbling thing and because I thought I was alone. 

My wife, however, now thinks I'm some kind of horny sexual deviant who goes around ogling and doing a running commentary on every good-looking woman I see, but that may partly be anger and embarrassment talking.

825,3clk6s,"Hi /r/relationships! Throwaway because, well, we all do it.

I met my boyfriend at university in our first year. We have a lot of similar interests, so kept seeing him at societies and lectures. We became friends quite quickly, mainly through being in the same group of friends. I started to get a crush on him after about 3 months of knowing him, and we started a relationship a month after. I thought it would be great. 


Of course it isn't though, otherwise I wouldn't be writing here. Since our relationship started I have been feeling more and more depressed (I have been diagnosed with it before) and had to take time out of uni. At one point I could barely leave my room at uni, and he came over everyday just to ensure I ate. He loves me a lot, I can see that. But there are just so many things which I don't know if I can ignore them. 


-He doesn't eat vegetables/fruit of his own accord. He used to avoid them as they made him sick, but has started to eat them again recently. But not unless he's pushed. On a recent holiday to Italy with some friends, we bought a melon and he refused to eat it, and sulked when he finally did. I love fruit and veg, and try to try as many as I can. This also translates to his unwillingness to try new foods a lot of the time. 


-He is very, very quiet when he is around people he doesn't know. He's always scared people will judge him, but this has left a bad impression on my family and I don't want to bring him to outings with my friends in case he just doesn't talk at all. 

-Not very adventurous. One thing I want to do for certain is travel a lot and possibly live in another country for a while. He, however, can't take the heat (a problem when I would like to try to live in China) and has said he has never seen himself living outside of the country. 

-I feel like I'm constantly in control. Not just in bed (I can handle that) but in everyday life. He's so...passive. In Italy me and my friend had to drag him around, essentially. I got incredibly fed up at him for this, especially when things went slightly wrong and he started sulking. 

But I can't just break up with him, not without some help from outside. None of my closest friends are in the country for me to rant at them for a few hours on the phone, so I turn to you all. He's very sensitive, he didn't have any friends at all for a few years before uni and so is doing really well going from no friends to a group of them. He suffers from depression as well. We're living in a house (with others) next year at uni. One of the people living with us has said to me don't break up whilst we're living together or something along those lines. 

I feel like if I were to say something about it, I would hurt his feelings so much he would withdraw and all of his good progress would go down the drain. We've both tried so hard for him to get here, I don't want him to drop all of it now. He might even hurt himself. I don't know, and that scares me. 

Our friends, I feel, would judge me for it- I mean, I just feel like I want to be single right now! Go and be free at uni, have a few flings, find someone who pushes me in the directions I want. I think they would find me selfish for hurting him just for this. I feel like I am selfish for it. And it would affect both our home life next year and the social events we go to. I mean, maybe I shouldn't have gotten together with him if we were going to live together, but that's my fault. 

I just don't want to hurt him. I'm so so so scared he'll hurt himself or become a hermit and stop being my friend- I get along with him, I really do. We share so many interests! Just not in that way. I understand we can't be friends straight away, but I'm scared he'll go further and stop going out. He's said he might do as much before, hypothetically. 

There are good points to going out with him; he's very attractive to me (at times, when he's in a bad mood I don't feel it). He cares about me a lot and I feel like it would be hard for me to find someone who cares about me so much again. 

I'm sorry if this doesn't make much sense, I feel like I'm about to cry constantly from how bad I feel over this and I'm writing on mobile. If you have any more questions I'll try to answer as well as I can.

179,27iwui,"Hi guys, first post here but I'm really hoping I can get some advice. Sorry if things don't make sense, I'm sleep deprived and somewhat out of it!

It's a pretty long story, but the TL;DR version goes something like: Liked a guy for years, out of my league, I get cuter/older, mutual cuddly friendship ensues, he asks me out, blowup with his sister (a really close friend of mine), a few awkward semi-dates and cuddles, communication drops completely for a while, but things are still weird.

Basically I've liked this guy for a really long time, and due to the nasty blowup immediately after he asked me out (literally the next morning), I started to get over him. The cuddly behavior just confused and upset me, so I did my best to cut off communications. Sort of worked, but we still see each other sometimes and we've slipped into cuddly/flirty behavior whenever we're together for more than a few minutes. 

In a way, I'm over him. There's a lot of characteristics about him I can't stand, and I've been trying not to dwell on the positive things. The only thing really left for me is some sort of residual jealousy, where I still (despite everything) sometimes really want to date him/get mildly upset when I see him with other girls. I think he's mostly over me, but he's insecure and desperate for a girlfriend, and I'm decently cute and a compulsive flirt (is that a thing?) so there's a good chance one of us would end up falling for the other again. The irritating part is I know I'd be nearly perfect for him, but he isn't someone I need in my life right now. 

What's worrying me is that, starting tomorrow and over the next 10 days, we'll be in together in a pretty small group and out camping. The thing about this trip is that it's notorious for creating one or more couples each year. Since this guy and I already have history and most of the other people are significantly younger or related to each other, there's a very good chance that the curse might hit us, just statistically speaking. 

In a more realistic sense, I'm worried he'll get bored and we'll end up hanging out (I'm the closest girl to his age going/the only real suitable match for him), and I can see myself (for lack of a better word) seducing him and possibly seeking revenge for how much he hurt me earlier this year. Is there anything I can do to minimize the chances of this happening? Keeping in mind ignoring him/only talking to other people would be hard, since it's such a small group...

1194,31obhe,"Basically the title says what I am struggling with; I will give you guys some background here, just trying to make sense of it all.

My sister and I have always lived with my mother and father until we both left for college. Growing up, there weren't really any large family issues. We all got along, my dad worked full time as an engineer and my mom stayed at home with my sister and me. Things were stable.

That all changed in the mid-2000s. I am not exactly sure when, but my dad lost his engineering job and somehow was never able to get back on his feet. He had a couple odd jobs here and there, but never was able to get a job that utilized his experience in his field. My mom was a complete asshole to him during this time. She made him feel really bad about his situation, but tried to help sometimes; however, my dad never worked at his former level ever again. The thing that was odd about the whole situation was that it seemed like my dad didn't want to work again. He didn't really try to find new work, was really apathetic about everything and it made me upset to see him so defeated.

I was pretty nosy as a kid, and during this time, found a bunch of e-mails on my mom's email account with her and another man, let's call him Jack. They were graphic, it seemed like she had known this guy for sometime, but there wasn't any talk of them two meeting up, mostly just intense flirting. I printed off the e-mails and showed them to my dad and mom and made a big scene about it. My dad was furious, it was really the only time in my life that I was physically attacked by him (240lbs vs my 130lbs at the time) and I was too scared to really do anything about it. I'm not sure what discussion him and my mom had, but they didn't break-up or divorce, and things just kind of eventually went back to this uncomfortable normalcy with my mom now working to support the family and my dad just kind of moping around all the time not doing anything. 

I left for college and things were obviously tremendously better for me, but then got much worse for my sister. I think since she was the only child left in the house, all of my mom's focus was on her. She made things really hard for her, pressuring her and bugging her about things all of the time. But then my sister went to college and things got better for her, until my mom called a bunch of my sisters friends and left anonymous racists voicemails on their phones (but that is a different story)..

Fast forward to the past 12 months. I don't have a facebook, but my cousin told me that he posted pictures of my godson on facebook, so I used my mom's facebook to login in to look at them (I knew her password because I helped her set it up). I go to type in my cousins name in the search bar and the first name that pops up is Jack's, second name, Jack's wife. I click on his picture and think to myself, Holy shit, this guy looks a lot like my sister.

I tell my sister about my theory and she looks at the facebook too, admitting that Jack and her look a lot a like. But we both agree that this has to be ridiculous, there is no way that this random stranger is her father. Fast forward a couple months, and my sister gets a notification on her LinkedIn saying that Jack viewed her profile. Creepy. Fast forward another week or so and she notices that Jack sent her 2 blank e-mails. How he got her e-mail address we have no idea, but now things are getting too strange to ignore. So she calls out my mom and asks who is this man and this is what my mom tells her.

She says that Jack is crazy and obsessed with my sister. Jack has no kids of his own (he has 2 step children) and is a very successful business man (talking multi-millionaire, I verified this) and is having some sort of midlife crisis. He saw the picture of my sister and told my mother that that has to be his daughter. My mom tells my sister that he wants her in his Will, as he truly believes that he is my sister's actual father. 

My sister asks my mom how could this happen? She says it's possible that he is her father, AKA my mom basically admitted to having an affair with Jack during the beginning of her and my dad's marriage. Jack agrees to get a paternity test and the results come back that he is indeed the father of my sister. 

I believe that my mom knew this the whole time. I believe that my dad found this out back when he lost his job in the first place and that my mom tried to leave him to be with Jack but for whatever reason it didn't work out. Basically my mom has been lying to me my whole life about this, and is now acting like it isn't a big deal. When initially confronted, she was almost giddy, like excited about the prospect that my sister could indeed be Jack's daughter, or excited that she is finally finding out about it. 

I am having a very hard time processing all of this. I am very angry, she lied to me, my dad, my sister, and my whole family for our whole lives. Then again, my mom gave us a decent upbringing from a support standpoint given the circumstances, she spent a lot of money on our educations made a lot of sacrifices and coped with a husband that wouldn't work; and it paid off. My sister and I both have high paying jobs in solid fields, albeit some emotional scarring. But I keep coming back to this lie.

I have a couple of questions for reddit:
1. Has anyone been in a similar situation where they found out that either they or one of their siblings had a different dad than they were lead to believe?
2. Do I have a right to be angry at my mom?
3. How should I proceed here? I honestly do not want to speak to her again.
4. My extended family still does not know about this. Should I tell them? I feel like they deserve to know the truth.

L and I dated for about two months before we made it official. As soon as we did, it started going downhill. We both agreed that keeping in touch with exes or people we dated in the past wasn't necessary since we were working on our future together. We did give exceptions including people who were strictly platonic friends and those friends could NOT have feelings for either of us (honestly, I'm much more laid back and really could give two shits but since she felt strongly about it, I agreed on the condition that she also follow her request). L also became good friends with my friend's girlfriend (we'll call her M) since they had mutual friends. These two things are very important to note.

A few days after we made it official, we got into an argument over social networks. L was upset that I didn't follow suit and delete people from my social networks. She then accused me of having fucked all the girls I used to date that were on my social networks and accused me of keeping in touch with them because I didn't have faith in our relationship. I flipped out and told her to grab her shit and get the hell out of my house. I totally overreacted. I was upset she accused me of something that wasn't true or was none of her business (regarding past flings). We patched things up and remained together.

A month later, L goes away on vacation with her family and during our phone conversations she continously asked if I was talking to any exes or hanging out with any women. I told her no and the only female I hung out with was a friend L happened to meet and was comfortable with. L became very angry but reassured me it wasn't because of the friend. She just continued to accuse me of hanging out with other girls or talking to exes.

Honestly, I fucked up. I had very small conversations with my last ex, just catching up but nothing more than that. I never initiated any contact and she was respectful, never saying she wanted me back or anything else. However I never made mention of L to my ex. I lied to L because as small as I felt the conversations were, she would have been upset. I fucked up.

A few weeks later, a different ex texted me and we spoke briefly. L was changing music on my phone and noticed the text and calmly asked who the girl was. I told her and she flipped out. She said she knew I was lying and I eventually caved and admitted to talking to my previous ex as well. This is where it gets interesting.

L revealed that M happened to tell a mutual friend that I was talking to ex girlfriends, that I was cheating on her, hanging out with my ex girlfriends and that I was being intimate with some girl while L was on vacation. M's friend told L all these things because she was concerned for L. This was the main reason why L constantly bothered me about exes.

I don't have much of a friendship with M. She blatantly told her friend TONS of stuff and just so happened to be right about speaking to my ex. That was the only accurate accusation.

I apologized to L and told her I should have been honest and that I would do anything to regain her trust. I eventually contacted my ex, telling her she needed to respect my boundaries and to never contact me since it was affecting my relationship.

Our relationship was strained after that. I noticed L just didn't trust me as much as before and things didn't feel as great as they used to be. We continued to argue and I decided to end the relationship. Sadly, I ended it a few days before a wedding we were supposed to attend. Dick move but I couldn't take it anymore.

A few days later, we got back together. We go on a trip. It was an awful trip and we got into several arguments. When we returned I ended the relationship again (on my birthday). I had enough but God, did I love her so much. I felt if we could just move on from the past we could do fine. Most of our arguments stemmed from the lies M said so if we could just move on from that we would be fine.

A few days later we give it one more try. We agreed to a blank slate. Everything went well for a few weeks but the beginning of this week is where it went downhill again.

L confessed to me that she didn't feel confident in our relationship. She was upset that I never apologized to her for breaking up with her on my birthday (she had reservations made and put a lot of effort for my special day) and felt that I would break up with her at any given time because of the last two breakups. I reassured her that was not the case, it never crossed my mind about how much effort she put in to my birthday and I apologized.

One thing I need to mention is that L recently told me a story of how a friend from her old martial arts school made a comment to her that her butt looked smaller (on one of her social networks). She told me that some of her friends, along with her family, made similar comments. I was a bit bothered because she did mention in the past that she had dated a few guys from her old school so I wasn't sure if this guy was one of them. Regardless, I didn't put too much thought to it.

We go out for some day drinking. She was going to hang out with her friends and I was hanging out with mine. She told me a few days ago that her ex fiancee might make an appearance (she stressed she did not invite him, she mentioned she was going and he happened to say he was as well) and she asked if I was comfortable meeting him because they were still friends (he was an exception to the exes thing mentioned in the beginning of the post). I said that's totally fine. However when I met him, he was love struck. He looked at her as if she was the one that got away. Granted, he didn't cross any boundaries and didn't say anything disrespectful and L looked as if she was seeing an old friend. However the fact that she kept in touch with someone that was clearly in love with her still, contradicting our previous agreement made me upset. I didn't care that he still loved her (I knew she could handle him and he was intimidated by me) but I got rid of women who were platonic and didn't have any feelings for me all the while she disregarded our agreement and kept in touch with her ex.

We go home and I head off to work. Now, I had previously deactivated my social networks because I felt they caused issues for my relationship. When L and I broke up, we both deleted all the pics we had of each other. I never bothered to reactivate my accounts to put pictures of us back up and she never bothered to put pictures of us up either since I didn't have any on mine. We both did keep our profile pictures of us together. So at work, I reactivate one of my accounts to accept friend request when I decide to take a look at L's profile. I notice TONS of pictures of herself that were recently added and the last one added was a picture of her from the side, showing her butt sticking out a bit (she was dressed casually). L tagged someone (a male who happens to do the same martial art she used to, not sure if he was from the same school) and commented Lol it's still there but not like it was before haha. Considering the story from before, I felt she took the picture, tagged her friend from her old school and specifically took the picture of her butt for him. On top of that, I notice that she never fully removed people that we agreed she was supposed to (they still had access to viewing her profile). Now I'm furious and I felt like a fool.

L noticed I reactivated my account and asked why I didn't take the time to put pictures of us up. I decided to confront her. She said the picture had nothing to do about her butt and there were a string of comments before, including her sister and some friends commenting. She said the tag she left was for someone who had commented on the picture and the comment was regarding martial arts stuff. Later on, she claims the comment was regarding how the guy used to joke about how her stomach used to pop out as if she was pregnant and she commented that her stomach was still there. I tell her she's full of shit and can't kep her lies straight. A part of me does believe her (she does delete pics and comments constantly, usually if someone says something disrespectful at which point she deletes that person) but another part feels like she's lying (she could also delete the comments and pictures as if to hide flirty comments from me, but I'm not sure).

I mentioned her ex. I didn't speak of it before, but she had previously lied to me who he was when he had commented on an old post of hers months ago. L previously said he was a friend, then upgraded it to someone she dated. She never admitted the person who posted was her ex fiancee. I only realized it because when I met her ex fiancee, he had the same name and looked exactly like the person who had made the comment. L told me he means nothing to her and she never knew that he still loved her, otherwise she would have told him to not contact her ever again. I reminded her she lied about that because in the past, she told me he had confessed that he missed her and wanted to be with her. She said she wasn't aware she said that, apologized and reiterated she would tell him not contact her and delete any methods of contact they could possibly have for me.

I also confronted her about the people she said she would delete and called her a hypocrite. She agreed and said she just never had time to go through the list. She apologized and told me she would delete everyone in front of me. I told her I never cared who was on her friend's list, I only cared that she asked me to do all these things but she never did the same for herself. I told her anything she did was pointless because I felt she was taking advantage of me.

I then broke up with her. Now she continues to call me and wants me to reconsider.

I'm sick of her shit but I love her so much. L was the only person I pictured having a family with. I know I messed up and I'm grateful she gave me another chance, but we've had so many problems that caused us to break up, I don't know if the relationship is worth giving it another shot. Am I wrong in not giving it another chance? Was I overracting? I know I can find someone else but I dont want to. She and I are perfect for each other, we just can't for some odd reason make a relationship work because we're just immature, dumb idiots who can't grasp the concept of communication and sticking to agreements.

246,1hmiwc,"So I met her via online dating site and after the first time meeting each other things progressed quickly and we spend large amounts of time together which is great , except from a very early point in the relationship she started reading all my texts and invading all my privacy which I told her multiple times I was not comfortable with but let it continue because I new there was nothing to see so hopefully she would accept that I am honest and give me my privacy like I ask. (I have never said or done anything to make her think I am untrustworthy) 

Yet every time I am not with her she questions what I have been doing in a very interrogative way, and sometimes doesn't believe me. For example the other day I said I was at a trading card store and she found that suspicious under no grounds at all. 

In the back of my mind I am thinking maybe she is so suspicious because she is hiding also she snapchats a lot with random men who I have seen send her sexual snaps and seen her history that she snapchats them back all the time but she claims she never sends anything sexual and she hates that they msg her. (WHY REPLY THEN??) I have told her that I dont like it that she messages them back because I have seen her open snaps of them just showing off their cocks and asking her to snap them back.

So today out of nowhere I get a text from her saying Aww your buying me stuff thanks babe and when I asked what the message meant she replied saying she just assumed I would buy her something today. Today is no special day so this doesn't make much sense other than it might of been intended for someone else. Thoughts?

915,2hqbjr,"Preface: My coworker and I were both raised christian and what ensues is a very painful alcohol-related experience where neither of us knew what the hell was going on.  

My coworker (I'll call her Jen going forward) and I decide to go to another coworker's wedding reception together.  This is great for me because I'd been interested in Jen but very shy about dating, so the reception seemed like a good pseudo first date to test the waters.  

We get there (in separate cars) and things go pretty well, like it could have been an actual date if I had asked.  Jen is louder and less inhibited than I expected, but this is the first time I've seen her outside of work.  Then I start noticing that Jen is stumbling a bit when she walks, and I confirm from her that she had a few drinks before coming (there was no bar at the reception).  

After the reception ended early, we explored around the venue a bit.  Jen is hanging on to me a lot as we walk around which I was totally OK with, but in retrospect she was probably having an increasingly difficult time standing.  After using the restroom, she sat down at a table and rested her head on her arms, becoming unresponsive or very quiet at best.  I didn't realize how drunk she was until she went back in and vomited.  She can't really stand or walk, so I try to carry her out of the building with my non-existent, never-been-to-a-gym muscles.  We get outside and she needs to throw up again, which is good for me since my arms are getting shaky.  

Eventually, (after vomiting a few more times) we got her to my car.  I can barely hear her when she tries to tell me where she lives, so I end up driving across town before I realize I misinterpreted something and have to turn around.  

The long and short of it is, now every time I see her I think of how she looked doubled over on the ground.  It's also a bit weird to have her feeling so embarrassed and apologetic about the whole thing.  I have no idea how she really feels about me or what I should take away from that evening.  I also have no idea WHY she drank so much, though admittedly she obviously didn't want to get THAT drunk.  I really wanted to give this a chance. I thought she was really fun to talk to and attractive, but now I keep second guessing myself.

784,2dup8l,"Hey reddit, my girlfriend and I have been dating for almost 4 months, and met in high school. Before we met, we decided on which colleges we were going to attend. I chose a local community college, and she chose a bigger University about 1-2 hrs away. I love her and trust her very much.

Here's the thing, I'm scared. I'm scared she's going to put herself in a bad situation accidentally, or someone else will do something I wouldn't like to someone I care about so much. She leaves later next month, and I'm going to hate being so far from her - but we both want to make this work.

She's a partier, she drinks, smokes sometimes, all that. It doesn't help my nervousness at all. I know she wouldn't do anything to harm our relationship intentionally. I know what happens at universities. 

Maybe I'm just over-thinking it, but I really need to comfort knowing that she'll think of me before she does anything questionable. I love her too much to lose her to something stupid like that, and I want to make it through this without always worrying about her like I do.

I guess I'm just looking for some type of closure to this issue, and all insight is greatly appreciated. Thanks people.

668,1fx6wk,"We've been dating a year now, and the first time he brought this up was about a month after we first started having sex. Basically, it's a fantasy of his for me to have sex with another guy and he really wants me to do it, but I don't want to. For me, once I'm in a relationship that's it, that's the only guy I have any interest in having sex with while I'm in that relationship. I have never had a wandering eye or anything like that, it's just not who I am.

I told him that, but he keeps pressing the issue. It doesn't happen too often but every week or two he'll bring it up again and try to convince me to do it. He keeps reiterating that it wouldn't be cheating since he was giving his permission, that he wouldn't be mad or jealous at all that I was doing it with another guy, and that it would make him happy. He's really focused on the idea that I don't want to do it because I think I'd be betraying him, but that's not it. I just don't want to do it.

I've been trying to watch my tongue around him lately because if I'm watching one of my shows and comment on the attractiveness of a celebrity or make a joke about wanting to make out with them or something, it'll start up this whole debate again because he thinks I'm serious, but that's not even true either. I might say oh that actor is so hot, I would do him in a second, but I wouldn't *actually* want to do it. My boyfriend doesn't realize that though and takes it as proof that I actually want to do it with other guys deep down.

I really wish this whole mess would just go away. I feel bad for my boyfriend for having a fantasy that he won't be able to fulfill with me, but our sex life is pretty good otherwise. It's not like he's only able to get off on this one thing and he'll be completely unsatisfied without it. 

Another thing is, if he had mentioned it once and then let it go then I wouldn't have had a problem with it, but after bringing it up again and again it's actually stated to upset me that he wants this in the first place. I am a good girlfriend. He never, ever has to worry about getting cheated on and he's acting like that's a *bad* thing. Sex is important to me, not just physically but emotionally, and he wants me to just give it away to someone else.

Tl;dr: Boyfriend wants me to have sex with someone else to fulfill a fantasy of his but I don't want to, and he won't let it go.

**UPDATE**

I talked to my boyfriend after he got home from work and things actually went better than expected. I told him that I did not under any circumstance want to have sex with another man because I didn't have any desire to do so and never would. I told him it was very hurtful to me that he would keep pressing me to do something that I clearly didn't want to do, and I pointed out that if he acted jealous over me just mentioning a TV actor then would he really not get jealous at all if I had sex with another person in front of him? He insisted that he wouldn't get jealous, but he apologized for being so insistent about it.

After talking about it for a little while, he admitted that he felt ashamed for having the fantasy in the first place, and he felt like he really needed me to want it too so that he would feel validated and not so crappy and alone. I had never considered that before, so I asked him if he knew anyone else who had his same fantasy and he said no, and I asked if he knew what the word for it was and he said no. So I told him that I had done a little research on it and found out that it's a thing with a name that a lot of people like, and that seemed to comfort him a little, although he also asked some questions after that implying that maybe since I had done research on it I would be more inclined to try it. I told him again firmly that I am not going to do it and said to stop trying to twist things around so that I sound like I will do it because that's manipulative and it makes me feel shitty.

I was planning to tell him to never talk to me about it again, but I didn't know that he was ashamed of it and I didn't want to close that door on him, knowing that, and make him feel worse, so I told him that I loved him no matter what and I'd try to be there for him, but I couldn't be there for him if he kept trying to get me to try it or thinking that there was a chance of me trying it, so that needed to stop. Then the conversation was getting a little intense so we took a bit of a break; he made some food and I went on Reddit for a little while.

And then when we had cooled our heads a bit I asked him if he maybe had any other fantasies that would make him feel something like what he wanted from the cuckold thing that just involved him and me. He said there were a couple things he wanted to try but was too afraid/ashamed to ask, and I asked what they were. They were kind of unusual compared to what our current sex life is, but they didn't involve any other people and they didn't seem like anything that would make me feel uncomfortable. So I told him I would try some of it with him and see if we couldn't find something special that we can do together that we'll both enjoy. He was kind of embarrassed about the whole thing still, but he said he was truly sorry for being so pushy and that he didn't want to push me away. 

So that's pretty much where we stand right now. I will look up subreddits later this week for some of the new stuff he wants to try (basically me being really assertive and pretending to be mean to him, in case anyone knows where I can find that?) But I'm pretty emotionally exhausted and things are still a little tense and apprehensive between me and him, so I'm just going to try and relax for now and let things settle down a little. I'm going to keep an eye out for him being pushy about cuckolding thing, but I am actually pretty sure that we can work this out? I'm holding out hope at least that I'll like this new stuff and he'll like it just as much and it'll make the cuckolding not feel so critical to his satisfaction with our sex life. So yeah, that's basically the gist of it. I will post another update when something new happens but for now I appreciate all the advice that you guys gave me.

1041,1vzltq,"Hi. So I had been seeing a guy for only 1 month, from mid december until now. We hung out multiple evenings a week, and talked on the phone late on nights we didn't spend together. This was uncharacteristically fast for a relationship to develop for me but I didn't care; I felt a connection with him like I've never felt before, with anyone, and I have had serious LTRs before. We discussed this and he said he felt the same (actually he brought it up first). He also told me he and his most recent ex had broken up a year ago and he was ready for his next relationship to be a serious one. We acknowledged that's where this was heading. I have never gotten along with someone so well nor had so much in common with someone. When I say we have a lot in common...we have the same life dream in the same career path. We have the same political and religious views. We like the exact same kind of music (spent hours sharing music with each other when we first met). We love the same activities and are passionate about the same social issues. I was floored by how perfectly we meshed. He actually joked that I was his dream girl about 2 days after we met, and that I seemed too good to be true. We haven't had sex yet but have kissed and made out quite a bit and spent the night with each other several times.

Then suddenly last week (tues), he didn't call me when he said he would. I called, no answer. Texted, no answer. And I haven't heard from him since. He is still active on facebook, twitter, and instagram, and his ex and her family members have been liking the things he posts, and HIS family members have been liking all her comments on his stuff.  

Well I engaged in some softcore fb stalking and found that there's no way they've been broken up for a year. She tagged him in a romantic post as recently as October 2013. After then there is a sudden disappearance of her from his page. It says they just became fb friends again last week, around the time he stopped talking to me...

I'm doing everything within my control to NOT blow his phone up trying to get ahold of him but I'm going crazy. I'm so hurt and confused. In our last conversation he told me he wasn't seeing anyone else and was loving getting to know me, and was excited to make plans the next day. Bam. Silence since then.

I feel like I've been cheated out of something really good... like an opportunity I really wanted was yanked from before me just as I was reaching for it. I feel so torn up. My friends are so sick of hearing about this and keep rubbing in that it was only a month of my life. They are right, I know it. But I just feel like crying **all the time** and I can't help it. I also just got the flu and have been home sick the past 3 days, crying and coughing and sniffling in my bed and watching Law and Order, so I don't even have work to take my mind off of this.

I guess I just needed to rant more than anything. I wish he would just contact me and let me know what was going on. I feel so desperate.

605,1nduda,"Around a year ago I broke up with my ex-girlfriend. I was having trouble with my OCD and anxiety issues and was not in the right state of mind to be in a relationship. I thought I made the right decision for the both of us, but ever since then there hasn't been a day I haven't thought about her. I loved her, and it was a very hard thing to deal with. I decided shortly after to start losing weight (went from 190 to 125) as a way to make myself somewhat happy and to keep my mind away from her.

Throughout this whole time I would (stupidly) check up on her blog and check how she was doing. Around the beginning of the school year she posted that my best friend was hot and she wanted to be with him. This stung but I wanted to be a good friend so I put my feelings aside and I told him I would be okay with it; this was mainly because I didn't think her and I would ever really talk much again.

A couple of weeks ago we DID start talking again, and over the past weekend we spent a few days together just catching up and having fun, until last night...

I went over to her place and we just hung out and talked for awhile, until we both sort of got bored and decided to drive around. I didn't want to waste gas so I decided, hey, as an amateur astronomer I'd love to just park somewhere and look at the stars with her. I parked at a park, we both sat in my trunk (SUV) and talked for awhile. The topic came onto how I was now and if I was happy now that we weren't together. I knew I shouldn't have said anything, but I wanted to open up to her.

I told her I was okay, but I did miss her and she's always been on my mind. We both just broke down and talked about how crappy our lives have sort of been since the breakup. We hugged it out, and then...we kissed. And kissed some more. Then made out. And then we both cried some more from how wrong it all was. She said that he did feel bad for dating her (probably because he knows I still cared for her) but he didn't really care. 

This was all very scary for me because I didn't think we'd have ever come to this. I didn't think I'd be in a situation where we were talking again, much less being intimate. I still find her attractive and to be honest I still have just as much fun as I used to when we dated.

Now I'm here, reddit, trying to get some help putting this all put together. I know what I did was wrong, and I know that I can't even tell my best friends this because it'll turn into a huge mess. I don't want to hurt anyone, but looks like I may have to.

Brief summary of what life is like at home:


* I am finishing up my last year of university in April. After that, even if I don't find a job, I should be able to pick up enough casual work to make rent every month or shift my part-time job to full-time to make ends meet. We live in Canada. 


* My sister [24F] has an autism-spectrum disorder, to the point where she will likely never be able to live on her own without supervision or find gainful employment. She lives at home. 


* My parents [61M/60F] are having severe issues, both in terms of mental health and their marital life. They have fought often since I was a teenager. I discovered last winter that my dad was cheating on my mom for around a year or two, and kept quiet because I didn't know how to bring it up. My mom discovered it in April through their health insurance. She said she was going to divorce him. This has not yet happened, in large part due to the fact that...


* My dad attempted suicide in May. He was hospitalized for a few weeks and then released. He is now at home, on antidepressants, off work for stress (which will essentially become a retirement for him), and sees a psych once a week. He has been having severe tremors, which his doctor believes is Parkinson's. He has a neurology appointment next month to investigate this. Since April he looks to have aged five or ten years. 


* My mother is extremely stressed at work. She will likely retire next summer. She is constantly angry at everything and everybody when she is around my dad, and they fight all the time. It is my belief that she needs serious counselling, which she will not take for fear of destabilizing my sister even more - in her own words, how would she feel if her other parent melted down right after the first? My sister was completely devastated when they revealed they were going to divorce, even while aware of the underlying issues. My mom does not want to go forward with a divorce until my dad's neurology diagnosis and until he has a better grip of his mental health. My parents oscillate between sorting through dad's issues with one another and tearing out one another's throats in the kitchen. I strongly suspect mom has not left because it would destroy my sister and possibly kill my father. 


* As if this were all somehow not enough, our house is in awful disrepair and we live in something approaching abject squalor. It has been slowly killing itself over a period of many years between foundation shifting and roof leaks. My room and my sister's rooms are uninhabitable in moderate to heavy rain due to water leaking through my window frame and leaking into our light fixtures. The plaster in the walls are all cracked from shifting and stained from cigarette smoke. The basement rooms are full to bursting with borderline hoarded junk, and the basement walls have bowed and buckled because of the shifting. I have offered to help clean out the basement many times to no avail. We have been looking for a new place to live for a while now - because we have pets renting is somewhat out of the question, but nothing is within our price range and mom wants to stay in a familiar area for my sister. It also seems somewhat futile to them to go to the trouble of buying a new house if they divorce anyway. After a recent heavy rainstorm, my mom finally fully realized that we have to get out of this house...but we haven't actually made any moves to get out. 


Between the house and the fighting I don't know if I can live here anymore with my sanity intact. I also don't know if I have the willpower to abandon my sister to her fate here or leave my dad in good conscience with his failing health. I also don't know if I have the resources. I have $1600 to my name, and a car. I make around $300-400 every two weeks during the school year, depending on the week. My girlfriend [21F] offers to let me stay with her and her family when things get really bad. I don't think I would be able to live with them for an extended period of time.

I am no longer sure if I can cope with this situation, but I don't think I can leave either. Please advise.

We still live together as we are both in university we got a house with 3 other people and so cant really avoid each other which is hard as it makes it difficult to get over her. There is no real way one of us can move out as we're students and don't have the money to do so. It also confuses us both as its difficult to become friends this quickly.

I'm unsure what she wants as she keeps asking about going to watch films and hanging out in university such as after lectures or coming to watch me play football. We also keep talking and joking around like when we where going out. Then she will disappear to another guys house and wont say a thing for a day or two and avoid coming home, which makes me feel like shes with him or is it her just wanting space from me.

I'm really confused and don't know what to do as I want her back but i feel every time we talk it just hurts us both. She has told me that she wants to be along and single for a while and after after this she would if there was any feelings for me would like to try again.

Two weeks go by and I can't have sex with him. I don't even like hugging him. I feel unattractive which is ridiculous, because I know I'm not. I'm humiliated and I don't know how to bring it up with him, because I'm so embarrassed. Everything else in the relationship is great, but my self esteem has gotten so low that I'm starting to think I should end it for my own mental health.

401,1vrm2m,"Hi! Thank you in advance for reading this and/or posting a comment.

I started working at this pretty great charity October 2012 doing accounts payable, (of which I have three years experience). The person whose job I took, (he was promoted), trained me on the procedures of the job function. I'm a really hands on person but he didn't seem to take to my learning style so there was a bit of a struggle with my ability to pick up some of the coding. (If you've done a/p, it's not a hard job but holy crap-- the coding here is ridiculously detailed and compartmentalized into tiny meticulous boxes.) A part of his new position would be to edit my invoice batches which is pretty standard procedure at most companies.

The controlling aspect of his personality began pretty soon after I started. I felt like I was being graded on a test with all of the red marks on my batches. Now, understandably, things have to be consistent and I understand that. I noticed though that he started making me re-word descriptions to how he liked them. At first I went along with this but after a month I started to question why because it's such a minor part of the batch as a whole and my descriptions covered what they needed to. Then, he started to go physically talk to people about why they coded something one way or another. I feel like I should have been the one to do that but hey, he's wasting his time, not mine. He started to keep detailed records of the mistakes I was making, e.g. keeping my edit sheets with his marks all over it which was not a practice with him or any other person who held my position. It escalated to where no one even knew he wasn't in the a/p position anymore. Even worse, someone said that they thought he was my supervisor. 

I decided to start asking him to redirect people to me if they had a/p questions, (everyone was still going to him), and to please stop doing anything that was a/p related as it is my position and my responsibility. I asked him a total of three times over three months.

(this started nine months ago)

The third time he went absolutely ape-shit. I mean rushed me out of his office, (I ended up ducking because he moved so fast), screamed at me never to talk to him and then promptly quit. No one really said anything to me, not even my boss who is the CFO. Two days later, he comes back to work. Things are tense and we end up getting a lecture from my boss and an associate director. Neither of us get written up although I kind of wish we had... more on that to come.

Things quiet down for about a month before the cycle starts to repeat itself except for him going off the deep end. It goes like this: quiet, he only emails me instead of talking, leaves all of my work up to me, then he starts talking to me again and starts trying to do all of my work again... my boss tells him to stop, he gets all pissy and the cycle repeats.

The most recent time he actually had the balls to ask my boss if he could work overtime to get something that had shown up on my desk Thursday afternoon after I'd left. (We work four 10s so that's my Friday.) I know this because my boss told me. You're probably wondering where he is in all of this. The man hates confrontation. I mean he HATES it. It freaks him out, you can see it in his eyes so I don't bother bringing anything up to him anymore.

Lately it's been back to emailing until last week when he started talking to me again. I got an email from him about some checks that I'd ordered not being the right color... yep. The company didn't offer the color I needed. Actually, here's the email:

*I see that when you ordered new checks for CB that you got green instead of red, all is good, but when you re-order for the Foundation can you try and remember to order blue. Thanks.* 

So I went into his office, (I rarely email him), to let him know it wasn't an option. I'd let my boss know as well. I should also mention that every email I receive from him, from five feet away actually... his office faces my desk, my boss is cc'd on it.

I got this this morning and pretty sure I saw red...

*After you told me they “the people we order the checks from” no longer have red I thought I would find out if they still have the color blue for Foundation checks. I thought you might want to put in an order for Foundation checks before they got rid of blue. FYI they did say that they had the color Maroon which is similar to Red. Thanks again.* 

I double checked myself and realized when I ordered a certain option, it limited the color option. So I made a mistake. I'm not even mad at myself. I'm mad because he went behind my back and called them. He does this with everything though this isn't the pettiest.

Before I ask, what the fuck do I do?, I'm going to leave the pettiest thing he's ever done here:

Someone had purchased two different kinds of tape so I coded them to office supplies. We're talking like $5 here. He asked me about the tape and I just said that's what i'm coding them as. He called the damn director of that program to confirm which tape was going to be used for what. He literally spent 20 minutes trying to figure out where $5 of tape went. We have a buffer zone for this shit.

So, what the fuck do I do? My boss can't or won't help me and I'm on the verge of tears due to anger because I feel helpless. I need this job, my town has a horrible job market and I cannot afford to not work here.

(There are so many more instances, but these are the basics.)


*edit* I am so appreciative of your feedback! It's helping me wrap my head around it better and gather the mental strength to handle it the way it should have been from the beginning.

(also, thanks for no mean comments so far, it's brightening my day)

I cant do this anymore I had just lost my job a month earlier. I skipped vacation because we were supposed to buy a house. 

Over the next week I saw her fall out of love with me. slowly she became more distant and cold.

eventually she asked to take a break, I asked to see a couples counseler, I asked many times over the following months. I told her a break was a bad Idea, but I would do it for her, not US, for HER. I left the apartment.

We have the same group of friends, our entire lives are intertwined.

we met regularly. then after two weeks we talked and she said (verbatim) I love you, but im not IN love with you right now, I need time away from you to see if I miss you so I left her alone for two weeks. after that she told me that I dissapeared off the face of the earth and still wanted to see me, I told her you asked me to leave you alone. I did. I respectd your wishes, even if you didnt respect them yourself.

during this time I started smoking and drinking again out of stress. I've lost 40lbs from not eating, I sleep 1-3 hours a night.

eventually we started ignoring each other at houseparties. 

this weekend there was a houseparty at the place i was staying, she got really drunk and was falling all over the place and totally acting attention-whorish. it was heartbreaking. in the morning before she got home I went home and packed up 80% of my stuff. she got in and asked me some questions, I was cold. she asked me if she had done anything to anger me. I responded with its been 3 months GF! we talked and talked about out inability to communicate. as I was leaving she said OP, I think we should break up I responded with I came here to break up with you. but we sat down and talked, and I see this little bit of strenght left, and I dont want to bail on it. I would like to go see a couples counciller she said fine I said ok, so, lets not break up just yet, we're still 'on a break' for a couple of weeks, I'll setup the appointment

the next couple of days we texted, and went to go see a movie. on the way to th movie we were texting each other and the last text she sent me contained the lines ...since we're not a couple anymore... which got me a bit angry. I asked a mutual friend who said she had confided in me that we had in fact, broken up.

GF, I walk away from this relationship with my head held high, knowing I did everything in my power to save it, but no matter what I did, it wouldn't have been good enough for you. I am not the one who was the problem. maybe one day after you stop being angry with me, you can read this book and maybe you will remember all the good times we had. We had a hell of a run.

I lack the eloquence to formulate a proper note. Can someone please help me?

Tomorrow I begin No Contact. not to save the relationship, but to try and get over her. I'm totally heartbroken.

976,1j2181,"After a lifetime of atheism/agnosticism, I became Catholic after we married. I agree with many of the Church's teachings, and I found it was both easy and comforting to share this faith with him. But there are some issues where I can't agree, like the Catholic teachings on homosexuality and same-sex marriage. I have been ignoring/saving these issues for last, knowing they could be deal-breakers.

Over the past few years I've come to realize that I let go of all my close friends because I was afraid of offending them with my new beliefs. I constantly censored myself to try to save my Catholic identity. I came to loathe myself for losing my exciting, magnetic personality. I have made some friends in the church, but I don't feel close to them, and I don't feel like I can share much with them.

My health deteriorated through the course of our marriage, and I found out this year that I have multiple sclerosis. It didn't take long to start questioning my faith. I've had a lot of time on my hands and I believe I've done a pretty extensive audit of my beliefs, my desires, and my personality.

I think that becoming Catholic really did help me stay afloat. Because of my illness, every day was a struggle, and the church and prayer routine kept me in place. I still say a rosary when I can't sleep or just need to calm my frantic brain. But I don't believe what the church teaches. I consider myself agnostic and morally good, but I can no longer see myself raising children in a church setting.

Over the years, our faith became such a central part of our marriage that I'm having trouble figuring out what's left now. I've been thinking that there are four main modes of connection/support: friendship, philosophy, sex, and stability. I think that two are great, but two are suffering. (Are there other modes that I am neglecting?)

Friendship: My husband is my best friend and my biggest supporter who helps me deal with all of my health and emotional issues. 

Financial stability: We've both grown in many ways, and he has built a career to support us, with insurance that is paying for my medication (which would cost nearly half of my yearly retail income).

Philosophy: Here we diverge. As I've mentioned, religion and self-censorship are big issues.
 
Which brings me to my biggest problem - Sex: My sex drive was fairly low for the past couple of years because of my depression and ill health. Now that I understand MS, I've been taking much better care of myself and my sex drive is back. Maybe out of control. We have been using NFP to avoid pregnancy, and when my sex drive was already low, this was not a problem. But now I have a healthy raging desire to have sex with my husband, but the main point of NFP is that you DO NOT have sex when the woman is fertile, which is when I am most desirous. This is driving me batshit insane, because basically I'm only allowed to have sex with my husband when I'm only sort-of into it.

I find myself fantasizing about tons of the men and women who I help at my job. I get to the point where I feel like I want to proposition the nearest person and head out for a quickie. And I try to be calm, but it must show, because I'm starting to get a lot of winks and attention when men are in the store without their wives/girlfriends.

I share everything with my husband. We've begun to discuss my loss of faith and my frustrations with not using contraception, but I've kept the cheating fantasies to myself for a month or two, hoping they would subside. This week it has only gotten worse. A few days ago, I had to leave work early in tears, so I scheduled an appointment with an MS psychologist, and when my husband got home, I told him everything.

I also told him that these things seem consistent with bipolar disorder, and I have a history of leaving relationships this way. I get depressed, then I get out of depression and become hypersexual, and then I sort out my problems with the relationship and get the hell out of it. I'm hesitant to call it a problem though, because it has saved me several times: it provided the confidence that I needed to leave a few relationships that were genuinely not good. But now I'm confused and terrified, because my husband is a wonderful, good, and amazing person, and I NEVER had any doubt about our marriage until I got MS and lost my faith.

I'm worried that we won't last without religion. And I'm worried that if we do last, he'll always be scared that I'm going to cheat. I'm worried that I can't agree with him on how to raise kids if we decide to have them. I'm worried that I'll lose respect for him because I think of faith as a fairy tale with strong placebo effect.

Since I haven't stayed in touch with my old secular friends, I'd feel like a dick calling them up to say, Hey, guess what, I have MS and I'm not really Catholic, can you talk to me about my problems? So I'm here on reddit looking for perspectives. Catholic, secular, married, single, divorced, whatever. Thanks for anything you've got.

18,1ybjfe,"So my girlfriend and I have been dating for just over a year, the majority of which has been long distance.  We live around 5 hours from each other, but I don't have a car at the moment, so we get to see each other around once a month if we're lucky.

I am absolutely in love with her, and we haven't been shy about our potential future plans together.  Unfortunately though, she has been out of school for 2 years, and I am still in school, with a year of grad school to go. Dealing with long distance isn't easy for her, just based on her personality, but for whatever reason it's a lot easier for me.  Making things tougher is that she hates her job and constantly talks about how I'm the one thing that makes her happy.

I recently had to choose between going to two pretty equivalent grad schools; one within 30-45 minutes of her, that just didn't feel right to me and was a bit more expensive, and the other that is 3 hours from where she lives, but that I always wanted to go to, and have been pressured by my family to attend.  After talking with her, my parents, anyone who would listen, I chose the school 3 hours away.  Admittedly though, I should have talked with her a lot longer before making the decision.  I feel like I kind of rushed myself into it, and I don't know if I made the right one.

So now we're fighting, she's mad at me, and deservedly so.  I basically kind of forced her into a bad situation.  She either has to stay with her shitty (her words) job at home and continue to do long-distance or break up with me, or move in with me when I go to school and find a new job, something that she said she was willing to do, but continues to have second thoughts about.  

I feel like a bad person for making this decision, especially when talking to her.  She had her hopes up that I would go to school near her, and I crushed them.  The last thing I want is for us to have to break up, but I understand that she isn't happy with the way things are turning out, and she can make her own decisions.

I want what's best for both of us, and I hate that my decision is what is coming between us.  What can I do to make this situation better?

Me and my first boyfriend have been broken up since early this year. His excuse was he loved me but couldn't be in a relationship anymore. In order to try and get myself together I initiated no contact, which he didn't like cause he still wanted to be friends.

Eventually we sort of became friends 2 months post breakup until I found out he had been repeatedly sleeping with someone, which really hurt me and I said I never wanted to hear from him again (I know I never should have broken no contact).

Over the summer and still presently he continuously stalks my tumblr where I post personal things and such. In July I decided to go on a date and said I was excited, which he then made posts where he bragged about all the times he lied to me and even confessed to cheating (also bragging about it).

Now the date I went on has since turned into a relationship and this new guy is really kind and sincere. However come the start of this semester my ex is still cyberstalking me and posting things like that moment where you have a better boyfriend than your ex has. His new boyfriend is the guy he's been sleeping with and cheated on me with.

I shouldn't let it get to me but it hurts. I really did love him at the time. Why does he revel in the fact he cheated, lied, and hurt me? Why does he still look at what I post daily? How could I have been so foolish during the relationship and believed he was sincere?

762,3cuu47,"Sorry for the novel, I have no one to vent to until I begin seeing my therapist so I wanted to try here. 

My girlfriend and I are great. We hangout all the time and are very affectionate, but something doesn't seem right in the bedroom sometimes I can't tell if it's just my insecurity coming out. Full disclosure, I'm 29 and we've been dating about 1 year. Before that I was in a 6 year long committed relationship, so my dating knowledge sucks. Some background, we're both in our twenties and very attractive, outgoing types. 

We definitely have sex. And we definitely have *amazing* sex sometimes, but sometimes I feel like she doesn't want me. I don't feel like she initiates the sex hardly ever, and often times is just playing along to humor me. I sometimes feel like I have to try a little too hard to get things going. The few times I've brought the issue up she says We have sex all the time, and I DO want you! What am I doing wrong? I would feel bad saying I just want her to be all over me sometimes and we end up in a fight. So I've avoided bringing it up since. It's just not often that she really wants it but when she does things are spectacular. 

I have a tendency to be pretty insecure or take things personally, but I want to make sure I satisfy her and that I'm enough. I know people typically have sex every day. I'd say we do 75% of the time. I let it bother me when I get denied, or when it just seems like time passes without any hint of sexual attraction. I don't just wanna be a cuddly teddy bear, I want to be lusted for and please her too. She recently had a super-hard work week and we didn't have any sex all week because she was tired, and I took it sooo badly, I felt so un-appealing to her.. I thought how could she go a week without it when I can barely go a day? doesn't she want me? ... I feel like I'm sitting here saying want meeeee! sometimes and it sucks. But then I start to think that I want it too much, that I'm placing too much value on it, using sex as validation, etc... Am I going crazy? 

I've let all this stress just spin out of control to the point that this is all I can think of. I won't be able to see a therapist (something new I've decided to try, finally).

769,2c0fb9,"Hi, so I've (18) been dating this girl (19) for the last 2 years, and I've known her for the last 3; but it feels like we've known each other for eons, we share all the same interests, we like the same music and we hold very similar views.  Falling in love with her was one of the greatest times of my life, and I honestly didn't really see how the relationship could end.

Until now of course.

I guess there have a been a few things that could have made me think it was coming -- we're both in school, and due to a 9 month long term relationship, this summer was a long, boring three months with nothing to do.  She was working a part time job at the Y, payments were far and few between.  I also have a job, but due to some shady business, work has been very hit or miss.  This has caused her to be upset -- we had so much planned, and this sudden lack of money (also, my car (the only car in the relationship)) broke down, leaving us without transport.  Most days were spent taking walks, watching movies and cuddling.  I knew that it was boring, but at the end of the summer we would be moving away from home into a new city (not together, but to attend the same school).  She blamed me for all of our problems though, despite both of not having much.  This started some fights (until recently we NEVER fought).

She also met a guy at work -- older, attractive, blah blah blah.  Also, this guy recently confessed his feelings for her.  I obviously felt threatened, as he was always texting her.  I also was suspicious that she never let me see any of the texts, and the few times that he would call her with me around she would leave the room to talk to him (something she usually wouldn't do).  Near the end of the relationship she would even stay out past midnight at his house, when all I was doing was trying to keep our relationship from falling apart.

That really brings me to the last part.  The way it felt near the end, she told me all the things wrong with the relationship, and I told her that I would make them better, and that I would try to improve and that we could make everything work, but the entire time it just felt like she didn't want to be fixed, she just wanted to tell me why she would be breaking up with me.

I know that it's my fault.  A lot of the things that we talked about were my fault --  I didn't prioritize her, I wasn't thoughtful, I wasn't appreciatve of her.  I just don't understand because all I want is to fix these things and make her happy; I was blind and couldn't see that I needed to do these things. 

When it happened she told me that she thought that it would be for the best, that we were young that she didn't want either of tied down.  I think she just means that for herself though, because everything that I want in the next few years of my life include her.


It's really hard for me.  I'm young and this is my first major girlfriend and she means everything to me.  There were so many things that I wanted to do with her and show her, and now I just feel hung out to dry.

I guess I'm just asking for help, from someone who has been there before.  I fucked up and the girl of my dreams got away.  I don't know what to do, if I should wallow, try to get her back, or whatever.  I still have her things in my house and honestly I can't look at them without crying (and honestly I never cry).

288,2gzkqj,"Well,  where to start.  Things have been off and on rocky with this girl since we started dating but it didn't stop me from falling completely in love with her.  I had finally gotten back on my feet after a serious military related accident nearly cost me my life.  After years of therapy I am now at the point where I am self sufficient and happy but I still struggle with bouts of PTSD and depression.

She is 4 years younger than me and comes from a family that is ultra conservative and really strict.  Even though she is in college they still pay her way so they expect her to live by their rigid guidelines or be disowned.  I knew this but continued to date her anyway.  She is smart and funny and very kindhearted and not at all of the same mindset as her parents.  It does add stress because I always feel like im doing something wrong just by sleeping over.

I have had many issues with her regarding alot of drama she has pulled into our relationship as well as some issues with her regarding boundaries of trust (talking with her ex regularly and well as telling elaborate lies about small miniscule things)  but we talked them out and we communicated effectively (or so I thought) and most of the issues we were having began to dissipate.  She stopped talking to her ex boyfriend regularly and though she still has high anxiety and emotional stress we work through it.

I love her and I think in her own mind she loves me too.  I told her everything about me,  My PTSD and what happened to me,  my insecurities and fears and over time she has done mostly the same with me.  I thought up until the incident at hand we really had a sacred bond.

My girlfriend lives with two girls (all three of their parents pay the rent)  They come from rich families and are pretty snobby and stuck up and are very much in the college party mode  but I have treated them with respect and kindness.  I clean up after myself and treat their home as if it would be my own.  

None of this has mattered however,  her roommates no matter what I do have had issues with me.  They tell my SO that im weird and I make them uncomfortable even though I haven't given them any reason to feel this in my own mind and never before has anyone accused me of making them feel strange or that I gave off weird vibes.

A few days ago they texted my girlfriend and called a house meeting.  Later that night my girlfriend comes over and tells me it was about me.  They tell my SO that I am no longer welcome in their home and that my PTSD makes them fear for their safety and that they dont want me around any longer.  They told my SO that if I come around again their parents will take further action against me. 

I am blown away and hurt.  My SO leads a heavy school schedule and we spend 90% of our time together at her place so this means I will barely be able to see her anymore.  I press her for answers as to why they feel the way they do and the truth comes out.  She has been running to them every time we have an argument and trash talks me.  She has told them all about my PTSD and some of my deepest personal issues and insecurities.  She has apparently been doing this for a long time.

I feel completely betrayed and it all suddenly makes sense as to why her roommates feel the way they do.   She has defamated my character and made me out to be some monster creep all the while to my face she tells me how wonderful I am and how happy I make her.  The worst part is that these girls aren't even her friends.  They are caddy mean spirited people that are nasty to my SO when it suits them.  Countless times she has come crying to me over how they treat her.

What do I do?  I told her I need a break to think about things and I have told her how hurt she has made me.  She has apologized over and over but I dont think she understands the gravity of what she has done.  She balances on the line between remorseful to defensive and I think she is trying to guilt me into feeling sorry for her about all of this,  she keeps saying how she doesnt deserve me and how she is a piece of shit, trying to coax me into comforting her.  

All I know is that im heartbroken, confused and angry.  Am I overreacting?  Is this something that I should consider forgiving and hoping it doesn't happen again?  Can she change or will she change?  I love her to death but I feel so embarrassed and ashamed..I dont think I could ever be intimate with her again.  Please give me some perspective.  I know that she does love me and she is freaking out just as much as me at the thought of losing what we have but I feel like you just dont do things like this to people you care about

1105,1u777w,"Okay, so my girlfriend (whom I will call 'Jane') and I have been together for more than three years now. I know, it sounds naïve and all of that, but I really love this girl. Everything is absolutely perfect. She's funny, gorgeous, smart, charming, sweet, everything. She's an absolutely amazing girlfriend. She's proven many many times that she is head-over-heals in love with me and completely committed to this relationship.


However, this is where the problem kicks in. We met online a few years ago when we were young(er) and more clueless, and we are separated by a few states. Her home life isn't the greatest and she'd get a lot of crap from friends and family if our whole relationship was revealed. A very small group of people have knowledge about us (we've kept it hush-hush, since her family is strongly against these kinds of relationships). As much as we love each other, Jane has never had a typical relationship. She has never been on a date, despite being insanely gorgeous and sweet. We will be going to college once we finish our senior year, but she wants to date like every other person does. She wants people to ask her out, talk to her friends about whom she's dating, go on dates. We both fully recognize that she shouldn't be dating other people just for the experience. 


It's not that Jane doesn't love me or hates our relationship. She has shown time after time that she absolutely loves me and wants to be with me, but she just wants to have that whole dating experience to have in front of her friends in family. Since I am unable to do things like take her on dates or hang out with her and her friends, she wants to have something like that until we're physically together. It's not entirely just the attention/showing off thing, though. Jane doesn't want to be the girl of her group that no guys like. She doesn't want her family to think that she's awkward around guys or just weird about those things. She wants to talk to her parents about me and clear it all up, but she'd be disowned if that happened. 


I know, the whole thing sounds silly and juvenile, but I love her and she loves me. I just need some advice for handling this entire situation. She can't really tell her parents or other people about me, but I'm not going to tell her that I'm going to dump her if she doesn't promise to not date and all that. It's the one flaw about my girlfriend. I know, it's childish and selfish, but she is an amazing girlfriend.

My bf and i have been a couple for a year now (long distance for half a year, seeing each other on weekends half a year, moved in together 6 weeks ago), have been friend for almost a decade before falling in love last summer. 


The thing is that i am currently writing on my final thesis for my studies and he is constanly stressig about it.. I don't have all the time in the world to spend with him, but when i look at him and he has such a sad expression on his face, then i just want to spend time with him and cheer him up.. Usually we always talk about what bothers us but yesterday he offered to just 'not talk about it until i finish my thesis'. I can't sleep, and can't even focus on the work now.. i know it will be over in just some days since it's the final phase, but it's killing me inside to see him be angry at me and not telling me the whole story. But then when we start talking about it it always ends up in a mess. Either me shouting, crying or running off (left last night after dinner angry for the university and said i would come back when i finished the thesis.. 4h later he came by to talk with me and we ended up walking home together.. we were both angry lying in bed and couldn't sleep).. needless to mention we haven't slept with each other in a while.. 


Also i am now afraid that we can't work together as a couple and i often have flashbacks of memories of my ex (he was very controlling, emotional abusive, telling me i was dumb/fat/lazy/ugly..., controling if i was allowed to sleep ect.).
Somehow this story with my ex is still bothering me.. last night my current bf told me i would finish the work a lot faster if i didn't sleep that much (fell asleep on the sofa last afternoon).. but on the other hand i can't think when I'm tired and i have the feeling that the thoughts about the relationship take up a lot more of my time and energy than does the sleep..


what should i do?? just write the thesis and solve that later? what's your opinion? do you think the reason can be unresolved things about my ex? have been afraid to get caught up in my memories for the first 3-4 months of the relationship, but my current bf was always so nice and caring and i had the feeling we could talk about everything and sort it out without fighting... and now I am behaving like this.. I seriously don't think it's his fault.. Any ideas on how i could change my behaviour without seeing a therapist? (have neither time nor money for that)

I got a job at a department store 6 months ago, and pretty much immediatly fell in love with a coworker the first time I spoke to her on a smoke-break. I know it sounds corny, but I have never felt such a strong attraction any woman ever as I do with her. I was suffering from depression when I met her, and within 2 months of our friendship, my depression was gone and I actually looked forward to going to work. We have heaps in common and I knew she felt the same way as me as our friendship developed more and more. The only problem is that she is married, and has been for 4 years. 

A couple of months ago, we met up at a park during our lunch break and just made out for half an hour. I knew it was wrong, but it just felt right. We have met up in different places pretty much every lunch break for the past couple of months to avoid suspicion from other workers. But a couple of days ago, I just cracked and told her straight up that I loved her, and that only being able to spend 30 minutes with her in secret once a day isn't enough for me. She reacted by telling me that she was sorry and left, and we didn't speak at all for the rest of the day at work. Yesterday she told me that it's for the best if we don't meet up at lunch, and she was really distant to me all day, and it all felt so awkward and it really upset me.

1177,2q1ihm,"Jen and I have been friends for about 4 years and lived together for the last two years of college (we just graduated in May). We became very good friends when we lived together and have the same core group of friends – who we both hang out with a few times a week. 


When living together, we got along great as friends (for the most part) and I loved having one of my best friends right down the hall from me. But her living habits drove me kind of crazy – never did dishes, bathroom was disgusting, there was just STUFF everywhere (I never knew someone could have so much stuff), she would leave wrappers to these little candies she ate EVERYWHERE. I’m not the cleanest person, but I really hate when things are dirty or cluttered.  


At the beginning of our senior year, Jen asked me what my plans for living arrangements after graduation were – we’re both from the area where our college is and wanted to stay close to the city. I told her my plan was to move home for a few months as I saved up money. I’m lucky enough to have parents who are more than happy to have me stay at home while I figure my life out, so was not about to pass up the opportunity to avoid paying rent for a time. Jen said she loved living with me and would want to continue living together if possible. At the time, I decided the conditions of having Jen as a roommate were tolerable if that meant I could still live with one of my best friends. So I told her I would also love to live with her again, but that I was going to move home for at least a few months to save up money. Jen said she understood and she would also move home for a while.


I should also add: Jen’s family is fairly well off. Her parents paid her tuition and rent, sent her an allowance every week, took her grocery shopping, bought her clothes, paid for gas – everything! So she’s never had to worry about money. She has a hefty savings account and still gets money from her parents now (even after graduating and starting a job). So money wasn’t an issue for her the way it was for me – I went to school on a scholarship, worked to pay for rent and food money, and took out loans for the cost of tuition that my scholarship didn’t cover.  It’s really important to me that I’m financially stable before I move out of my parents’ house. I don’t want to be rushed into it. 


After the conversation about living together after graduation, I started to get a lot more annoyed with her poor living habits. A fork left in the sink would make me irrationally angry and I would twitch at the sight of her putting shoes up on the furniture. I think in college, I knew living together was temporary and I wouldn’t have to deal with her mess after we moved out, which made everything a lot easier to put up with. But after agreeing to live together again I realized living in her mess would be my life indefinitely. And now, moving back home with my parents and not living with her has just been really great to be honest. Things are clean and tidy, the dishes in the dishwasher are properly washed, there is no longer moldy food in the fridge – it has been so refreshing. 


Combine that with the fact that our friendship has been a little rocky the past few months. Jen and I are in the same group of friends – maybe about 20 of us who went to school together and settled in the area. I started becoming much closer with another friend in our group, Rebecca, this past spring. I think Jen became jealous of my friendship with Rebecca 1) because I wasn’t hanging out with her as much and 2) because she’s also friends with Rebecca and was mad that I was becoming closer to Rebecca than she was. Things were really tense and weird between us for a while until finally I brought it up to her and we were able to talk everything out and clear the air. Things have been better since we talked, but I still feel like I’m walking on egg shells at times because I don’t know whether what I’m doing or saying will upset her. Jen can be very sensitive and easily offended – which I’m the opposite of, so sometimes I can be very unaware of when something upsets her. 


So where we stand now: we are both living at home. I have a pretty well paying job for the field I’m in, so have been able to save up a good bit of money already. Every month or so, Jen will ask me about my plan to move out – I have gotten more and more vague saying things like I still don’t have a sense of when I’ll be ready to move out or I’m not sure who I would want to live with or where yet. I also told her that she should move out of home whenever she’s ready to and not wait for me – and I said I don’t want to feel pressured to move out before I feel like I’ve saved up enough, so I won’t be leaving home until I decide for myself that I’m ready and she should do the same. In all these conversations she always agrees with me and says she doesn’t know either. My initial plan of attack was to play the waiting game and just hope that Jen would move out before me and I'd be able to tell her that I didn't want to move out yet -- but she's told me she would rather wait to live with friends than strangers and is fine with living at home as long as necessary.


Basically, I'm just looking for guidance on how to best approach the conversation I know I need to have with Jen (sooner rather than later). I want her to know that I still consider her one of my best friends, but just do not think I can handle living with her mess and the occasional feelings of resentment directed at me. With things being tense between us and Jen taking things very personally -- I just don't know how to even broach the subject let alone frame the conversation in a way that does not make her feel like I’m abandoning her as a friend. 


And on top of all of that, Rebecca and I have more recently talked about possibly living together too – which I know Jen would not be happy about. Would that be completely awful of me to tell Jen I'm not living with her, only to move in with our other very good mutual friend who Jen got mad at me for being better friends with?

He's now trying to come up with his own business which runs on a really cool idea and his primary incentive is to see it flourish so that he can obtain his sweet revenge.

Why am I telling you all of this? Because ever since he lost his job in December, things have been vastly different at home. We live in a rather comfortable house that we're being forced to sell to finance the business. At the end of March, we'll be moving out of the city. There has been constant financial tension in the house. My brother was spared of all the drama because he lives in a city miles away and he's working so he's quite alright.
I wasn't affected by it as such because I believed in my dad.

In January I log on to the computer to research for a project and I browse the history to search for something and lo and behold! all I can see are dating websites. At first I'm in denial but then it slowly makes sense. All these websites are visited at night when my dad likes to shut the door and work in his room. I click on one of them and my dad has a profile. A PAID profile. And this isn't dating. Its more of a casual sex website. He's been paying for all these sites at a time when he cant even afford to live in his home of 20 years.

Now I'm just really really affected by this. I can't concentrate on anything, my grades are going way below average and everytime my parents demand an explanation I dont know what to tell them.

My mom and I share an alrightish relationship. Not too close with her. She is ultra conservative and we dont see eye to eye on many occassions. I was molested twice and both my parents did nothing about it and told me to shut up.

I thought of telling her but she's very very very close to my dad's family. She is not attached to her own family. They kinda shunned her. She calls my paternal grandmother every night and my aunts (dad's sister and his sister in law) call my mom every week. Everyone from my dad's family loves her. They are all she has.


I can't tell my brother about it either. We're not very friendly. More like cordial strangers. He got away with a lot of shit when we were younger. Strangled me and mom let it off with the excuse of teenage blues. He's put me in a lot of trouble and I don't like the idea of depending on him.

I'm at an absolute loss. My finals are less than a month away. These exams determine what college I can get into and I just can't focus. I hate being mentally burdened with so much shit. All I can think of is why'd I have to fucking open the history tab in the first place. I was thinking of sending my mom an anonymous letter (yes I know its stupid, I'm 17 and my guilty pleasure is pretty little liars, whaddya expect?) HELP ME.

128,34m8o4,"This whole situation is so exhausting and outrageous. I joined a Christian school last year and, as someone bisexual, have been very cautious about who I come out to in that community. The number was up to three or four, and that was how I liked it. My then-boyfriend was one of the first people I've ever come out to, and he was so supportive and accepting then. It felt great. We encountered a lot of problems in our relationship later on, and after a little over a year together we broke up. I was so tired emotionally from the constant fighting that it was such a relief to have freedom again, but he was very upset over the breakup and continued to text me for weeks saying he loved me and asking personal, uncomfortable questions.

While this went on I was living my life, feeling great and enjoying my time being independent. I became closer with a more distant friend of mine (a girl) over about 3 weeks and we ended up kissing one night. Things went on, we developed feelings for each other and spent more time together. We had such a good time, we could just sit and talk and laugh for hours. We moved quickly, probably too quickly, and slept together after a relatively short period of time. All was well, everything was perfect. 

But then her ex found out. Me and the girl stopped spending time together out of both of our fear and out of her guilt. It hurts so much to not be able to be with her. We still like each other and want to be together so bad but now we have people actively seeking to fuck things up for us. 

Since her ex and mine had been (conveniently) hanging out quite a lot, my ex-boyfriend found out really soon afterwards. And he was furious. He had been asking me questions to do with whether I liked her or not, and I politely declined to answer as I didn't think it was any of his business. But now he knew. This was last week that he found out - on Monday. I found out that he was outing me to people on Thursday, telling people I slept with her and calling me a whore and disgusting. He's told five people so far. Only one has mentioned it to me, that's how I know. Three of them won't speak to me. These people were my good friends. I'm in shock, I still don't even know how to comprehend how angry I am. All I know is that I keep hearing who he's going to tell next. This is torturous and so scary, and I feel so alone. What can I do? I wanted to come out on my own terms, with the girl I like so much to support me. Now I can't have either of those things.

She's usually too tired, don't wanna make reservations because she feels like she wont fulfill them and so on. 

The last month got really bad. the intimate contact between us were dwindling to the point of not even kissing, which was yesterday. I met with her yesterday and talked things out, our frustrations and hers. the problems we've been facing, the stress. The fact that she lost her romantic feelings for me, while I still retain them to some degree.

I claim that its because of all the stress lately, we haven't been on our best side when we meet each other then and it can cause problems. She felt like it would be pointless trying, because it would feel like torture for the both of us trying to restore those feelings.

However, we did meet a compromise. I said we should have a friendship phase where we meet eachother as friends instead of trying to restore the relationship at a top notch quality honeymoon phrase. Basically build it up instead, and see if she feels anything. She was skeptical at first, but then said it was a good idea. Right now I'm really just scared of what is going to happen.

1068,2xdkd4,"  Sorry for how lengthy this will be. 

  My bf and I have had our fair share of problems and this new issue has become the last straw on the camel's back for me. 
  However to make sure I am not making a bigger issue of the situation than it has to be I wanted the general public's opinion. 
(side note- I do not want to end this relationship, there are many Pros to this relationship)

  About a year ago my bf (we will call him Bob) and I discovered a new restaurant.  The restaurant wasn't too far from our apartment so we frequented it quite often.  There was a woman that worked there that was always friendly with all the male customers that would come into the restaurant.  (let's call her Lin)
  She was from an Asian country (this point is relevant to the story)

  He went to the restaurant a few times without me and I started noticing that they had become friendlier to each other. She would come over each time we came to eat, say hi to me then turn her back to me and start talking to him.  She would giggle, touch his arm etc.. 

A little while later, I noticed they had become friends on facebook.  I mentioned to him that I found it odd that they were friends on facebook.  He said she sent him a request.  I found it odd she didn't send me one.  
Fast foreword again and he went on a vacation to the country she is from.  He sent her messages on facebook asking here where he should go in that country.  He has plenty of other friends that have been to that country/ are from the country. Life long and good friends.  I found it a little weird that he would reach out to her, when she herself hadn't been back for over 8 years.  

Fast foreword again and they suddenly had each others numbers.  We stopped going to that restaurant as much for unrelated reasons. However each time we did go there she was very friendly to him and basically ignored me, even when I attempted to befriend her. 
  She moved a month or so ago to a different state and we have come to the issue at hand.  Earlier this week he was in her state for work and ended up calling her and asking her to dinner.  They have never hung out here in our home state and I was a little perplexed that he would go out of his way to have dinner with her.  He has several friends in that state he could have had dinner with and was very busy with work.  I should note he did have another guy friend meet them but to me it seemed like his first priority was her. That last part was probably a biases on my part.   

 When I asked him what he did for dinner, he told me he had gone to dinner with her and another friend.  I told him that it made me uncomfortable given how friendly she was with him and how cold she was to me.  He thinks he did nothing wrong.  I think he encouraged her crush.  

Side notes: He has a history of encouraging crushes from girls and while that is happening he insists these girls are very good friends.  Then when it fizzles out for some reason he pretends he never called them good friends.  

So now I am at a fork in the path.  My heart says he will not think he did anything wrong by going to dinner.  Another part of me thinks I am over reacting, but I know that if the situation was reversed he would be just as uncomfortable as me.  And yet another part is just confused. 

So r/relationships what do you think?

336,2f5g7k,"I think it's gotten to that point where we both probably know we're not right for each other but he, especially, is in denial. We both love and care for each other but I feel like our paths are going in completely different directions. We have next to nothing in common and when I've voiced my concerns about not having anything to do together, he's promised to change, only to go back to his old ways after a week or so. It's only after a recent heavy conversation that he's started to try but I feel like it's too little too late.

When we first started dating, he had just gotten out of a relatively short term relationship. He was overweight, I was weird, both of us were outcasts. He is, so far, my only real relationship. He complained that I was hard to buy gifts for because I didn't wear typical girly jewelry. The first time he said I love you was after I showed him my boobs on webcam for the first time. Texts were frequent, sex life was great, I felt proud to be with him so we stuck it out. We were happy. (We spent Christmas that year with his family for half the day and he dropped me off at my parent's house for the second half. He didn't stay.) 

Two years in, he complained it was hard to find pictures of me without makeup on my own social media sites so he could show coworkers what his girlfriend actually looked like, despite the fact that I have a passion for performing and theatrics and currently work as a makeup artist. That hurt, I confronted him and he said I'm sorry, but I really don't care about makeup. I have no interest in it and I can't pretend to like it for you. When I asked him what he did like about me, he said the fact that I craft and make things, which I stopped doing before we started dating. Christmas that year was at his mother's. I didn't have my license, so I asked to be dropped back home to my family's house while he went to his father's house. He said he wouldn't be long, left me there and returned six hours later. I didn't see my family at all.

We just celebrated our third anniversary not long ago and I still feel like he doesn't value me. I'm still apparently hard to buy presents for. Either that or he just doesn't pay attention to me- I feel like he's buying gifts for the girl he wants me to be, not the girl I am. Perfumes that don't suit me, clothing I would never wear, snacks I don't like. He'll take me to see movies even though I've always gotten restless easily. I'll make suggestions for new cafes and restaurants I want to try and he'll refuse (or the last time we went, he ordered only water because nothing appealed to him.) A recent job opportunity came up in a different state and he flat out told me he'd break up with me because he didn't want to deal with an LDR, but following a heated discussion I didn't apply, then he then started to look for ways he could transfer. We nearly broke up about a month ago, but only when it reached near breaking point he's started to try and patch things up and keep it together.

I'm kind of sick of it because I feel like he's clinging on to me as a trophy or as a reminder to himself that he can get a girlfriend. But at the same time, it's almost like I've put in too much time and effort into this relationship to justify breaking up, but I know it has to happen if we each want to live the way we want to. He's the kind of person who plans his whole life out and doesn't consider the fact that things might not go the way they planned or the work he has to put in to things to make them work. I'm scared of his reaction and what he'll do if I decide to end it. How do I even go about approaching this especially since he's trying so hard *right now*?

887,3bd00b,"Hello. Me and my boyfriend, 22 and 24, have been together for a year and a half. When I first met him, I knew that he enjoyed games like League, Dota, Counter Strike, etc. He would play them quite often but it never really bugged me at the time because it never conflicted with anything and he always made time for me. Also when I met him, he was working over night at a gas station, taking bong rips twice every hour that Snoop himself would approve, and smoking cigarettes out the wazoo. He was also incredibly depressed and used this as a means to cope. He is insanely smart, so I didn't understand why he was working the graveyard shift at a gas station, but I didn't care because I really liked him.

Long story short, I helped him quit his job, and basically wrote up a great resume for him and applied for jobs for him day and night. At the same time, he quit smoking weed and cigarettes. I did everything I could for him. A thing that irked me during that time though was that instead of helping me apply for his jobs, he played games. And when I would ask him at the end of the day if he had applied to anything, he would get defensive and tell me that he had looked at a few Craigslist ads and whatnot. I kind of dismissed it because I just figured it was him still trying to acclimate to all the changes and that was his way of managing the stress, and I liked him enough to keep helping him through it. 

Fast forward a few months - he has a great normal job and everything is going great. Then he decides it's a good idea to bring back the weed. I have absolutely no qualms with weed at all, but due to the unhealthy history he's had with it, I was a bit nervous. He started a pretty mild routine and stuck with it, which I was happy about. But as soon as he started picking up again, I noticed some behaviors start to kick back up. He hasn't stopped playing League of Legends throughout all of this, but now he starts to start taking it really seriously. He plays hours on end, yelling at the screen, and it's ALL he talks about now a days. Every aspect of that game bleeds into his conversations with me, every other word is about it, and he makes references to it like it's his religion. It seems like unless it's about League, we have nothing to talk about anymore. It got to one point that he started crying after a game and he constantly stormed out of the apartment after games. He smoked the weed in the bathroom and the smell started to seep out into the bedroom which stuck to everything and gave me a headache, so I asked him to take some steps to maybe lessen the smell when he comes out like wash his hands or something, and he acted like it was such an inconvenience to him. 

Well fast forward to a month and a half ago. His job got suddenly cut short. Because he needed to get a new job, he quit smoking the weed in order to pass the upcoming drug tests. Well it's been hell. Because he can't smoke weed, he now smokes cigarettes to supplement the cravings. If it's not one thing, it's something else. He keeps telling me that it'll only be for 1 more week, but he's making no effort to stop. The smell is awful, it gets on everything, and I don't even want to go near him anymore. I've supported him so much through all of this and once again, I've made up his resume and have done so much for him, but he refuses to take initiative and do anything for himself. If I ask him to wash his hands after he smokes or if I spray air freshener, he gets this disgusted look on his face and acts like I'm insulting him. I've gotten to the point where I've broken down and cried and told him how much I hated the smoke and constant headaches I get, and he says oh I'll try to change, but yet, nothing has. He talks about League of Legends and Dota constantly now. Everything revolves around it.

I just don't know what to do anymore. On one side of him, he's this loving, caring boyfriend who is sweet and devoted, but this other side of him is addictive and terse. I feel guilty because the words pathetic and disgusting and repulsive have started to penetrate my thoughts when I think about him. I don't want to hug him or kiss him anymore because he refuses to brush his teeth after he smokes and he reeks of smoke, I feel like I can't have a conversation with him anymore because I feel like it'll either be about League of Legends or him getting terse with me because he doesn't want to deal with things going on in reality, and most of all, I'm feeling like I'm getting apathetic about our relationship because I feel like if anything needs to get done, I have to be the one to do it and it just feels like I'm carrying him on my back. I love him but I'm not sure what to do. I feel like I'm nearing the end of my rope and I don't want to get to that point...

302,2mscr9,"So I don't really know the purpose here as I think I know the advice I will receive. Anyway I met this girl last spring and we began texting/hanging out/hooking up, while both agreeing we wanted nothing serious.

 After about a month of this she went and studied abroad in Europe for 6 weeks. I had known about this for a while and assumed that would be the end of our fling. We ended up continuing to talk while she was there and missed each other so we starting sending pics and texting. 

Well obviously when she got back there was a lot of pent up emotions so we had some pretty passionate sex over the course of the first weekend. After that I noticed her definitely starting to like me. She always wanted to hang out and I would sometimes even make excuses for 3/4 days straight before hanging out on the 5th.

Anyway it was then I started realizing what was happening and suggested stopping before one of us got hurt. As expected, this ended up hurting her feelings but not as bad as it would've in a couple months I hoped. I was trying to do the right thing, but she convinced me that she wasn't hurt, didn't want an LTR either and thought we should keep hooking up because we both enjoyed it.

So we did... Now the truth is she's a super nice, sweet girl who I am definitely physically attracted to. However I don't find her as attractive as past ex's, think our personalities are extremely different and most important I don't feel the butterflies I remember from other girls I've been in love with.

This weekend however we were texting and she told me she basically liked someone and they started talking recently. Now I didn't see a long term future with this girl, basically tried to break up with her and now this happens so it should be no big deal.

But it is, it really bothers me. They were hanging out last night and she didn't respond to a few texts. I'm like a wreck at work today, looking at her fbook and snapchat, etc. WTF is wrong with me? I seriously feel like a psycho with these polar opposite feelings. Is this normal? Am I making a mistake or doing the right thing? Really just confused right now...

431,2ylnez,"This was my first real relationship, my longest and most meaningful. I broke up with her once, three months into the relationship. Due to the fact that she was not comfortable with doing anything besides kissing, and I was looking for something more. From the beginning she sort of led me on and made up excuses for why she wouldn't do anything besides kiss. Breaking up with her that time was entirely painful and I found myself crying for the first time in years. I knew I'd made a mistake and was crushed. We ended up talking it over the next day and I apologized for giving up. In the end we decided to move forward.


For the next 6 or 7 months I was fully enjoying our relationship. I can say that I loved this girl, and I did my best to treat her well and make sure she was happy. We both go to college and work, but spent no more than one or two days apart from each-other. We would take turns sleeping over each others house, considering we did not live together. The holidays were amazing, I can say I was entirely happy. Our sex life had improved tremendously since our first break up and I wanted to be with this girl forever. 


Just to note, she gave up doing psychedelics because I told her it made me uncomfortable and would prefer if she didn't do them. I gave up cigarettes because she didn't like me smoking them. She was also a chronic texter, wanting to pretty much text throughout the day constantly which I did not enjoy but to me it wasn't a big deal.


The past month and a half have not been easy, during this time I started to become disenchanted with our relationship. I found that there were things that I wanted to be doing that I was failing to do. In the time of our relationship I had stopped working out, and falling out of shape. I tried to get her to come work out with me but she was not for that lifestyle. I never once blamed her for me not going to the gym, but I felt that I was not balancing my personal goals and my relationship. In the month of February I tried my best to sort of spend more time working out, reading, and doing school work. I found this was not easy because she always want me to be over her house or to be at mine, and if I was going to the gym she would try to convince me to hang out with her instead. I started seeing faults in her that never bothered me before. The fact that she never wanted to try many new things. She also had a problem drinking around me. She would hang with her friends one night and talk about all the drinking they did, but if i offered to have some drinks and hang out she would always decline and say that I could drink but she didn't want to. I just wanted to relax and have a drink or two with my girlfriend but she wasn't okay with that. She was a bit clutsy and would hurt herself anywhere between 5-6 times in a night of hanging out. If she bent her fingernail and said oww and I didn't immediately ask her if everything is okay, she would get upset with me and say I guess you don't care about me and sort of give me the cold shoulder until I said sorry and found out how she hurt herself.


Besides the fact that I was now seeing things about her that I didn't exactly enjoy, I was failing to do the things that I knew would help make me a better, happier person. I also in this time became less attracted to her physically, I don't know why that happened but I think it was all in my head. 


I thought it over for the beginning of March, and decided that if I wanted to work on my happiness and become a better person that I should break things off with her. This was the moment when I decided that she wasn't my soulmate, and it wasn't fair for either of us to continue on. I don't regret a minute of the amazing time I spent with her, I learned so much about her and myself. We had some seriously happy nights. 

During our  routine texting she asked me if everything was okay because my texts seemed to have less emotion. I told her everything was gonna be okay, but I wanted to meet up with her to talk. She asked if I was gonna break up with her. I again insisted that I wanted to see her in person and that I thought that might be best for us. She took it surprisingly well all things considered, said she knew I couldn't force myself to have feelings for her and that it was okay. I'm sure she broke down and was crying, that obviously doesn't translate into text.. She also told me she still wants to be friends with me after some time. The first time I broke up with her it happened in person and she broke down, it made me feel terrible and I'm sure this time was worse..


So here we are on. This is day one of being single. And I'm extremely sad. I cried for a bit last night and wrote a letter I intend to give her when we meet to exchange our stuff. I can't stop thinking about it, my mind says its for the best. But my heart keeps telling me that she loved me more than anyone ever has and that I've thrown it all away for nothing. This type of pain is the worst thing I've ever felt. My heart is broken, and its all my fault. Maybe this is for the best and I will be able to power through this and feel better. Or maybe I've lost the love of my life because of my decision. All I want to do is tell her I'm sorry. I would never expect her to get back together with me, nor would I have the audacity to ask. I know she is in pain too, and she doesn't deserve it at all. I hope we will end up friends at least..

He is a good guy. I am getting to the point in my life where I want more commitment, I think we should be talking more about our relationship and where it is going etc etc... finally mustered up the courage to talk to him and moral of the story is he isn't ready for that.

I have a hard time with it bc im left wondering why doesn't he want to be closer to me? He said MAYBE in a year we can talk about moving in together. Problem is he equates this to moving towards marriage while I on the other hand wouldn't think of marrying someone until after I've lived with them. So not too sure how that will work...

1021,3ccjgg,"Bf is in grad school, and suffers from depression. He's been on meds (just over 2 weeks) and talk therapy. He also suffers from low self confidence, self doubt, and numerous insecurities.

We live together. 

I love him very much. He is one of my best friends, we have amazing sex, he respects my race and culture, we have many shared values, I love his family and they love me. We both talked about how we had a solid relationship. Made plans for the future including moving to a new city and getting married in a few years.

I got back from a 2 week trip in May and my bf was different. He didn't want to talk about our future together (moving to a new city, getting engaged in a year or 2, etc). I thought we were on the same page about these things especially because he frequently initiated these conversations and we were always in agreement. 

He said he didn't remember these conversations (at least 4 major ones, and numerous casual ones over the past 8 months or so). He later said that he did remember the conversations but didn't take them seriously since he thought we were just dreaming. He dismissed my feelings: you're doing this thing that women do at your age. The feminist in me wanted to smack him silly but physical abuse isn't my thing. He is being an asshole. He made me feel guilty for wanting what I wanted. Despite him leading me on by telling me he wanted these things too. Some of his family and friends he has talked to have indirectly made me feel guilty for siding with him, and never attempt to hold him responsible for his immaturity, and for lying and betraying his partners trust. He has since apologized and continues to do so.

He said long term planning seems difficult because he was focusing all his energy on completing his thesis. This left me confused because he's been in grad school throughout our relationship and was able to do long term planning.  I was more confused because he always told me that I was good at shorter term stuff and he is a long term planner. Most of our longterm planning conversations were initiated by him, regularly too. I thought we were on the same page because he made me believe this and also initiated many of these conversations.

I was hurt and felt very betrayed. When I tell my partner what I want for my future, I expect to be taken seriously. Even more so when the other partner says I want all these things too at the same time. I expect a yes to mean yes, and the expectation of communication if either party felt differently.

He said (in May) he doesn't think we're right for each other. This happened after I asked him some tough questions about his decreasing level of commitment. He said it's just a feeling of doubt that it may not work out, which he's trying to work through Isn't this life in general? You try something, it may not work out?

He didn't tell me anything I can do to make our relationship better. He says I'm meeting all his needs. A few days ago, he says he knows we are right for each other but is struggling with finding clarity in life and struggling with a lot of self doubt. He sees me in his future but doesnt know what his future looks like. When he tries talking about our future together, he looks physically uncomfortable.

He says he's long term committed to me and wants to show me this. He says it's hard for him to envision and plan the future when he feels extremely negative right now. This leaves me confused because he has gone through numerous depressive episodes and his commitment didn't waver then. He's never had clarity or super positive about his future and was still able to commit.

Since May, I have felt a lot of anxiety and invested a lot of energy trying to fix a relationship that previously didn't need any fixing. I don't think I have done anything wrong. The problem is HIM! I have upgraded this man's life in multiple ways. His mom and friends have noticed his transformation since we started dating and and thank me. Yet, this back and forth is threatening our relationship when it doesn't have to be that way. 

I asked him what he learnt from his 3 previous relationships which ended because he couldn't get his act together. He said he learnt not to take love for granted. Well, he's doing the same thing again. He is trying to beat depression but I don't see him actively trying to break old relationship patterns. 

To make matters worse, we may have to move out of our apartment soon, and this morning, he casually suggested not living together anymore because it may be better that way. This really hurt because last night, we talked about how our relationship was feeling better and how living together has been working out and is good for us.

This back and forth is killing me. I have told him that I'm giving him a few weeks to get his shit together or I'm out. I wanted to wait till the end of the summer, but that is too agonizing.  

Thing is, I don't know how he can convince me that he can an adult capable of making life plans and following through. He can say it, but his actions haven't matched his words recently. I don't want to be in the same place a year from now. We all have questions about our life purpose, but it shouldn't have to cripple us with fear and make us incapable of committing.

Btw, I plan to share this thread with him. At the suggestion of our therapist, we are taking a break from couples counselling to do a few sessions of only individual counselling.

Anyone have experience with this? How does an insecure person with low self confidence and a lot of self doubt commit and follow through? Is this even possible?

505,21srja,"We've been together almost 2 years now. Friends for years before we hooked up randomly, and have been inseparable ever since. Everything was so easy at first. I never knew dating a friend would be that easy, like dating your best friend. 

But lately things have been going south, for the past two months. It started with some harassment from his ex to me (she's also got some mental illness stuff to deal with too). She's been harassing me on tumblr periodically since the beginning of our relationship. She leaves me mean messages anonymously, and I knew for sure it was her when she messaged me the day after my bf blocked her on Instagram. Pretty much a month after that she does it again, and on this particular day I happen to be extremely hungover so my patience and desire to deal with bs is just unnaturally low. So I go to her tumblr and message her. And my bf decided then to call her and tell her to ignore me. And he lied to me about that. I found out he lied because his ex replied back to me and told me. 

After finding out he lied to me, I get really upset. I have a pretty black and white view when it comes to lying because I'd rather deal with complete honesty. Our relationship was built on trust. I was seeing other guys when we first hooked up and I always told him because I didn't want to be lying to him. I expected the same treatment back. He says he lied to me because I was being immature and I couldn't handle the truth, and I just don't see any justifiable excuse for lying to me. Every time we tried to talk through this, we both were very stubborn about our points of view and neither of us were willing to budge. Now, naturally, I feel betrayed. And now I'm wondering if he so easily lied to me about this, then what else could he keep from me? He's never given me a reason not to trust him before this. And prior, I would never even have believed that he could. But he did. 

After this whole fiasco with the ex, we continue to work on our relationship. We have a couple huge fights, which leads me to where I am now basically. Now my bf has never kept it a secret that he's bipolar. I've known it for years so it was not like I didn't know what I was getting into. But it's hard. He gets mad at me so easily. And I'm a really sensitive person, so I end up crying a lot. He's mean and then he gets really depressed and I have no idea what to do or how to help. And it's all just taking a toll on me now. I'm not all together myself. I am a masochist and I need pain to keep me level headed, but I stopped seeing the guys I was seeing in the beginning of our relationship because I was sick of hurting my bf. I hated hurting him. But in the months since then, I have lost my shit. Most days I'm okay, but I have my bad weeks. It started out as a month, but I've been slowly getting better. I probably need to go to therapy too. But I'm not getting my healthy dose of pain, which means that I am taking it and pushing it in ways that are unhealthy for me. He gets mad and he yells at me, and I push it to keep it going, so I can reflect and be sad because I need to feel something. Pain is a reminder that I'm human, that I hurt people as much as I am hurt. It keeps me grounded. But since I'm not getting it in the ways I want, I drown myself in whatever pain he throws at me. 

We've been fighting so much lately that I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm not sure if it's worth it for me to try. I feel like I've done so much and I'm still waiting to get my needs taken care of. I know he's working a lot in a very stressful environment (he's a cook). I know he's trying to get his career started and to get his stuff straightened out. But I have needs that are not being met and I can't control my moods when I'm not getting it. I love him. But every time I try to look at this while sober, I feel like maybe we should part ways. But it's like, he loves me a lot. I know that. And I know that if I stayed with him I would never need to worry about another woman coming in and ruining everything I've built. I've been pushing for him to see a therapist since January and he hasn't. I don't think he wants to. Even though after most of our big fights he comes to a realization that he probably should. I am constantly telling him that I can't help him properly because I haven't been trained to deal with mental illnesses. 

I'm starting to lose hope. My friends are telling me to break up with him, that they hate seeing me cry over him, and they hate the way he yells at me. And I know I sound like those girls in abusive relationships when I say, when it's good, it's really good. He's in one of his depressive states. I don't know how to deal with it anymore. He's just drinking liquor all the time and coming home to me wasted. I don't know what I can do besides save myself and take myself out of the picture. But I care about him so much. The idea of leaving him hurts me.

Boyfriend is bipolar. We've been fighting a lot lately. He's in a depressive state and I am so worn out from all the fighting that I just don't know how to deal anymore.

Now everything's been fantastic. Although I can only see her on the weekends (we go to different colleges) we spend as much time together as possible and enjoy each other's company


Now I'm about to graduate college and take a year break before going to get my masters in psychology and she's still in school right now.

136,37alwy,"Well, this seems like a dumb question, but I can't say I've really been in a situation like this before.

Anyway, last July at work, I met a girl who kind of fell in love with me. She had moved to where I am for a boyfriend to try and salvage a 4 year relationship, but ended it pretty much as soon as she got here. I'm pretty sure my existence was the catalyst for that.

At first, we were just friends for several months and often hung out together with my roommate as we were the only ones from the office who lived in a certain nearby city and didn't know anyone else (only moved here a few months earlier). I was already in a relationship, but that ended last September.

As time went on, I kind of found myself enamoured by her too, and she finally admitted to me that she liked me around October. However, she's very religious (non-denominational Christian) and said we couldn't be together because of some random rules in the Bible or something. However, I guess her feelings overruled that, because she changed her mind a few days later and said it would be okay to try a short term thing.

So we did that, and she was very shy about getting physical. That shyness wore off pretty fast, and we were doing pretty much everything couples do besides having sex (sex before marriage was a huge 'no' for her). I don't know why, but I began having mixed feelings after a while. Like was I only attracted to her because she's so attracted to me? I don't know.

I tried to break it off several times, and she was okay with it each time. Later I learned she would go home and cry about it each time. It got to the point where I said maybe it's better we don't talk to each other for a while to let her feelings kinda die off. We tried, but she kinda kept coming back. Working together doesn't make that very feasible.

Eventually we gave up on that and decided we could just be friends if we try. However, that was doomed to failure. She was still taking every opportunity to see me and things started getting kinda physical again without either of us really saying anything. When spoken, we were just friends, but obviously, we were going pretty far beyond what's normal for friends. She was getting more open to things that are more in the realm of sex (oral sex. etc).

So eventually people at work start noticing her interacting with me unprompted and we became the topic of gossip. At our last work retreat in April, our coworkers had a plan to try to get both of us drunk to see what would happen. It failed (I'm amazed at the level of immaturity in a professional workplace sometimes...).

Fast forward to today, random sleep overs and things keep happening here and there without either of us asking about what our situation is now. My family recently met her when they came to visit me from out of the country (she came out to dinner with us and my roommate), and they love her and always ask about her; of course constantly asking the question, is she your girlfriend?

Anyway, just yesterday things got really physical and we ended up having sex, even after I asked her multiple times if she was for sure okay with it.

Now some backstory about myself; I've only had a single long-term relationship and it didn't end well. That was about 3 years ago. I've had several short-term things and dated a lot since then, but I usually end it (if the girl doesn't first) because of a random constant what if there is someone better for me out there? kind of feeling. That feeling is reinforced by stupid superficial things that subtly bother me (level of fitness, clothing, hair, etc). I try to convince myself otherwise, but it always ends up ultimately guiding my decision in the end.

While seeing this girl mentioned in the story, I've been dating around and slept with two other girls. One of them she actually met (accidentally) and was rather upset about it for obvious reasons.

I blame myself for things getting physical, but it's hard when you're a young guy and a girl is kind of throwing herself at you and not stopping any advances.

So now I'm left with two options; do I put my foot down and say no, no more of this (easier said than done), or do I make this girl my girlfriend? I'm sure the former sounds like the obvious choice, but maybe deep down I'm just afraid of having a relationship because of what happened with my last long-term one. Maybe the what if there is someone better is something I'll always feel meaning I might as well just make a decision now and learn to appreciate it later. That's how arranged marriages work, right?

Anyway, just looking for advice here. Obviously, I don't want to hurt this girl by leading her on, since she's my friend, but I also don't want to shoot down something that could be right just because of a potentially unsatisfiable feeling.

My girlfriend and I are both in college and have been dating for two years. We go to school in a different state than where our families live (or where hers used to). Back in January, her mom decided that she was unhappy where she was living, and pretty much guilted my girlfriend into letting her and her brother move in with her out at school because she wasnt happy where she was (forcing my girlfriend to live in a one bedroom apartment with the two of them, and uprooting her 15 year old brothers life). 

My girlfriend is financially independent and works a full time job while taking 18 credits at school. The area is very expensive, and her mom made her pay and live in a one bedroom apartment without a roommate for 6 months while she prepared to move out there. Which is draining when it costs $1600 a month.

My girlfriend is big on pride and has a soft spot for her family (who doesnt?) and for the longest time just kept saying her mom deserved to be happy and that she would do whatever it took to help her out.

I grew up with both my parents being together and we were financially stable, so at first i empathized that her family may be a little more close knit and OK with this situation. While neither of us were happy about it, we figured it would only last a month or two while her mom got on her feet.

Needless to say, its been about 8 months, and my girlfriend is still paying all of the rent, bills, etc. She makes close to $4,000 a month, and never has any money because her mom considers it hers and guilt trips her into paying bills. Her mom acts like a child, gets piss drunk every once in awhile, and can be verbally abusive. Pulls the card of you know how much I have done for you? and you cant do x and y for me? that kind of bullshit.

 To be honest, her mom can't afford to live there, and is dragging her  down with her. My girlfriend is aspiring to go to a prestigious school and pay for it herself, and that is going to be hard enough as is without dealing with this bullshit.

The same kind of stuff has been happening for probably a little over a year. Her mom is ungrateful, delusional and manipulative. She plays on the card of all she has done for my girlfriend raising her, and since she doesnt have a great relationship with her dad, she clings to her mom and puts up with this stuff. 

Frankly, I have told her that if she doesnt stand up to her mom, she will not be able to pursue her dreams. Other than that, I have tried to tread lightly on the subject because technically its not my family. However, I have always been there for her when they havent, and help to get her the little things cause she spends all of her money on them.

Im starting to grow resentful because she complains about the issues but wont do anything about it. I can only empathize for so long, before it becomes her fault for not standing up to her. As well our sex life has suffered because we are already long distance, so whenever I see her we cant be intimate or have time alone. I feel as if I am being taken for granted, and treated secondary to them in this situation, despite her mom and brother treating her like shit on a regular basis and me always being there for her.

I almost feel like if I am putting in the time, effort and money, my opinion should be valued more, and I shouldn't be blindly put behind her family in every situation. I care about her and love her with all my heart, but I feel like I cant put up with this shit forever or it will bring me down too. I feel bad that her mom is putting her in this position, but at this point I think she kinda just needs to let her mom sink or swim and do her own thing (its not like her mom would end up on the street if she took this approach).

Does anyone have advice on how to approach this? I don't want to come off as trying to separate her from her family, but I can see how destructive they are to her life. I just think she needs to stand up for herself and do her thing, even if that doesnt enable her mom to do what she wants to do.

I moved to university and met a girl who was studying my course from abroad. She is here for the 3 years and I have never met anyone like her. I could go into the details but all I need to say is she is amazing to me.
The problem is the relationship was built from a mess. When we met I was getting over a uni caused long distance break up and found solace in her kindness, unparalleled purity and happiness only to continue to ruin the blossoming friendship and attachment on 4 occasions by sleeping with people on nights out. It wasn't cheating as we weren't together but emotionally I was doing that to her.
We would fight as I would go back to her every time with my tail between my legs and apologies on my tongue and she would take me back every time. 
I eventually sorted my life out and gave her what she deserved, my unparalleled attention and my word that there was nobody else.
Over the time there was always people against us due to my past and it was a constant battle for us to stay together. We finally got past that point a few months back when her friends came to trust and understand me.
Just over a week ago we had our first real argument and it was the straw that broke the camels back. After over a year of battling she had had enough. 
I can be negative quite often with my working class Middle English ways and this can lead to me being selfish and unkind. I don't make her happy anymore but she does still like me and want to be with me but I have put her to a point where the relationship isn't what she wants anymore.
Admittedly I am terrified, my attitude needs to change and I know that but I spend every second imagining her with anyone else and it makes me sick. She makes me the person I know in my mind I want to be and feel totally lost without her. 
My relationships have been bad and have ended so in the past. But I can't give up on this yet. 
My question is how can I show someone all the reasons why they should be with me when they want space and distance. I still see her but shouldn't smother her.

662,3crchb,"So, as the title said, I had an affair with a student. Here is the context: 

I moved to a new town to start at a new school at the beginning of last semester (December). I made an online dating account because I wanted to start meeting women and maybe start a new life in this place. I went on a few dates here and there and nothing stuck, but one of them I did sleep with. She did tell me she was a student,  but I was under the impression that if she wasn't MY student, then it was okay. I know, I should have checked. WE had sex on the first date, and then about a week later I decided to look into the rules behind dating students, and found that I could lose my job. I immediately ended it, telling her that my job is my top priority.

She did not take it well... She said that she knew the rules and thought that because I had sex with her, I was okay with breaking them. I explained that wasn't the case and she accused me of lying and using this as an excuse to sleep with her once and then dump her, which is absolutely not the case. She cried, and I had no idea what to do. I knew that if I tried to comfort her (hug her, put my arm around her} it could be taken as affection. We left the situation pretty badly with her yelling at me and calling be a fucking ass hole.

She still won't leave me alone. She shows up at my office when she knows I will be there (my schedule is online). The first time it happened she acted completely normal, and she was very flirty and sweet. I didn't react to any of her flirting, and kept telling her it was inappropriate for her to be there. Eventually she said I have some balls being this rude to me. I could turn you in, you know. I got a bit angry at the threat and told her I would call campus police if she didn't leave, which I now know was a mistake... 

That was last week, and since then she has shown up at my office 3 times and called/texted me around 100 times. I have ignored everything. 

At this point I am terrified. I would hate to lose this job because of a stupid mistake I made, but I am almost to the point of accepting that it will happen if she is really going to go through with reporting me. 

Has anyone been in this situation? Any advice at this point would be amazing. Thanks for reading.

Both of us had children from a previous marriage. Both our marriages ended badly. I'd say we both still carry some scars from that. We've been together just over 3 yrs.

We also have a surprise baby together. If it wasn't for her we probably wouldn't be together, but after having one divorce I would do almost anything to keep the family together.

I did try to break things off before the baby came along, and when we eventually got back together the relationship wasn't the same. He doesn't talk to me or treat me like a friend, no matter how much I have tried to apologize and be there for him. He just isn't around. 

He barely communicates but he's sending such mixed signals I don't know what is going on. Lately he acts like he can't stand me half the time. But he's also started initiating sex at least once a day where as for the past year or so he barely would let me touch him.

Yesterday morning, after waking me up for sex TWICE in the night, we got in an argument about the kids and he calmly looked in my eyes and said I completely and totally hate every single thing about you. 
Then he told me I should move out and we'd figure out custody in court. He packed a bag while WHISTLING and said he'd be gone all weekend.

 Didn't speak to me all day, then he shows up at 7 with the babysitter so we could go to a show we had tickets for. We didn't really speak but he did buy me a beer. 

I had to leave before he got up this morning but I texted him, saying what's going on, can we talk? I haven't heard back. 

Is this what hatred looks like? Why all the sex suddenly? He has a lot of stress with work and money lately but he also gets to come and go as he pleases and doesn't have to worry about home or the kids or me nagging him about it, ever. 

He makes me feel like a horrible person when all I want is to make him happy and be happy. Someone tell me how to break through!

edit: He just brought me a sandwich and we talked. He's under a lot of stress... It's hard for both of us to let our guard down at this point.

However, over the past year, her eating habits have gotten horrible and she has cut any and all aspects of working out from her life completely, not that she ever really excersized all that much before, but also wasn't eating an entire Costco sized bag of chips a night and chasing it with three Mountain Dews before either.  In the past year, she has probably put on thirty to forty pounds.  Before you ask if she's depressed or stressed or anything, we are at a high-point in our lives right now - both of us are making good livings, we have a great group of friends, an active and healthy sex life, and things we rarely ever argue or fight, so I really don't think that has anything to do with it, not to mention we're big on communication and share everything, so I would hope that I'd know if she's depressed.


Anyhow, I don't even mind the weight-gain so much if she's happy, but it's when she asks the question, Do I look fat?

After our third date, he said that he really liked me and he was on board for whatever I was ready for, whether I wanted to take it slow or get exclusive. I told him that I wanted to take it slow, and he was fine with that. I'm not seeing anyone else at the moment, but I didn't want to get serious again so soon.

But sometimes when Frank cuddles me or strokes my hair, I get this involuntary memory of my ex doing the same thing.

But it makes me sad and anxious when these memories pop up, even though they were good memories. Like, even though our relationship was shitty overall, I still kind of miss the good times. It makes me withdraw a bit from Frank too. He's really respectful of my boundaries and space, so he takes this all in stride, but I feel terrible about it all, and incredibly guilty.

59,1i2a27,"My cousin (lets call her J) lost her 16yr old son 3 years ago to suicide. She has been in so much pain since, but all my family have been supportive and caring towards her. 

She came out as gay around 15 years ago and has since started dating women, a subject none of my family have an issue with at all. My mum (48F) grew up with J and was less of an auntie and more of a friend to her. They lived together for years when my older brother and I were younger and when her kids were babies. 

When her son died, my mum took charge of the funeral planning and helped arrange a lot of things; wake, food, invitations, collecting money from the family. She was just looking out for a loved one as anyone would do. 

Recently J started a relationship with a lovely lady and moved about 30 miles away to a small town. She started to become more and more withdrawn and reclusive, she doesn't even leave her house anymore. 

She's incredibly depressed and obviously heartbroken. I know she's lonely too and we often ask if she would like us to come down and visit, she always refuses. I try to pop up to her on Facebook chat to see how she's doing, my Mum frequently does too. 

I have reason to believe she's being fed nasty lies about my Mum and I honestly don't know what to do about it. My Mum was speaking to her on Facebook chat earlier when she asked me if I thought everything was alright with her. She showed me the messages and I could see that J was being very blunt and 'off', it was out of her character. 

My mum asked her again if she would like to come and visit some time and she said she doesn't want to see her, after what she said. 
Turns out someone had told J that around 13 years ago at a family christening, my Mum was making homophobic remarks about J. **This is completely out of my Mum's character** she just would not do a thing like that, especially considering the fact my own brother is gay. 

J then said she wouldn't like to speak to my Mum again and she was glad that she didn't have to, she then blocked her from Facebook. Obviously my Mum was really upset about it because she knew that there was nothing she could do, however she knew exactly who was behind the lies. 

Her own cousins were the ones who had the party in question where my mum was apparently homophobic. Recently, my Mum had to message one of her cousins asking her to be a little bit more careful about what she says to J. 

For instance, J would write a status about how bad she was feeling, then my Mum's cousin would comment on the status agreeing on how shit and awful and terrible life is, this is a CONSTANT thing. She is just one of the types who love to wallow in grief even though her life is good. It's not the type of thing J, an actual grieving mother needs to be told every time she writes a status. 

My Mum basically asked her to try and cheer J up instead and make her realise life isn't always terrible.

Coincidentally, a few weeks after and my Mum is being accused of homophobia. Before anyone says I may be jumping the gun, this woman has spread similar lies before, she just isn't a nice person.

So I've been with my GF for more than three years now. We get along well, but we struggle often because we do not share the same interests: she like to hike and travel, and me... Well I'm a redditor stereotype: I like staying at home, watch funny shows and play video games.


So we have NOTHING in common beside being nice I guess? That's how we got to stay together such a long time. It's important to say that I did try to break up at 1 month and after at 1 year on our relationship as I didn't see any real future for us. She convinced me out of it.


The sex was rare (once in a week), but was good. I'm a bit kinky but every now and then she lets me do it as I like and we both really enjoy it, but that's exceptional (about once every two month). So to deal with my (much) higher sex drive I jack off while she sleeps (yeah it's a bit creepy but we live in a 1 room apartment), which is a bit sad I guess?


So I just turned 29, and if I can imagine a future between us, I don't know if it's the one I would like: we have so different tastes we can barely even watch a movie together. And lately she's been stressed out by her sister which is a bit mental (she's getting hospitalized). It affects her mood and her sex drive and I know I should be supportive but it's really hard to make her open up to me and I've had the same scenario countless time in the past I'm just tired of it.


So two days ago I broke up with her. She still lives with me while she look for a new flat, and I can't throw her out: She's still incredibly nice and beautiful and a wonderful girl and I don't know if I'm doing the right thing.

He cooks for me often, he gives me back rubs when I've had a bad day, and he is just generally really good to me. I don't NEED him to  do these nice things, but I've unfortunately gotten used to being treated like this and almost expect it from him now. I feel like he is getting sick of doing this stuff for me now, too. 

There are some aspects of our relationship that are concerning to me. Most of our fighting occurs when I make an impulse decision and don't immediately think of how he would feel about it. I honestly am an impulsive/spontaneous person, and he thinks it is me being inconsiderate whenever I don't immediately invite him to join me. I try to include him in most aspects of my life but I feel that he overreacts to my spontaneity. I have, throughout our relationship, tried to be more considerate of him, but it often feels like I have to make him the center of my life, and I am starting to resent that. 

He is also very negative in general. Little things can put him in a bad mood all day. When I point out to him that he is taking life out on me, he tries to be nice and relax, but I am default more positive and optimistic than him, and it has started to wear me out more frequently than in the beginning. 

I really do love him. He is my best friend, and there are a lot of great things about our relationship. We have the same sense of humor, and he tries to be interested in my interests for the most part. He has picked up a few of my hobbies. I know he tries to make me happy. 

Recently, I have been very overwhelmed with a feeling that he isn't the right person for me. I don't know what to do. I care about his feelings and don't want to hurt him. Another thing that I think about is that we have the same group of friends and we see each other at work all the time (grad school). If we were to break up, it would be really messy.

-I'm in med school, and it's incredibly stressful. Last spring 2013 I had to go see a counselor for 6 months because I was having panic attacks and suicidal thoughts. I don't get panic attacks now but it feels like med school completely takes over my life.  I'm generally pretty miserable in school, struggling to keep up my two exec board positions and make B and C's when I used to be an A student. I do a lot of cry-studying because there's not enough time to do each separately.


-From being depressed last year, I gained a lot of weight. About 27 pounds. I've been steadily chipping away at it, trying to lose weight and then jumping back on the bandwagon when I slip. I'm really trying. I'm now doing T25, running, and eating a low carb diet, and I've lost 5 pounds in a month. I don't feel awesome about how I look (I used to run 15K's and weigh 128 pounds at 5'3, so this weight is completely new/awful for me.) He on the other hand lost a ton of weight, so now we weigh exactly the same but are 7 inches different in height. It's just a daily reminder of how much my body has changed in a year. 


-When we first moved in together two years ago, I decided to start a friendship with an ex with my boyfriend's approval. Obviously, it turned out terribly. Even with being honest/showing every message to my boyfriend, I started developing feelings for my ex. I confessed my feelings to my boyfriend and admitted I'd even thought about leaving him for my ex, but had chosen him over the ex. I expected to be screamed at. Broken up with. Hell, it was what I deserved. My bf didn't get angry or upset. He basically said Thanks for telling me, I'm glad we can be honest with each other. He didn't even really want to talk about it, because we'd already discussed it. He was treating me the same way the very next day and was genuinely and seriously over it.  I know for a fact that he wasn't/isn't cheating too. And this will sound horrible, but in a way I hated how calm he was about it...in his shoes I would have freaked. I should at least have had to work for it and show him how sorry I was, but instead it just felt like...it didn't really matter. It was a non-event. Even so, I unfriended the ex, deleted his number, I can't see any of his stuff online, but I still occasionally think about him. I've cut him out of my life, I've tried thinking about all of his negative traits, I've tried taking an afternoon to just cry and get over it like my therapist had suggested. I have read one redditor saying you should picture your ex taking an awful and disgustingly painful shit which I plan to try (because it's hilarious) but I'd love other suggestions to put the past in the past. 


-My mom has early-onset Alzheimer's. She was diagnosed about two years ago, again, about the same time our sex life started slipping slowly. I dealt with it fine for the first year, until I saw her recently and found out that her ability to speak is fading away fast and her license was taken away. I have nightmares about losing her now around once or twice a week. 


-We moved the wedding from next spring to this coming August (yep, that's right, 3-4 months to plan a wedding) because I LOVE my mom and I wanted her to be there at my wedding and be able to talk and know what was going on. I'm crying as I'm writing this because it's just a daily devastation whenever I think about her. So on top of a dwindling sex life we also have all the stress of planning a very quick wedding. I still think it was the right thing to do because our families are very important to us, but it's just another piece to a very stressful puzzle. 


NOTE: We HAVE discussed our dead bedroom. Multiple times. I've told him we need to bring back the romance, and we both took the 5 languages of love test so we could better show each other how we care. While it helped a little, it didn't help enough. He again just didn't seem worried at all that I was telling him I was having trouble with my desire for sex, but he has put in some effort. Every time I've talked to him about our sex-life problems, I've felt like I could have gotten a similar reaction from discussing how we can lower our apartment's electricity costs.

**tl;dr**: My fiance and I are getting married in a few months, and our sex life/my attraction for him are dwindling. Our bedroom activities started downspiraling two years ago, when a) I had an emotional affair and confessed it to my bf, who was unsettlingly calm/whatever about it, b) my mom was diagnosed with Alzheimer's, c) I was accepted to med school and discovered it was a new hell, and d) he lost 30 pounds and I snatched it up for myself. I REALLY want to make it work and make our long-term relationship feel like more than just a best-friendship.

992,1oe4zg,"This scenario probably echoes a million different questions that a million other people have agonized over, but I need to rehash this for my own sake, nonetheless.

A little over a year ago, I met a woman who's in her mid-twenties (let's call her Amy). We quickly became fast friends due to our shared awkwardness and being in a similar, pressure-laden environment. (We work together, sort of. I'm being purposely vague here, and I apologize for that.) I had a bit of a crush on her at first, but this quickly subsided, since she was in a long-term but long-distance relationship.

Recently, Amy's relationship ended a couple of months ago, and a mutual friend made an offhand remark around that time that made me start thinking about her in a different light. We've spent quite a bit of time together over the course of the last year, and she's one of my favorite people in the entire world. I know she feels similarly about me as well.

Over the last month or so, I have experienced newly romantic feelings toward Amy that have only grown in strength. In fact, I have come to realize that I'm basically in love with her. I don't say this lightly. I know the gravity of those words. In fact, I don't think I've ever truly said this about anyone else. However, something's changed inside of me that makes me confident that this is true in this case.

I know that Amy cares about me a great deal, but I don't know if she feels the way I do. I'm sure many of you are rolling your eyes at this point and thinking *just tell her, dude*. Of course, like most things in life, this feels more complicated than that. Below, I'll go into a bit more detail about why I think that.

I see two probable scenarios unfolding here: one, she also likes me as more than a friend, but we're both too scared to say anything, or two, she simply likes me as a friend and doesn't want things to go further. If I'm being realistic, the latter scenario is most likely.

I might indeed just be direct with her, but I'm honestly petrified of two things. First, I'm scared of ruining what is a great friendship, even if it has become somewhat torturous for me. Second, I'm scared of being the one who cares more in the relationship. I've been the type who gets too emotionally invested in people in the past.

Because I'm fearful of those two things, I have tried to hyperanalyze our relationship over the past year to pick out any signs that Amy regards our relationship as more than friendship. The conclusions I reach are always ambiguous at best. I talked to a mutual friend recently about this. She said that Amy loves me but is afraid she'll hurt me, because of Amy's perception that she is a man eater. The mutual friend said she thought I shouldn't go for it with Amy. However, these feelings aren't going away, so here I am.

There have been a few things in the past that have made me wonder whether she is interested in being more than friends but that are still far from unequivocal. I feel like none of these things individually or in concert really amount to anything. They could be something, but I can't trust myself to interpret anything when it comes to her

* She spends a lot of time around me. If she's in the office, she often comes and sits by me instead of at her desk.
* She initiates a fair amount of physical contact, though none of it is overtly romantic. Examples: hugs, touching my shoulder as she passes by, leaning her head on my shoulder.
* She invites me out a lot. Most of the time, these outings are just the two of us. Sometimes we hang out at my place alone.
* The eye contact. Oh, god, the eye contact. Maybe I'm just interpreting this through my particular lens, but whenever we have a conversation, I feel like the eye contact is super intense.
* Occassionally, she'll make a joking remark about being boyfriend/girlfriend. For example, calling me honey when she sees me, or wondering if person X thought I was her boyfriend.
* She mentioned during a conversation that she thought I was attractive, also mentioning that another coworker thought I was attractive. Following this, she said that I've become so familiar to her that it's hard for her to separate my looks from my personality.

There is also a fair amount of controverting evidence.

* After her breakup, she talked about not wanting to see anyone for a long time.
* She sometimes talks about people she might want to date or people she finds attractive around me.
* There has never been anything overtly romantic between us. Once she crashed at my place, and we both slept in the same bed, but nothing happened. However, this was when she was still in a long-term relationship.

This all seems quite ambiguous to me, and I've certainly not helped make things more clear. I very much dislike the idea of women receiving unwanted romantic attention from male friends, because I feel like this is a reflection of society's tendency to treat women as sexual objects rather than people. So I've been very careful to treat her as a person first. This has meant showing very little physical affection and being very careful not to say anything that could be construed as romantic. Amy mentioned once that she found many of her male friends were mostly interested in getting into her pants, so I have been feeling very guilty about harboring these secretly romantic feelings about her. I feel like I'm betraying our friendship.

I'm very afraid of making things awkward between us. Lately, I've been distancing myself from Amy a bit, because I feel like the more time I spend with her, the more tormented I feel by these feelings toward her. I feel extremely conflicted, mostly because I care for her so much. What should I do?

19,1y66xz,"So a little back story here first. 

There are two friends, lets say their names are A and B who have been friends for a long time, before I knew any of them. I met A in high school in Grade 11 and we became pretty close that year and I developed feelings for her. Nothing really happened though from it.

The next year A went away to university and we fell apart a bit. Then I ended up going to the same school and taking the same program (not because of her). We ended up taking a bunch of classes together and over the next 3 years our friendship grew stronger. We never hung out alone, mostly with our group of friends, but at the bar I would often buy her drinks and we'd dance. Needless to say, my feelings for her came back, but she was usually involved with other guys. 

Over this time B also went to the same university (different program) and we hung out a bunch of times at parties and whatnot.

Anyways, flash forward to the present. Myself and A have hung out a bunch of times since mostly birthdays and stuff like that. One of the significant times though was this past Canada Day. This is apparently where problems begin.

A and B were both there together with a group of friends and I found myself hanging out with them for most of the day. When the tent closed, B was having a bunch of people of to her house for a BBQ and A invited me. I hung out with A a lot. Anyways, on the bus home I texted A and confessed that I had always had feelings for her, but never got a response. The couple times we hung out after, there was no mention of it. 

Anyways, now I'll get to the real problem. A couple weeks ago I met A and B at a bar and B told me that ever since Canada Day she has liked me. Apparently on their cab ride over B asked A if she had feelings for me, A said no, B said Ok, i'm probably going to try and kiss him tonight. Needless to say B and myself did kiss at the bar and then all of a sudden BOOM DRAMA!

I could tell something was wrong with A so I went and talked to her and she confessed that she has feelings for me. I was so blown away by her timing. Why after 6 years, does it take me kissing your friend to finally tell me. Something is just fishy to me. I told her that I have been single for a year and hate it and am looking for a relationship, but she said she couldn't promise me anything. Alright fine. We talked more, and she said that she was ok with me and B.

So the next week we had a mutual friend from university have a party for her birthday. I actually got a ride with A and another friend and everything was fine for most of the night until we began to talk about the week before. I told A that B and I had been talking and were going on a date in a couple of days and she said she was fine with it. I told her I was really thrown back by her timing about telling me how she feels and it wasn't cool. She said sorry and that she doesn't know what's going on with her at the moment and that she has two other guys she hopes to have things work out with (1 of which was at the party) and that i'm #3...WAIT WHAT? EXCUSE ME!!!!


This made me so mad. After talking to a mutual friend, it was clear that A is just playing me.


So B and I went on our date and everything was great. Then this past Saturday B invited me out to the bar, A was also going to be there, but coming with different people. A did tell B that I'm just good for a make out. 


Anyways at the bar B and I hang out all night, it goes awesome and I barely see A. B and I plan on going for sushi on Monday (today) and everything is great, we kiss and say bye.


Then yesterday, when I ask B if everything is ok between her and A she says that she thinks so, but then says she needs time to talk to A about things. I tell her that more than anything, I don't want to ruin any friendships, whether its me and A or A and B. She is appreciative of my understanding, but we cancel our date for today, but now I have no clue where we stand. 


I've talked to A since about everything and told her how I feel about her timing and how she said I'm #3. She is sorry and never meant to hurt me and says she is happy for me and B...except at the moment there is no me and B, because we are both confused about how A really feels. 


I really do like B. She is funny, smart, really attractive and someone I thought to be out of my league. I want to keep seeing her, but I'm worried that somehow A will convince her against it, even though she has told both of us she is fine with it.


I just don't know how to really proceed with this. Should I just wait it out?

118,28088g,"I have been friends with Amy since the beginning of this year (we both just graduated high school). About a month back, I started going out with Mary, one of Amy's best friends. When I told Amy about Mary and I, she confessed that she was starting to become interested in me. The next few times Amy and I hung out, she came on to me, and it ended pretty close to sex before Amy stopped due to guilt.

Amy is clearly very into me, and since the summer started we have gotten really close and I have realized she is the one I want to be with. The only problem is, she's leaving in two months, while Mary and I will be attending the same university. Amy feels bad for ruining what I had with Mary, but honestly my relationship with Mary hadn't been very satisfying for me and she didn't seem interested in anything serious (not that it went on long enough to really judge it).

Since then, I have stopped seeing Mary very much and I see Amy all the time. Whenever I initiate anything sexual, she is super into it at first, then her guilt kicks in and she tells me to stop initiating anything. She is, for some reason, still ok with sleeping together and basically grinding all night. There have been multiple occasions where I probably could have successfully initiated sex, but despite really wanting to, I don't because I know how guilty she will feel afterwards.

Is there a way I can stop making Amy feel so guilty about the situation? I just wish I would have never started anything with Mary so this could work out.

824,3g3n1f,"A short background: The two have been dating for four years. They met in college and are incredibly solid, especially after graduation. I began spending time with them half a year ago. The girl, who I'll call Jamie, has begun to develop a sexual attraction to me. I am very attracted to both of them, and have found myself fantasizing about a threesome with them. While I do not consider myself bisexual, I'm incredibly attracted to the two of them as a couple.  

Today, while chatting, we brought up threesomes. She began saying how she wouldn't know how that sort of thing would work, or if she could ever have one. I told her I was interested in them, but had never been part of one. She began discussing how she could only do such a thing with her fiance, Matt, agreeing to do so as well. 

After a bit of discussion regarding it, she finally came forward and asked me if I'd be interested. She asked if I was attracted to Matt as well as her. I answered the truth, that I am, and that the idea of being part of their intimate relations excites me. 

She said she would talk to Matt about it. I'm nervous because I fear that Matt, who as far as I know is not in any way attracted to me, will feel disgusted by the very notion and not wish to be friends with me any longer. I told her to hold off on talking with him about it, but the truth is we both are very excited by the idea. 

While I know I would never do anything with her alone, as I would never betray Matt like that, I worry that I may be pushing the boundaries of our friendship with talks like this. What should I do? I feel selfish in wanting to pursue the discussion of the threesome, but I feel like the relationship we all share has grown in to the possibility of this being exciting and something we'd all enjoy. 

Please help, I'd love some direction or advice. I don't know how sexually taboo this may or may not be, and it's not really about cheating or anything like that. I'm excited by the idea of being a part of their relationship in that way, but I'm unsure if it's too dangerous a subject to discuss.

A little back story for us: A year or so before we started dating, she was dumped by her boyfriend of 5 years. I'm the first boyfriend she's had since then. We've been dating for 7 months now and things have been great. We've both met each others' families, have said 'I love you' to each other, and we spend all of our time with each other. No real fights or anything. Her friends have also offhandedly told me that she's opened up to me more than she ever did with him. Now on to my issue...

It doesn't really feel like that's true. I never met the ex, but there are small things that have just been chipping at my self-esteem in the relationship. Recently, I noticed that we don't really have any pictures together. We have one where we're making weird faces, but that's it. I asked her if we could get a few together and she said, Maybe if the mood's right and I feel like it. She's told me before that she hates taking pictures, so I chalked it up to just being a part of her character. Then I foolishly looked at her Facebook photos and saw numerous photos with her ex (which she uploaded) and she just looked so damn happy in them. I don't know if she's ever looked like that with me. It just made my heart sink a little bit to think about.

Next, whenever I hang out with her and her friends, they always talk about college stories (when she and the ex dated) and she always sounded like she was partying, going out, or doing something fun. We hardly ever go out and she just doesn't seem interested in that lifestyle anymore. That's reasonable since she's not in college anymore, but it's hard not to take that personally. It makes me feel like she just enjoys doing fun stuff with me less. 

And the final issue-- which is completely petty, but still bothers me-- I think my girlfriend is gorgeous and that I would love to see her in something pretty like a dress or something like that sometime, but she always tells me she dislikes wearing stuff like that and opts for pants and long shirts. That's her personal preference and I respect that, so I don't push the matter. I'm taking her to a really nice formal event for my organization and she wants to wear this jumpsuit thing to it. But in all of the formal pictures with her ex, she's always wearing these sexy, small dresses. Why do I get the jumpsuit?? I know it's stupid, but it just makes me feel like she just doesn't care as much about our relationship. A part of me wonders if she's over her ex. 

Again, I know this is all probably stupid and I'm looking too much into it, but I feel like I'm just getting the reserved version of my girlfriend. Am I justified in feeling this way and if so, how do I bring this up to her? I feel like bringing her ex up will just make undue issues for an overall good relationship.

52,2rh0wy,"Let me begin by letting you all know that this is only my second relationship, and the largest age gap I've ever been with. So part of me isn't sure if a lot of this has to do with age and life experience differences, which is why I'm asking for your help.

My boyfriend Ian and I met around 6 months ago on a dating app, and we spoke for about a month before we actually met in person. I had just come out of my first relationship, and he was rational, level headed, and wise and I really fell for him quickly. In a way, he represented everything that I felt I was lacking in my last relationship. He lives two hours away, so the first time we met he drove all the way to my house just to hang out for a few hours, which I was very flattered by. After that, I started making the two hour trip every weekend, so even though we're long distance, it doesn't really feel like it. (We decided it was better for me to come to him since he lives alone and I still live with my parents, and I like getting away from my family since they can be overwhelming.)

Ian is first generation Vietnamese, and was raised by two VERY traditional parents. They divorced when he was 6, and he went to live with his mother. His mother was very, very, physical when it came to punishments, many times crossing into abuse territory, and was very withdrawn emotionally. He was shuffled around to different family members because of this, and ended up living with an aunt and uncle for a while. Now his father on the other hand, while not physically abusive, falls into the category of the stereotypical Crazy Asian Parent. He has set impossibly high standards for Ian, is constantly belittling him, tells him he's a failure, and micro analyzes every decision he makes. Even though Ian's dad is nice to my face, he has said things about me being a 'whore who wants to get knocked up to ruin your (Ian's) future. It is absolutely ridiculous. I've included this info about his parents to maybe give some insight into Ian's behaviors towards me. So here's the nitty gritty:

Ian is one of the strongest, most driven people I've ever met. Not only does he work full time, but he also teaches yoga and cuts hair on the side. He is a wonderful cook, only shops at whole foods, and works out at least 5 times a week, sometimes more than once a day. He is always pushing himself and holds himself to an impossibly high standard. He serves as an inspiration and motivator to me, and in a way his antics have really rubbed off on me. I have improved my health and fitness ten fold while being with him. On our good days (which is most) we play, laugh, cuddle, and make love, and I feel as though I've never been so crazy about somebody before. He can be truly caring and sweet, and he'll just hold me for hours on end. But then, there are the bad days, or moments I should say. Sometimes he'll have a fight with his dad, or just be in a certain type of mood that causes him to lash out. Or, the ultimate aggravation for him, is me not living up to my 'potential'. Our fights usually never last longer than an hour or so, but please believe me when I say I have NEVER experienced anything like it.

We'll be completely normal, enjoying our time together. But then, I'll say or do something that irritates him and he just completely flips. Some examples:


1.One day I took a while getting ready, and he ended up waiting for about 30 minutes. When we got out to the car, he started to lecture me. He said he couldn't believe how selfish I was to take that long, how did I not see him waiting, I need to be more mindful etc. Just really grinding in how unbelievably oblivious I was to anyone else but myself.

2. When we first started dating and I didn't have a daily routine yet, we would get in long arguments because I wasn't consistently trying to better myself and be a productive person. Didn't do yoga? Didn't meal prep? Didn't clean? God Sara, I can't believe you! You didn't do anything to better yourself today! How am I supposed to care about you if you don't care about you? 

3. We got in an argument about hip hop. Because apparently the rap I like isn't 'real rap', its absolute shit, and it insults him on a personal level because rap was his thing in high school so he knows all about it.

4. We got in a fight because he thought I was wearing too much makeup. He said it made me look like a little girl who was trying too hard and it wasn't how a classy young woman would do it. Jesus Sara, how do you want to be perceived by the world? A teenager experimenting with heavy liner, or a young lady who is naturally beautiful?

As you can see, all of this is completely ridiculous and extremely annoying to deal with. When we first started dating and wasn't used to it, or rather didn't know how to handle it, I would just completely shut down and start crying. I'd get so overwhelmed by him pretty much breaking me down and critiquing everything I was doing with my life that I couldn't speak let alone look at him. This would anger him even more, and in his words I get more mean when you do that because I want you to respond or say anything, how do you think it makes me feel when I'm trying to talk to you about these things that concern me and you make it seem like you don't care or aren't even capable of having a conversation.

We have had a few talks where we've tried to come to an equal ground, and he has realized and admitted that when he gets angry, it's like a switch goes off and he becomes very intense and mean (just like his father), but he insists it's because he really truly cares about my well being and progress and sometimes just doesn't know how to control his emotions. He fully accepts that this is wrong and needs to change, and the outbursts have become less frequent and intense as time has gone on, although sometimes he slips up (which is rare). I have also acknowledged that I need to be a bit stronger and not clam up so hard, because we need to be able to have a conversation if we want to be a successful couple. I have also found that if I call him out and tell him early on in the argument that he's snowballing or being too intense, it does seem to help him calm down and it won't spiral out of control.

So my question for you guys is, what the hell do I do? I really don't want to break up with him because 95% of the time he is WONDERFUL, and it really comes down to him not handling conflict or negative emotion well at all. Do you have any tips that could help him and us better communicate? Or do you think it is a lost cause and I should leave ASAP?

Dated a lot of different kinds of people and am happily in love with a partner of over a year; house deposits aside, he actually feels like *home*. After five months of dating, he told me he loved me and it was reciprocated. A year on, we've faced some challenges, but have helped eachother through them; ie: my stress with work, his need to scale back his drinking. We finish eachothers sentences, love eachothers friends and have a mix of hot, tender sex as well as the kinky, experimental variety.

We are talking about the future, did we (as individuals) want to get married? Have kids? I'm really proud of him recently for returning to college to finish his degree and he has a new job which he is hoping will provide him with some security, but the fact is, he has no savings at all and up until now has lived pay cheque to pay cheque.

I hear that some couples just go with, our money is OUR money, but I have to admit, I'm not totally cool with this. I've worked so hard for my financial stability and I realize that divorce is a business for a reason - because plenty of people thought nothing like that would ever happen to them.

Aside from that, I'm just concerned about other things, like the fact that I can afford to do things when I feel like it, and he can't. We do so much together, that I don't feel like it's an issue now, but I've loved having the money to go overseas when I feel like it, and I don't expect him to be able do to this.

Is it naive to think that the money thing is no big deal, so long as we are compatible in all these other ways?

392,2slq0p,"So we dated for a year. We were very much in love and spent almost all our free time together. We have so much in common and would have a lot of fun together, but we did have a few arguments almost always involved alcohol.
  
On Halloween we went out the bars. Things were going great she told me how much she loved me and all that cute stuff (we were very affectionate, even in public). Well someone brought up an an old ex that I still kept in little contact with mostly through snapchat, she was on my top3, but there was nothing going on at all she even has a boyfriend. Well This lead to a huge argument that broke us up. We were very drunk and she even told me that she was leaving with some of her friends and that we could talk in the morning but I was intoxicated and told her that if she left it was over because I couldn't handle her insecurities (I know I'm a jerk but I was drunk). well she was really mad and embarrassed. she made me eat my words.


After the breakup I was a wreck. She wouldn't talk to me for about a week and also removed me from snapchat. After that we did keep minimum contact and met up twice for the rest of the month but I always ended up bringing up the relationship and it would end awkwardly. we started talking less we saw each other one last time mid Dec for her bday went out for dinner. Things were going great after dinner we grabbed drinks but I started bringing up trying to get back together, she told me that she was still mad and hurt from the breakup, the night just ended awkwardly. After that she told me it was over and that I should move on, I was really torn. I started to be distant and went NC. I heard she was dating so I started doing the same. We did talk on the phone briefly on Xmas and told her things were great( I was still heartbroken but didn't want to show it). Right after that conversation she added me back on snapchat. I saw that she had guys on her top, but hey she is single and my top 3 were girls. 


On New Years I ran into her, she was at the same bar I was with one of her friends. She came up to me gave me a hug and talked briefly. Throughout the night we did talk a little more and even danced a little but her friend kept butting in, even when we danced (her friend was a girl by the way). I left her alone for the rest of the night. I just had fun with friends and danced with other girls. During this time it was clear we were over so I didn't care if she saw me. I just wanted to enjoy the New Years with my friends.


 Two weeks ago she asked me to hangout. She said she missed me. And just like that she started contacting me more, all of a sudden all the guys were off her snapchat. 

Well in the past two weeks we texted and snapchatted through out the days but nothing really indicating that she wants to start a relationship. We hungout two days ago. She drove to my place. I had moved back in to my parents for a few months so she wanted to go in and say hi to my mom and dad, she seemed really happy to see me and my family. We went out for dinner and drinks.It felt like a date. I was finally over the hurt so I was confident like my old self. I was flirty and she responded well to it. We had a lot of physical contact touching arms, rubbing legs that sort of stuff. At the end of the night I was expecting a kiss but I didn't get one, just a ton of hugs but no opening for a kiss, So I knew she didn't want one. She texted me that she got home and that she had a great time. There hasn't been any plans made for a second date. We still text and snapchat.


Although we do texts more its just in spurts through out periods of the day. I guess not getting a kiss sort of made me feel as if she might just want to be friends. I would love to be friends with her but I don't think I can. We have alot of chemistry, none of my other breakups have been this hard. Over the past month I tried to get over her, I dated girls and was doing good but I still love her and know I always will. I want to know if anyone has any advice on how I should handle things. I would love different view on what she maybe trying to do.

I dont really trust anyone in my life 100% and never really have, and it would take 100% for me to open up and potentially cry infront of her.

In the last month i've not had the emotional surplus? so we've been argueing about once every 2 week i think, always ending on good terms because none of us wants to argue. To prevent said arguement i've instead stopped answering her or told her to stop texting this is usually because i start getting annoyed or i was told some new news and start getting sad. we last spoke this thursday where we were having a lot of freking fun me her female friend and me but i got some bad news so I told her that i would write in the morning, she responded with that she would be out with her friend eating and then going to work so she would answer quickly to which i replied Ok. Cool i then wrote the next day and she told me she would write later, she has not written and we normally dont go a day without communicating so i have a feeling i've said something wrong?

I've told her that I have trouble trusting her to which she has gotten really said about, she tells me im important to her, that she holds me dear and she has it best when we keep contact and write. We have been romantic but decided to but a break on it because of personal problems on each side. 

we're not really hanging very often because she is extremely stressed and actually has been diagnosed with it, but she took the time out of her life to talk with me where i sadly pushed her away because i was afraid of her reaction since i was extremely close to a breakdown that day.

Im having trouble putting word on what are annoying me about all of it but i tried, i wrote like 3000 words to her about it all which she read and tried to answer to the best she could, i've never really spoken to people about whats troubling me ever so the support there is coming from her is a bit surreal and tbh i dont think i know how you open up to a person?

My number one interest with her is a romantic relationship so im also afraid me crying infront of her is going to screw that even though she already has told me she would judge me, but again im having trouble trust her ._.

She told me she is worried about me and that she would do whatever is best for me whatever it is, i feel like i should trust her, especially because she isnt a person to randomly trust other people but she trusts me with her problems which means a whole lot to me, so me not trust her 100% hurts us both her the most though.

130,3czs17,"My heart is pounding while writing this. Had to make a throwaway since he knows (and probably follows) my reddit account.

History Lesson: I started a youtube account and made videos catering to a specific community. A guy commented on each of them, expressing how he liked them, then later messaged me asking for my skype info. He didn't know I was a girl at the time. Needless to say we became fast friends and talked pretty much every day. Over time he developed feelings for me and wanted to meet me, but I was uncomfortable with that, and also didn't return said feelings, so I declined. Laced in between the past few years he's shown up randomly, and without warning, to see me, namely the place I work and right outside my classroom after an exam (because he knew what school and what place I worked at and figured out the location) and has grown a lot of resentment toward an ex of mine, who I had repeated cases of conflict with in the past and opened up to him about (this being when I didn't really understand the extent of his feelings. That's on me. I messed up bad.)

The threats/blackmail: Well, basically he's threatened more than once to contact my family members and tell them all the secrets I've told him, about my ex, which would pretty much rip my family apart namely because I'm not a virgin and they are incredibly religious. He's done it in the name of keeping me and my ex away from each other. Explaining that the situation with me and a former love interest is my own business is pointless. It hurt *him* because he was jealous, and so he thinks that he's just as involved as me. When I was having an off-day he accused it of being my ex's fault, to which I said that the ex and I might be getting back together, this guy instructed that I burn a gift he'd given me, as well as sunglasses he left in my car when I drove him back to his own car in my school parking lot, and said, and quote, Don't be surprised if I do something malicious.

Why it bothers me: Besides the obvious reasons, like lack of privacy and making me feel unsafe, I've been wronged by other people in worse ways, and this guy knows that, but his rage is targeted toward my ex specifically because he has a crush on me. When I pointed this out, saying If you found me ugly none of this shit would matter to you he said I was wrong. His plan at some points in time was to sabotage me and then kill himself. He's not well, but he refuses to seek out help, and insists seeing me more often will make all the ill feelings vanish.

My dilemma is that I don't like him. I don't want to be his friend. But I feel like he'll follow through with his threats if I try to get away. He even knows my address, because he checked the database at his last job and I was in their system. (His justification was that he was trying to send me a gift, which never happened as he just cornered me in person and gave it to me then) Even today I made an excuse to not talk to him over skype, saying my headset was broken. He said What about your laptop mic? I said no. To which he said. Bizarre.....okay we'll catch up later. In chat before he's also unleashed some sort of smutty roleplay type of scenario starring me and him, where he basically has sex with me til we both orgasm while I kept repeatedly asking him to stop. He said it was a joke. I don't trust him alone with me at all.

We laugh, etc. and then she asks if I would have a threesome with another guy.. I said HELL no. She asks why, because she would and implies that it's the same thing as having a threesome with another girl.

I told her I don't agree, because if it were with another woman, it would be for BOTH our pleasure since she would be doing things with the woman too whereas sex with another man would be completely for her since I am not open to that kind of thing. (She has fooled around with women in the past, not as far as 'sex' per se, but I know she was open to the idea) She even said before that she didnt see hooking up with a girl the same way as hooking up with a guy so I don't know what's changed. 

We can both be a bit jealous at times, and she knows how strongly against cheating I am. She's always been loyal and devoted so it was a shock to hear that she would entertain the idea of fucking another guy.. and IN MY PRESENCE! I feel like there is a lack of respect there. 

I would've hoped that the thought of something like that would put her off and feel demeaning. So I am disappointed and afraid of being disgusted with her from now on.

I can't fault her for natural human desires or whatever but I also can't help but feel like shit about it. I wish she would feel like I am enough.

Is this a typical female fantasy that most women have and just don't share?

Today she texted me asking if I could come up and talk to her. We go into her room and start cuddling like normal, but then she said she had to tell me something. The jist of it is that a good friend of hers died in a car accident while coming to see her in our town (so she thinks it's her fault), and that she got drunk one night and went to a friend that was friends with both of them and they had sex. This was 6 months ago, and I had never suspected anything, at all, ever. Didn't even know the guy existed, it just happened one night, and it was back to normal.

So she's crying and saying that she hates herself and couldn't deal with the guilt, while I'm just in a state of disbelief. She says she'll always love me, and that I can have all of her. She even asked me to hit her (I didn't do it). I told her that I don't deserve to have someone cheat on me and then lie about it for 6 months. I told her the relationship now feels like a lie, and I feel weak for not dumping her on the spot. I got her to delete my number from her phone (I tried deleting my messages as well, but she snatched the phone back so I guess she can still contact me) and told her that if she wants this to work, I need time to think, and I'll contact her.

And therein lies the problem reddit, I really can't talk to anyone else about this because I don't want to ruin her reputation amongst my friends.

Background:

Me and my girlfriend have been dating for about a year and a half. We had no problems for the first four months which is typical. Then she heard about a hook up I had with some one she knew. This built up inside her until she asked about it. Eventually she demanded that I'd tell her how many hookups I've have had and with whom. After arguing I reluctantly agreed and told her. There were 5 one night stands and I told her I was intimate with my previous girl friend. Let me just add before I met her I've had sex like 10 times total my entire life where as she is far more experienced than I through her old boy friends.

Moving on. After that talk she asked me if she was the only one that matters to me and all that and of course I complied with that. That seemed to be okay for awhile. 

A couple weeks go by and a friend of hers tells her details of the hook ups. I personally don't think that's a good friend at all. We fought and madeup

Fast forward till today:

HER FUCKING FRIENDS KEEP TELLING HER SPECIFIC DETAILS OF MY HOOKUPS. This is driving her insane and some days she doesn't want to look at me. I feel like the biggest ass hole in the world. I do everything I can to make her happy. I tell her how special she is to me every single day and this problem has gotten worse and worse. Today she was texting me like she didn't even know who I was or cared about my existence. It got to the point where I was so over whelmed I got in my car on my break and cried. When she does stuff like this I feel like the bad guy and all I'm doing is hurting her by being with her.

Where I need advice:

I don't want to break up with her. Shes literally perfect for me and we've never had any other issues than this. However we are both on verge of ending this because of stress. We love each other and I know she gets upset because she loves me. I just want to fix this and be happy with her but I think she knows too much. It's gotten to a point where she won't do certain things with me because she is reminded of my hookups by the action. I just want to fix this. Please Reddit. Please help me.

We haven't texted for 6 days! I snapchatted him twice this past week, but I guess they could be seen as general snaps that you send to all your friends, so he didn't feel the need to respond?

He followed me on all my social media accounts, and he's not into social media stuff (way more of his friends follow him and he doesn't follow them back because he barely goes on), so needless to say his interest in me is there.

However, I just don't get why he's not asking me out again. Has he lost interest or does he think I have? I thought our date went really well and we were pretty compatible, I mean he was texting me for quite a bite after our date but I don't want to be the one initiating stuff anymore.

 Our last text convo ended with him saying 'sweet dreams :)' and I felt like I shouldn't text him again (starting a new convo) because he just disregarded my snaps.

However, they got divorced about 10 years ago, because my dad is really bad with money and had to declare bankruptcy etc, so they divorced so that she wouldn't be financially tied to that. They still live together and are still in a relationship. 

So onto the issue: My mom happened to get on our family's pc while my dad had his Facebook logged in, and she saw that he had messages from a woman as well as a few nudes. She of course freaked out and they had a yelling match. My dad says he's never seen these messages, and they were from back in June. He says that a coworker had his phone, and I honestly believe him. 

I know both this coworker and the woman. The coworker got in serious trouble for soliciting a teenager and the woman has also sent me nudes out of nowhere (I work with her and never talked to her in that way). So I'm leaning towards it not being my dad that messaged the woman. 

He showed us some other messages from after the pictures and they were definitely nothing like how he usually messages people. Words he never uses etc. 

Fast forward to the next day and my mom has been crying ever since. She finally tells me it's because he said he'd kill himself if she made him move out. I can attest that really neither of my parents have a life outside of caring for us. I have 4 younger siblings, and I don't know what they'll do when they get older. So I can see why my dad is terrified of not living with us, but suicide is not the answer. 

My dad hasn't told me, any of my siblings about this, so I don't know if I should confront him about it or what? I'm really lost here, and I've never had a friend or family member threaten suicide. Any help is greatly appreciated.

178,2tlkys,"We started dating from when I was 16 and she was 14. She was much more interested in me than I was in her and it's still that way though I still hold strong feelings for her. The other night she asked me to tell her truthfully how I feel about our relationship and I told her I was unhappy and bored with it and she said she felt the same.  
The reason I'm unhappy is because she's constantly depressed and it's hard to hold a conversation with her because she's constantly talking about being sad. I've tried helping countless times but she won't accept my help. She also can be somewhat of a, for lack of better term, bitch. I'll talk to her about music (or something I'm really passionate and interested about, I can go on for hours on these subjects) and she'll occasionally say something along the lines of I hope you know I'm not listening because I don't care. She's gotten better at it and hasn't really done that recently but it still affects me.  
She's sad because of kind of vague reasons, she doesn't like my long rants (possibly mistaken for what I mentioned before) and doesn't like how easily angered I am (small things will set me off but I don't take it out on other people I just explode to myself and will sometimes vent to her).  
After letting our conversation about breaking up set in she realized she felt too strongly for me to let me go and wants to make it work, but I'm turning 18 in three months and leaving high school in five and obviously it will be a long time before she's of age and out of high school too. I want to experience my life and not to really say she's holding me back, but it just won't work with me being 18 and in college dating a junior in high school.  
I have relationship experience but I'm kind of her first real relationship so she's having a much harder time dealing with this. I want to break off from this on good terms but it's difficult for me to even break it off because I know what she's capable of. I'm kind of the only person in her life she really relates to or hangs out with often so I feel far too guilty to just leave her feeling alone. This is eating me alive, I want to get this done and over with but I can't bring myself to do it.

852,2vi9ty,"Me and my girlfriend have been dating a little over 9 months now, in general all good, some fights/arguments here and there but nothing too bad ever. Lately though, and over the past 1-2 months she has slowly lost friends saying how they are all bitches, use her, and so on. While I still want to believe her I more and more think she just has an attitude and becomes very upset easily and then tries to avoid these people more and more. 

She also refuses to try and hang out with these people who she still considers friends, even though some are her fault. For example her friend invited her to her birthday run (drinking) on a Tuesday of our syllabus week when many people were going out. My girlfriend responded saying she didn't want to drink that night, and later was upset when her friend no longer invited her out again (even though my girl friend never tried to hang out with her friend since then). I know that personally if I invite someone and am denied I likely wont ask them again.

Another example would be her friends who she often goes to the gym with left earlier today when she was in class, and then calling them bitches and saying they just use her for her car. Issues such as these have led to her being very stressed all of the time which she often has been taking out on me. For example today walking back from class with her (normally does not happen) I took the stairs as I always do on my route. She then was very upset at me telling me she didn't want to take them and I need to think about her, because she was in rain boots and it hurt her and how I need to think of more often because I didn't ask about which to take. I just kind-of went down them as habit as I normally do, and thought it wasn't a huge issue but apparently it was. This led to other small fights that she then apologized after saying she is just having a tough week/day which now I hear every time after a fight like this.

She also has been very jealous our entire relationship, like being upset with the number of girls I was with before her, my number was 8 and hers 4 which to me is not that different, talking with friends who are girls, but now even more such as being upset my guy friend invited me to a Co-ed softball team, or that when I go out with my friends she tells me that I'm abandoning her because she wants to stay in, that it is not normal to go out both Friday and Saturday, and that she doesn't want me to talk to any girls who might try and flirt with me.

It has been tough lately for me and she is also leaving this weekend (3-day weekend) so she can go home and see her family. I am ok with not having our V-Day on the 14th (save some money), because she feels it will help her relax or calm down, but she is even telling me that I can't go out every night she is gone so she won't have to worry if I am ok, because I might get too drunk (has happened but not as if anything bad has ever happened from it, I just go home and pass out when I do) and I will get hurt or a girl will hit on me.

So that is why I am here reddit. I am unsure what to do because I don't want to say that I think it is her fault she is losing friends, or that I don't want to stay in every night and that I think she needs to stop picking small fights. Does anyone have any advice for me in what to say or what to do?

 In the beginning of our relationship i had suspected Miranda of flirting, which i talked to her about and we both dismissed it as me being paranoid. The guy she was flirting with, who was previously her boyfriend, recently started talking to her again. Well, more like she has started to talk to.

 Anyways, with her I've always had confidence problems, no matter what it was that i accomplished. I felt i always needed to be more for Miranda, to be the best for her. 

About a week ago, i started talking to one of her friends (just a casual talk ) and she starts talking about how they both were going to movies and whatnot on a weekend that Miranda  had told me she was working. After noticing this lie, i notice more and more lies. 

To be honest, i don't feel like i know who she really is. I've connected with her on a very very deep emotional level which scares me for two reasons. 1. She'll know how to hurt me if i break up with her. 2. I'm not sure I'll ever be able to find someone to connect with on that level again.

So, I met this guy online on a non-dating website 6 months ago. We started talking every day, we've video chatted a few times, and we've exchanged literally thousands of messages to each other.

1077,3id9zi,"Back story:

We've known eachother since high school and dated for a few days but she broke up with me to get together with her x(pregnant at the time and wanted to work things out). We ended up meeting again a few years down the line and we got together after my x(lesbian gf and mother of my son) cheated on me and our relationship went sour.

Alishia(wife) and I dated for a short bit, perhaps to short, and got engaged after about a year, another 6 months later we were wed. I thought we were moving to quickly but with Amaya(her daughter who was 3 at the time) looking towards me as a father and our son Elias being born right before the wedding I was confident that I was ready to settle down and make a life with our 3 children.

Our relationship was great, we both worked and we're able to make enough together to rent a home. Things started taking a turn when we started looking for a home to purchase for our own. The first thing that comes to mind is when we had put some of our tax returns asside for the down payment on our home, she had spent all of the 1-2k within 2 months on nonsense like eating out or going to the movies 3+ times per week. She then started missing work regularly to the point of getting fired from a position that she was initially very happy at obtaining. The worst irresponsible thing she ended up doing was taking her car to work instead of mine even though I warned her of the cars tire tread literally peeling off the tire, she had a blowout that day and damaged the cars fender and bumper which I had to replace(again, the first time she rear-ended someone while using her phone).
Her sense of responsibility has continued to diminish and landed us where we are now.

About 2 and a half months ago she landed herself in a behavioral health center for attempted suicide that was due to our relationship troubles, she continuously thought that I didn't love her and no matter what I said she would bounce back to it. One day she was fine, an hour later she would be on the brink of a mental breakdown.

I visited her every day for 2 and a half weeks straight until they released her, the only problem was that she still was very emotional afterwards and wouldn't do anything, she said she had the flu. This however didn't stop her from going to urgent care and filling some old prescriptions which she then used to attempt again(she doesn't recall the week between the time she got out and attempted again at all). This time she ended up staying in a separate facility for 6 weeks, was diagnosed with Bipolar, and treated with lithium. 
I'm now monitoring her medications and only allowing her access to a days worth at a time.

Durring the second attempt I didn't visit her much and I concluded that every time we spoke, her perception of our relationship seemed worse and worse. It all seemed to stem from her lack of confidence and she constantly thought that I was unfaithful and that I had found someone else. 

She became increasingly irrational and at this point I decided that it would be best for her to move out of the home and learn how to be responsible again. The terms were for her to come home, find a job and move out on her own for a while. She didn't like this at all and retaliated by threatening a divorce. When I didn't respond by changing my mind she continued to pressure the divorce idea and stated that she refused to move without one. I tried to reason with her about my intentions but its been like talking to a brick wall.

Right now I sit here typing this while she now wants a divorce and states that she no longer wishes to be with me, she's been saying hurtful things and I have had enough. I have told her to seek marriage counseling if she wishes to work things out because every time we talk, our relationship seems to get worse and worse.

She goes out once a month and I usually don't mind. Last year (I know its been a while), there was this bikini event at the club she goes to. I didn't like it but I didn't say anything and let her go. I then get a call from her at around 3 am asking to be picked up from a community that's litteraly 15 minutes away from the club. AGAIN, she's only in a 2 piece, she tells me that she was at person's house that usually shops at the girl clothing store she works for. She said she doesn't remember her name. When I ask for the address she tells me she left the place and walked down to the closest gas station. IN HER 2 PIECE. ITS COLD CMON WTF. I finally forgot about it until one night she left her phone in our living room and went to sleep.

I tried really hard not to look at it. Thoughts kept coming into my mind because she was on it all the time on facebook. She's pretty attractive so of course i'm thinking hard at looking at it. The more I think about it, the more I get this sick feeling in my stomach. I didn't know if it was guilt, or a much darker, depressing feeling of catching her in the crime... I did it... I looked...

Some guy was constantly messaging her... sexually harassing her with I want you so bad. It looked like she was mostly trying avoid the subject but I kept scrolling up... I seen this reply No i don't want you to stop, you turn me on so much. The anger... I couldn't sleep. She was in our bedroom sleeping. I sat on my couch with this horrible feeling in my gut for hours until both the baby and her woke up... I don't want to get into details about our conversation but she cried and said she loved me... I looked at the baby i pretty much adopted... I loved that kid. Every time she smiled, I couldn't help smiling. She was niave of what was going on and was playing around with her toys. It hurt so much watching the kid. I didn't want to walk out of her life.

I agreed to stay. She promised me she would never do it again. 2 weeks later I couldn't help but look at her phone to see the same guy now TEXTING HER. We worked it out but these scenarios still haunt me to this day.
My question to this day though is what the hell happened that night when I had to pick her up at that gas station.

My girlfriend (20) and I (19) have only really been involved with eachother for 3 months and we have only been officially BF/ GF for 2 weeks, but we have been spending almost everyday together, been having a sexual relationship, genuinely love eachother (she said it first to me, but I definitely feel the same way) for the past 3 months before we started calling eachother BF/ GF. Our relationship has accelerated at a phenomenal rate due to the fact that she was having a gap year in my country, so we always knew she would be leaving (she left yesterday and had been here for 9 months), that is also the reason why we weren't calling eachother BF/ GF as we knew it would be ending soon. Yesterday I brought her to the airport, really really tough to say goodbye like that. We have talked and planned to fly to eachother's countries to visit over summer (I've already been over to her home country with her for a weekend). She also may be going to college here next year.


I met her through a group of acquaintances (my bestfriend is going out with one of the girls in this group) who she is no longer friends with, I found out the reason why last night at a party. Apparently the other girls who were friends with her stopped being friends with her because they felt that she was using me and keeping me as a second option if she couldn't hook up with other guys on a night out (by 'hook up' I mean kissing. She is very reserved in terms of sex, I was her second sexual partner, her first being with a boyfriend she was with for 2 years ). We never really talked about exclusivity because we weren't exactly going out, we talked about it once or twice and I said she was free to do what she wanted because I know she didn't want a relationship to start off with, I didn't actually feel this way and in retrospect I should've said otherwise (due to the gap year ending again).


Last night I also heard that 3 weeks ago she asked a friend of my best friend of mine (this best friend being the BF of the main girl who is no longer friends with my GF) if he would come back to hers and cuddle but not have sex. I was out that night but I was late to the club and she ended up coming back to mine.


Last night felt like a sort of intervention, there were 3 people telling me all this shit about her, it came across as bitching and not that they cared for me and my situation (they could be jealous, as my GF is very attractive and has achieved A LOT for a 20 year old?). It was very hard to take in as the girl I'd gotten to love so much over the last 3 months was a completely different person to what they were describing. 


My GF and this group have not been friends for about 2 months and in those 2 months my GF has repeatedly told me that the group are out to get her and make her life miserable and enjoy taking things away from her, and that they would try to take me away from her. So I'm left in a shit position. On one hand I have this girlfriend who 24 hours ago I adored...she seemed so perfect and I couldn't get enough of her and I genuinely felt that she felt the same way about me. On the other hand I have a group of acquaintances telling me that I've fallen for a completely different girl.


I talked to her this morning on Facebook chat for a bit telling her exactly what was said the previous night. She said that yes she did ask this guy to come back to hers but she mentioned that we weren't actually going out by that time and it was only because she doesn't like being alone. With the other stuff about me being a backup and all the other shit, she brought up that the girls were out to get her and wanted to ruin everything she has. She was very upset on chat and really angry that I was even considering believing what they had told me, because we had always talked about how crazy the group of girls were.


I have no idea what to do from here. Any advice? Cheers.

After this M started inviting me to lunch again.  I was busy and don't enjoy hanging out much so I always declined.  Finally he asked if I wanted to hang out at an event yet again, and I accepted out of guilt (saying no too many times).  Again, the conversation was smooth, and I enjoyed the time so I thought I wouldn't mind hanging out again some time in the future.  This is where the problem seemed to start - I'm a home body, VERY introverted, enjoy being alone and feel smothered easily - I'm satisfied seeing someone once every few months, but after this hang out M was messaging me every day with hang out suggestions.  Meeting for lunch, going to some event, etc. etc..  It started to get really annoying to me and I kept making it clear I was busy or just ignoring the requests, but saying no to every suggestion made me feel guilty (you can see a trend her... I've dug my own hole with this spineless personality trait) so finally suggested a hang out with M and a friend of mine [24 f].  Call her H.  

The night BEFORE the event, M messages me and H and suggests a movie.  I said I was busy but H went ahead and went for the movie.  The next night the three of us went to our event.  THIS IS WHERE THINGS WENT BAD.  In talking, M began mentioning his views on things like life, religion, politics, etc., and I realized M and I have incredibly conflicting core values.   In fact, I was really turned off by most his views.  I dropped off H that night and when I went to drop off M he was acting  very nervous and awkward around me which made me feel he was in to me.  I got uncomfortable and went home.  He messaged me right away once he noticed I was online when I got home.

The next morning the messages started non stop.  I am not a big facebook person so this was tiring.  Finally I talked to H, and told her I was uncomfortable by M's messages and views and she mentioned that when she was relieved to hear this as when she went with M to the movie that night, he'd made her uncomfortable as well, and he also was messaging her constantly since then, 5 - 10 times a day, any time he sees her online.  NOTE: they had never spoken to or seen each other before that movie.  her and I were unsure how to handle this and despite ignoring his messages the past week, still he continued to send message after message after message, offers to hang out, etc.  I always keep my status offline but if ANYTHING comes across like I made a post on a friends wall, I am immediately getting a message from M.


I have never been in this position.  There's nothing wrong with M as a person he's just not someone I have much in common with and his views offend me.  I'm someone who keeps very few close friends and don't like a crowd and I don't want to continue hanging out with him.  M deserves honesty which I want to give him but he comes across as very immature and I don't know what to say or how to say it in a way that spares his feelings.

I'm scared he might like the attention and novelty and stuff he gets from her. It makes me really worried... I'm worried that if she tried initiating things, he would go along with it? We've had such a good relationship but my recent trust problem might be getting out of hand.

212,1q1f6a,"So my SO approached me a few weeks ago with the idea that she wants to possibly get a nose job. Now, normally, I'd like to think that I would support her in her decision if it makes her happier, but this doesn't feel right.

Since we've been together (2 years), she has hinted at things that show she puts a lot of emphasis and attention to physical looks. Even when it doesn't apply to her, and she comes off as shallow. I know who she really is and I don't hold it against her, but it still manages to disturb me.

Here are a few examples:

1. Once while we were drinking at a bar, we befriended some really nice couples who lived in the area. They were really friendly to us and we had a great time. Afterwards, my SO said I didn't think average looking people can lead such happy lives. I was dumbfounded. She was joking of course, but still.

2. At the age of 18, she pushed to get breast implants. Til this day, she says she doesn't regret it. And I believe her, and I'm totally fine with her decision (although I think it may have been a bit too young). But in context I think it applies to my concerns mentioned here.

3. She mentioned getting some kind of surgery to correct her ears. She thinks they're not symmetrical and it bothers her. However, no one else even notices these things. But she says she sees it in photographs.

I should mention that she recently admitted to being unhappy with herself and has started taking steps to improve her self-image. She has started talking to a therapist, and she is trying to get better.
Also, the surgery itself is minor. It's just altering the width. She doesn't like how her nose looks when she smiles, so she doesn't like to smile in pictures at all. Any picture of her is her attempting a sexy pose, but never smiling. But I don't feel it justifies spending THOUSANDS of dollars to fix something so frustratingly minor.

I should note that she is extremely attractive. I mean, she's gorgeous. She turns heads and is absolutely stunning to the point that people are constantly telling her this. But again, she feels these minor insecurities strongly enough to justify these minor cosmetic alterations.

I do believe these tendencies stem from her beauty-obsessed mother who hassled her about looking beautiful while she was growing up, but it's starting to worry me a little.

Am I wrong for having these hesitations? Or should I just shut-up and learn to support her in her decisions?

847,2jjpgt,"Background: We met in a prestigious and highly competitive graduate program. My husband has always been a pretty relaxed and some might say unmotivated individual. It isn't that he is lacking motivation per se, but once he decides he doesn't like something, is bored, or doesn't want to do something he becomes lackadaisical and certainly is not giving 100%. He also is less ambitious than many people in our field(s) and has often said he will be fine with really any decent paying job in his field. I on the other hand, am one of those raving mad foaming at the mouth crazy dedicated types who often spends even my off hours working. We are in similar graduate programs and I have been doing really well for myself while his experience has been almost the opposite; many false starts, many unavoidable misshaps, poor communication with advisors, and a somewhat less than stellar work ethic has led to him being unceremoniously discharged from his position. He has the option of either quitting completely and getting a random job, or trying to find a new advisor to finish his degree. He has been trying desperately to find a new place, and had an option fall through after everything seemed perfect and wonderful and almost set in stone. I see him getting more despondent, both of us are pretty freaked out in terms of the financial implications and I don't know what to do.

The problem: I know this is probably the time for me to be as supportive as possible. The trouble is I am a fixer. I am extremely bad at comforting people, and never know when it is time to just say 'im so sorry it will be ok' versus when to be like 'alright well, let's come up with a battle plan now and a back up plan as well'. I am on the spectrum but have gotten much better about understanding emotions and identifying them as I have gotten older. Dealing with them is still something I am learning.

I know it is probably not the time to push him to cover all his bases, to let his parents know in case we need financial help, to consider other career options, but I am admittedly freaked out by all this (I have savings but he doesn't really, and we have wedding money but I am REALLY hoping it doesn't come to using that nest egg for basic survival costs). I also know that even though I'm pretty pissed that I have been telling him for 2 years he needed to do things differently and work harder and communicate with his boss more and he never listened but now here we are, I can't actually say that because it's ultimately not helpful.

I see him spiraling into a dark place but I am at a loss for what to say or do. I need to stop myself from giving overbearing advice and trying to 'FIX ALL THE THINGS' and instead know how to be supportive and not come across as judgemental. Awkward pats on the back, or shoulder rubs is sort of my go to but I need more to work with here.

874,2o880l,"So my girlfriend and I are getting done with school for the semester and both work multiple jobs. We both knew with the semester coming to an end and the retail holiday season we wouldn't be able to see each other as much as we did normally (ironic with the holidays yes?) which was morealess 6 days a week. We've kept in contact through calls and text as best we can the past few weeks. 

Last night we were talking and she tells me that she really wants to start going to church again. She went often as a little girl to a very conservative Baptist Church(no showing shoulders or bare legs type thing). I replied that it was fine with me if it was what she thought would help her out. 
We normally didn't see each other Sunday mornings so it's not too big of a change for me, I thought. If it makes her happy I am happy, but don't care to go. She now wants me to move my schedule around and go to church with her to try it out, which I am also open to. 
Yet, if I don't feel the power of the holy spirit and want to go not just for her, then she wants to consider breaking up. 
Religion is a non factor to me and if someone needs to it sleep at night or feel safe i'm all for it. She didn't have the best parental support growing up, so I understand her point of view, but it's not mine. In the past, going to church just doesn't do anything for me. I have no problems going to see and support her, but I told her to not get hopes up that I would fall in love with the idea for me personally.
She said she would have to think hard to consider staying around even if I didn't go to church. She said she would most likely leave if I didn't become a regular religious buff like her.

Her reasoning is that when she has kids, she wants to raise them in a church household and doesn't want conflicting parents confusing children.   I feel i'm one of the more quiet people when it comes to what you want to do, as my my mom's family is extremely catholic, dads side is Lutheran, best friend is morman, another is jewish, many agnostics and atheists and we all get along just fine.  

Am I wrong for believing she is thinking way too far ahead?
There are many other relationship bridges to cross before that, and at 20 I am not even thinking of any of that soon. 

She also hinted at the fact if she got really into the religion she would stop drinking and stop having sex to until marriage. Prior, we would drink together often and our libidos have had us going 2x a day. She said that at one point if she felt strong enough about her religion we she would cut off sex until we got married and could do it out of the blue (I think this is ridiculous).

So she wants to take a break because of that and she has depression so obviously I wasn't helping with that. Also her parents dont feel like she can handle her job and our relationship simultaneously because we've been so on and off in the past 3 years (she's dumped me 3 times before, but we always end up together again somehow). So there are a lot of factors apparently and she says she just needs some time, like 2 or 3 weeks, to sort things out with her parents and work and also evaluate how much I really mean to her.

But do couples come out of a break better than before? Should I be worried? Is it better to cut off all communication or is keeping communication important?

340,1in473,"Alright this will be a little hard to explain but I'll try:
This contains 5 people: 
me (21m)  
my girlfriend (18f)
my best friend (20m)
my best friends' ex girlfriend (18f)
A douchebag (let's call him douchebag (19m)

A while ago my best friend broke up with his ex girlfriend. It really sucked for everyone around them as well because they were part of a friend group I'm in as well. Even though he's my best friend I still am friends with the ex, she's always been nice to me and vice verca.

The night they broke up, Douchebag showed up. Douchebag is a guy that is close friends with anyone involved in this story; except for me. I have always hated his fake overly friendly /tryhard to be funny guts. However, my friends and girlfriend were his friends so I accepted it. big deal, right? Well.. yes. The night my best friend broke up with his ex, the douchebag her all night trying to make out with her, flirting with her and trying to 'calm her down' since the break up. The ex was very drunk, nothing like I had ever seen. I think this is important to mention.

Obviously, this pissed me and my best friend off alot, I told him to back off because douchebag and my best friend (were) pretty good friends before. He didn't listen and in the end he ended up taking advantage of my friends drunk ex, and made out with her. The first time she backed away and told him she didn't want it, the second time she complied.
I was furious when I had heard this, because I had told him to back off. 
Whenever I try to talk about it to my girlfriend she starts defending him and says: But he's so nice, he would never do that bla bla bla. 

This leaves: 1. Me in a shitty position, 2. my best friend heartbroken, 3. his ex doesn't give a crap about anything and obviously denied it, only told my girlfriend.
 I made a promise with my girlfriend we don't discuss those things together because nothing positive can come from it.

So, that's the situation. Now, next time I see him; I obviously want to punch him in the throat. I don't think I'm gonna do it but I would like to very much. I see him about every weekend and I have no idea how to interact or even be in the same room with him. I don't want my girlfriend to be mad at me for being a dick to him....

Basically my boyfriend's dad is an alcoholic and is going to lose his license which means my boyfriend has to take his dad's car into his name. This is very stressful to him, understandably. (Note: He does not have a lot of money, nor a job and doesn't actively search for one. He just uses the returns he gets from his grants for school.)

Well, every time it gets brought up, he doesn't want to talk about it and actively changes the subject. 

Just a few minutes ago, it got brought up in conversation. I very calmly explained that instead of stressing, perhaps he should talk to someone at the DMV/ insurance companies to see how much it will cost to transfer everything and make a plan from there. I suggested that he give his current car to his little sister and have his mom pay the insurance and then drive his dad's car. 

I explained that this was all simply a suggestion based on the information he had given me and I was in no way insinuating that he had to do it or that was the exact right option. I said that I wanted him to be happier and not stress as much and I thought this might help because I know it helps me to have all the facts when I'm stressed out. 

He told me that he was now incredibly pissed off even thinking about it, told me he'd thought about all those options before and that he couldn't just dump that burden on his mom and that he wasn't stupid and he knew all this and then hung up on me. 

So, I set my phone to send his calls straight to voicemail and not notify me when I had a message from him. I'm hurt and sad and upset. All I was trying to do was help. 

He complains about stuff a lot and then doesn't do anything to change it and then wonders why things go wrong. I don't know what the next move is. This behavior is severely affecting how I feel about him, but there are a lot of god qualities he has that make me not want to break up with him. I'm so confused. Please help.

191,32sqiz,"Hi everybody, I recently moved into my girlfriend's place a few months ago and am adjusting to living with a SO for the first time.
In many respects it's going very well, and I know that's it never a straightforward process. 


We both suffer from anxiety/depression, and I was diagnosed with Harm-OCD a few months before we moved in together, which makes for an interesting mix to say the least. 


This anxiety has spilled over into the sexual side of our relationship, but I'm happy to say this is something we are dealing with right now 
with some success after several false starts and near-breakups.  I've been prescribed antidepressant medication and have been attending CBT sessions monthly, which have identified, among other things, behaviour consistent with subjugation and dependence schemas, low self-esteem, fear of confrontation, feelings of defectiveness or alienation, which may have influence over what I've written below.


My GF is a self-confessed bossy personality at times, and this has proved useful, indeed necessary in her job. 
She is an extremely kind and empathetic person in lots of little ways, especially when someone is struggling or needs help, 
and is the ideal person to have around in a crisis situation, as she is able to take control and make it better. She does lots of nice little things for me around the apartment and 
I know she genuinely cares for me and loves me.


One area that I'm not satisfied with however, is the way she speaks to me sometimes. 
She can be impatient, critical or dismissive at times, and sometimes respond to the most innocuous questions in an angry or snappy tone, 
almost as if the question was an accusation! I know this happens occasionally in every relationship, but the frequency with which it's happening is really
angering me. Over the past few months, this resentment has been building and intensifying, and seemed to really go up a notch a few weeks after
I started CBT and antidepressants, so I'm not sure if they're all connected.


My reaction to her behaviour up until recently was to withdraw and sulk, rather than confronting it. 
This I know now is not a healthy reaction, and fights/arguments in relationships, when appropriate, can actually be another form of sharing and intimacy.
However, these days I'm calling her out on it more, but her reaction is often at first to say what, are you angry with me now?! as if I'VE done something wrong, and then a few minutes 
later she will apologise properly. I try to put myself in her position and empathise with her or justify her behaviour, and think about how whatever I did or said could have irritated her,
but more and more I'm finding that justification too hard, and the apologies ring ever more hollow with each instance of her irritability, snappiness, or moods.
I wish, instead of apologising, she'd just do it less.

She'll also try and justify her behaviour some times by glumly saying I'm a bitch or You need to be more assertive, neither of which are helpful as both statements absolve her
of any responsibility for her behaviour, instead blaming it on ME(!) or external circumstances that are rigid and unchangeable, neither of which are true.


I don't believe there is any malice intended in her behaviour, as she doesn't only act this way with me, but with her siblings too, and I think this behaviour is rooted in her anxiety and insecurity, but nonetheless over time it's created an increasingly toxic resentment in me, and I'm spending more and more time stewing over things she's said to me, to the point I'm sitting in work or in my car, working myself up into a frenzy, cataloguing the ways in which I've felt mistreated due to something she has said, even though she may not have said anything upsetting to me that day. When I come home to her on those bad days, I'm often in a defensive, hyper-vigilant state, and am somewhat  on edge, walking on eggshells to some degree when around her. 


It's also affecting my perception of her, as I've moved from almost idolising her, to sometimes just thinking outright that she's a bitch, or mean, and my perception of the relationship in my head has been tainted, my worry now being that that such a prolonged period of resentment and negative emotion on my part has permanently, irretrievably damaged the relationship's prospects. 


The prospect of breaking up with her is on my mind a lot nowadays as well, as I sometimes feel emotionally drained/numb and want to just escape, but then that is immediately followed by the prospect of losing her, and her good qualities, as well as the shared future I imagined us having together. I also am trying to keep in my mind that maybe a lot of relationships are like this, with the recent upheavals in my life leaving me vulnerable to depression, negative thinking, cognitive biases, hypersensitivity and so on. In short, I'm just really confused and emotionally exhausted, and don't know what to do next. Any constructive, substantiated advice would be appreciated.

I told her that I was going to look for some advice, although I didn't mention it would be from Reddit, but what the two of us need is advice from someone with more experience than we have. We want to know first of all how important is it to have lots of things in common in a relationship, have some people made it work regardless and how they made it work. Also tips for finding things in common we may have never known about would be very appreciated. Even though both of us want to stay together the idea of us not being able to work out in the long run is scary, especially when we barely get to see each other right now.

186,1v087f,"I have been together with my girlfriend for almost two years now.  We were high school sweethearts. From the first time we hung out, we automatically clicked and fell in love. She is my best friend and I love her with all my heart. I cannot imagine my life without her. 

We are both very focused on our academics. She was the salutatorian of our private Catholic High School, I was a couple of spots behind her. When it came time to choose what college to go to, we both had differing opinions. We both knew that we were going to go further in school than just an undergraduate degree. We are planing on applying to medical school in three years. Not actually attending medical school until our fifth year after high school. We both live in New York, and planned to go to college in the northeast. 

I knew that college is going to be expensive no matter where I go. So I concluded that I should go to a school that is both known for academics, yet is reasonably affordable as well. The school I ended up choosing was a state school in New York called Stony Brook University(SBU). Because I was a resident of New York, my tuition was very very reasonable. The education I am receiving/ will receive is extremely worth the money. The science program at SBU is one of the best in the northeast, and is by far the cheapest.  It costs only about ***$18,000*** a year.

My girlfriend however took a completely different path.  She likes the best of the best. Some of the schools she applied to included Columbia in New York City, Cambridge, Boston College, and SBU. However, out of that list of very prestigious schools, she only got into two, Boston College(BC) and SBU. You might not be aware, but the tuition at BC is about ***$62,000*** a year. So in four years... thats ***$248,000*** in total. 

The diploma from either of our schools basically holds the same weight, yet the school my girlfriend choose was BC. I will admit, the school is very beautiful and very private compared to the large public state school setting at SBU.  But with BC comes debt.  Her parents are not able to afford to pay for her education so she is taking out college loans herself. She is going to be in debt for the rest of her life, and the way our relationship is going, so am I... This is before taking into account the cost of medical school, which could amount to almost double the debt she attained from BC. 

And so now here we are today, done with our first semester at college. She did well, I did just as well, but the money we spent to take basically the same classes greatly differs.  I know for a fact the classes I took at SBU were much more in depth and were much more valuable then the classes at BC. Every time she had trouble with work, I helped her over video chat. I experienced her work load first hand.  

We looked into how much it would take to pay off the college loans for BC and it would be about ***$1,500 a month for about 50 years***. That is compared to my loan which I will pay off in only 10 years. 

Now she is considering transferring, and it is a very tender subject. How should I go about discussing this with her? She loves the school she is at, she really does. But the debt hanging over her head is literally killing her and has a very negative effect on me as well. 

She is the most faithful girl I know; cheating or being unfaithful isn't even a worry for us. I go visit her as much as I can when she's there.

So now what do I do? I love her with all my heart and I know that she is going to regret her decision in the future staying at BC. I don't know how we could ever get a real life started if were always living paycheck to paycheck paying off a college loan. Do I convince her to leave BC and go to SBU and get the same education for less money? Or do I support her and let her stay at BC and worry about the money when the bill comes in the mail? Help please.

449,25ghvy,"Hi. First time in this subreddit so not sure if this is the right place but..... I've been dating my gf for a year now and still have a lingering feeling that something is going on when I'm not around. 

Because of my job I'm (30m) not home very often at all (like 4 months a year) but when I am home she (28f) is always very accommodating to me and seems to treat me like a king. Because I've been cheated on before I have a hard time with being away so long and knowing that she is home without anyone to be with her. I'm basically the easiest person in the world to cheat on and it makes me nervous. 

She claims that all my thoughts are unfounded and that she has never given me a reason to believe she's cheating. The real problem is that she cheated on her ex long before we ever met and told me that she never confessed because he should've known what was going on. This absolutely terrifies me and I can't stop thinking if I'm just supposed to know what's going on or if it's all in my head. 

Some things she does are leaving her phone on silent at all times as far as I can tell, always erasing her old texts except for a few regulars like me and family, I'm usually getting up while she's goin to bed so we have a little time to talk at night and then we talk more when she wakes up but latley she has gotten a new job which has her schedule a little crazy and has been missing some time at night which is 10pm her time and not talking to me until 7am her time which is a lot of sleep to me, just las night she disappeared for 20 minutes in he middle of our convo and when she came back she told me she needed to get a glass of water. For 20 minutes. 

I know I'm thinking about this stuff a bit much because of my situation but am I completely crazy or should I be really worried? Any advice is appreciated.

277,3hhtlw,"Hello guys. I've posted here before about a girl that I caught feelings for hard. I really liked her and i thought she liked me. We hung out all the time, talked until the wee hours of the morning, and had a lot in common. We never had sex, but there were some intense Netflix and chill sessions. With one week left of work for both of us, I noticed she acted different around me and texting her wasn't the same. I just figured she was on her period or something and continued conversation as normal. 

Fast-forward to the very last night working together. Everything was going normal until the end of the shift came and we said our goodbyes to our co-workers. As I was talking to one of our fellow servers, I hear someone shout Bye (Girl), have a safe trip home! I quickly end my conversation and rush to catch up to her. I ask her why she is acting so different and if she would like to talk or not. She said she didn't want to talk and quickly left. Confused as all hell, I text her to try to find out why she is acting so strange. Long story short, she told me she has no feelings for me what so ever and tried to deny that she ever liked me at all. She told me every minute we spent together meant nothing to her and stuff like that. As I was trying to figure out the motive behind all of this, she was barraging me with slander, trying to degrade through the whole ordeal. What do I do and where do I go from here?

I have never had one night stands or similars because i'm not confident with myself. The case is that someday i meet a nice girl; she was energetic, happy, daring,.. a girl who loved baking cakes, take pictures with friends.. she was for me the best.



The thing i most desired in this world was to have a gf and finally i get it. Over the years I have been careful, I've made ​​her laugh, I had her all possible details, I have always been with her without ever asking anything in return just a little love and affection... and until the first year it was so. After the year, she stopped to have details that previosly had with me (silly details but we know that silly details made your day). Instead of talking at her and asking for more details, i decided to stop having details with her just so see her reaction, and the reaction was I'm sad because you don't have details with me but i can't say anything to you because i don't do it too. In that moment i guess that she should have change her way to do things but no..



Nowadays, she is living in a foreing country since september because she is doing a master degree and i'm going to visit her every month since then because i have found a job near my town (she onlye travelled home once since then). We were missing each other and i said to her that i'll move to her new country after a few months, when i have money and i have improved my english.



She does not believe any of my words, does not mind all the things i've done for her and the relation (flights, surprises, a giant teddy bear dog,...), she is tired of waiting.



Since this argument, middle march, in which she said that i have to choose, move to their house or splitting the relation, i feel betrayed, deceived and disappointed because she said she can't stay with this situation anymore and she does not know what she feels, if she is in love with me or not. In relation to me, instead of throwing the towel i said to her that everything is going to improve and both of us will save the relation.



After 2 months, she only says that she loves me when i first say to her that i love her. I'm tired of this situation and i think that i don't deserve this after all the things i've done.

I'm from a small town where everybody knows everybody. My senior year level consists of roughly 80 students and as most people would know, in high school friendship groups are established and tend to stay the same throughout, making it hard to find new friends. My friends and I have usually gotten on well after being friends for about 6 years. We used to have sleepovers, go camping, have movie nights etc, but the past year and a half or so, either I changed or they did, and they no longer make for nice friends. 

To give you a quick summary of me; i'm very introverted and enjoy sitting at home with my dog on a Saturday night watching a movie. If I do go out, it's to the local pub to play pool with my boyfriend and his mates until about 11pm. I'm from a family who finds it hard to put food on the table every week and I work 3-4 nights a week myself to pay for a car that is just as old as me. I enjoy school and my aim is to get into a politics or law related course next year at university. These girls however, are the opposite. They come from upper-class families, spend their weekly allowance on clothes, get crazy drunk every weekend, and gossip all through class. And to get you lot enraged, they remind me that *'reddit is a site for nerds'*, great 'friends'. 

I'm being made to feel annoying and purposely left out because I can't afford to do things they'd like to do, or they pick activities which I would never want to do, e.g. spending a weekend in the city to go out clubbing, which is un-affordable and does not sound like much fun at all. They belittle everything I do and make fun of a lot of the things I do. They make disrespectful comments when they're in my car, telling me my car is a piece of a shit and I should just buy a new one. Oh lord if it were only that easy. 

Obviously these are people I don't want to be around, but I'm finding it hard to disassociate with them. They created a facebook group that is just our circle of friends and we are in all of eachothers classes. Physically and through the internet they've made it hard for me to avoid them. 

Although these people don't make for an inviting school week, I feel I should mention my boyfriend and my out of school life makes up for it. I have another circle of friends out of school who are a bunch of interesting, intelligent people, all with very different personalities. Every now and then we'll meet at the pub at watch the footy with the rest of the community and it's really enjoyable. The problem here is, they are mostly my boyfriend's friends who I've befriended through him which leaves me friendless if things go sour with him (fingers crosses they don't!) Oh and they live over 55km away...bye bye petrol money!

I honestly just feel really stuck and I'm horrible in confronting social situations and would love some advice. My only plan is to wait it out another 6 months and by then school will be over and I'll hopefully living in the city. But i fear that my grades will be affected in the meantime due to all the distraction and frustration. Am I being overly dramatic? Are most people like this and is this teenage drama just something I need to learn how to deal with? Or if not, how do I change my situation? Any advice is appreciated.

427,2z0rql,"Hello Reddit! New user here so I apologize in advance if I screw something up.


A little about myself, almost a year ago now me and my gf of 2 years broke up. We were going in two different directions in life and at the end I realized she was just using me for a relationship and someone to call her boyfriend. I know now that she just wanted someone and she just happened to find me. I really loved her and she was my first and only real serious relationship ( I lost my virginity to her even). After we broke up I was pretty fucked up, and not to get myself a pity party or anything, but within about 6 months she was already engaged to another guy, and is now married and pregnant. I realize we weren't meant to be, and have moved past having feelings for her. But I tell you this to grant some context as to the kind of fucked up place I've been in over the past year.


I naturally have trust issues due to several messed up relationships and friendships that I've had over the past few years. I have an incredibly hard time opening up to people, getting close and letting myself trust others. Its not an inherently bad thing, I've had to do several friend purges over the last couple years distancing myself from people in my life that just detract from my happiness and well being. Or more often than not just used me for the relationship or friendship but refused to reciprocate anything when I needed them i.e ( whenever they wanted to hang out but I couldn't I was the bad guy but when I wanted to hang out and they couldn't I was being unreasonable. or just used me for favors or companionship but could never return the favor). But none the less, its left me with a very small, select group of close friends and family that I love to death. Which is why whenever I meet someone who I think I can trust and let myself get close to I'm naturally apprehensive about it. But like I said, I say all this to shed some light into the type of place I was at about 6 months ago when I met Jenny (fake name don't worry).


After my breakup I was messed up emotionally due to the fact that I believed my ex had been cheating on me the whole time we were dating considering she apparently already had another guy lined up to take my place. This however didn't deter me from dating around a lot! But despite dating around I never found anyone I was remotely interested in, let alone felt comfortable enough to let my guard down. Around Oct I met Jenny (via tinder, sad I know), she messaged me first and we started talking. I immediately got the feeling I was into her, and about a week or so later after talking every day we met to see a movie. And to make a long story not so short we hit it off right away, couldn't stop talking during the movie. Afterwords I walked her to her car, talked some more and then hugged. Without a second thought we kissed and like the sap I must be, time fucking stood still. We said goodbye and each went home. Later that night we're texting about how good the kiss was ( her words) and how much we each like each other. We stayed up till 1 am talking about how we each had been used and played in past relationships and how we both felt a connection to each other and an intimacy that both of us recognized as incredibly rare for either of us to experience. We even both agreed that we prefer sex to happen within a monogamous relationship versus sleeping around.


For the next couple months we have some awesome dates we're both really into each other. We're both pretty busy, her in college and me with a full time job, but nevertheless we (namely her) make time to hang out whenever we possibly can, including me driving her to and from the airport to return home for breaks and such. We find ourselves growing really close to each other and to my terror actually connecting and to me at least, falling for each other. She'd tell me all the time how special she thought I was, and cute and caring and how I'm always there for her. And likewise, I got a bruise from how hard I fell for her, she's incredibly smart, beautiful, caring, funny and essentially the girl of my dreams. So naturally at this point, I'm thinking she's way out of my league but I'm on cloud 9 because this amazing girl is actually into me.


Then everything comes crashing down one night in December when she's talking to me about some family problems and tells me that she can't handle a relationship right now. She goes on to say that she things I'm amazing and that she loves spending time with me, but that she can't handle the physical stuff and that she needs me there as a best friend and that I'm stability and support in her life that she doesn't have right now, but we could still hug and show pda but without the kissing. By now I have red flags going off left and right telling me that she's just using me. But the fact that I genuinely liked her as a person, not just as relationship material made me take the job as the support in her life. Mind you at this point we haven't gone past pretty heavy making out and fooling around, and honestly sex was the furthest thing from my mind, I was still battling trust issues and didn't try and press it and she never did either. So I'm in it now, and I take her to airport for winter break, aaannnd I barely hear from her for almost a month, mainly me texting her and getting few if any responses. But when its time for her to come back to school, guess who she calls for a ride. Turns out I couldn't give her one but I offer hang out when shes back into town. So that night we go out for food and some shopping to catch up. Things are going great and I end up saying something that caused her to kiss me, kinda caught me off guard but I'll take it.



So for the next couple weeks we hang out a little and have a great time. She'd even kiss me like she had never said she didn't wan't it, and me being the moron that I am I just go along with it. She thanks me over and over again for being there for her, and supporting her and being in her words amazing. All the while we're still technically in the friend zone if I had to guess. She decides to rush a sorority and me being the guy I am give her encouragement and support whenever I can during the process, albeit very little since when either of us get particularly busy we kinda go silent, but not for more than a couple days at a time. However over the course of the rush process, I'd send her texts of encouragement and support whenever I felt like she could use it.


To try and wrap this pointless story up, she gets in and is ecstatic, and I'm really happy for her. She tells me that she like me being there and appreciates the support. We hang out a few more times and each time we cuddle, make out and generally have an awesome time. She says she wants me to invite her to go rock climbing with me and I jump at the opportunity and offer that whenever she's free next I'd love to take her. We hang out one more time to watch a movie, everything goes like normal, and I text her a day or so later (around the end of Jan) to see how she is. We talk for a little and she just stops and I haven't heard from her since. She had told me several times how she loved that I didn't push or annoy her so naturally throughout our entire history I've tried to give her space and not try and be clingy.


But I guess what gets me is that we've both liked stuff each others posted to Facebook (lame I know) and I know that she knows I'm still into her. And I understand that she is busy with school, work, her sorority and the like. But I'm just so damn confused and scared I'm over thinking things to much, but if she was still into me, even remotely as a friend shouldn't she have at least tried to keep in contact. I feel like I'm over reacting and should just message her, but at the same time I think I put forth the effort and now I feel like I was just used again.


I'm sorry for the ramble, I mainly just typed this up to try and give myself a different perspective on the situation, but alas, that hasn't worked. If you actually read the entire thing I commend you and your fortitude. I'm sure I left a bunch out but I just kinda started typing instead of thinking. If anyone has any advice, comments or jokes at my expense please feel free to share them or else let this post sink into the deep dark depths of the internet never to be seen again.

Me and my girlfriend (we will call her Kelly) have been together for a little over a year. We met at work and were dating within 2 months. Kelly's one of the most genuine and awesome people I've ever met and we've had a great relationship with no arguments up to this point. I can honestly see myself marrying this woman because of her great qualities, though it is obviously much too soon for that. She quit her job in the company we worked for a few months into our relationship and spent a good portion of last and this year studying.

She has recently gone back to work for a firm and this is where the current issue starts. She met John (not real name) [30M] at work as he is one of her supervisors. I will mention that really everyone within the company is technically her supervisor and he is not her direct supervisor in that he generally does not give her work to do and she does not report to him. Recently I found out that a few of John's coworkers asked Kelly if she would hang out with John after work. Basically I found out that John has a crush on Kelly. She obviously told them that she has a BF and would not be able to and they dropped the issue.

Today I've found out that John has been buying her gum everyday and she has been accepting. I know that John is aware Kelly and me are dating and that Kelly is not interested in him but it's still bothering me a little. The main reason I feel like it is bothering me is because I've used to do the same exact thing when we were working together. I would buy Kelly gum before we started dating and then after we started dating all the way up until she left the company. Granted it's something that is extremely silly and shouldn't bother me but I feel like John isn't doing this just to be friendly but because he likes her.

Kelly is obviously aware that John likes her but doesn't see the issue as to her it's just gum, but it's made me feel insecure that she does not shut him down. I feel like it will give John hope that maybe something romantic might happen in the future since she's ok with them talking and accepts his gifts.

Another part of me feels like this is just gum and it's silly for me to be bothered by it. I don't know how to broach the subject or even if I should broach the subject to begin with because part of me feels like this is just my insecurity making a big deal out of nothing. Please tell me I'm making something out of nothing here Reddit.

Last night my flatmate, Steve, of 2 months made his sexual intentions very clear to me and made me feel unsafe and uncomfortable. I'm wondering how to proceed and address it with him so we can hopefully stay at least acquaintances and not disturb the balance of our flat.  



I'll try to give some context first: 



I'm an American student living in Norway, finishing my Bachelor's degree. I lived in a mixed gender uni flat with 15 other people. 7 girls/8 guys- all of them Norwegian. Everyone gets on really well, and some have been friends from before I arrived so they planned to live in our flat purposefully together. These existing friendships make it difficult for me to break into the social scene of our flat because I don't speak Norwegian and I don't know everyone as well as they know each other.



I do have one really good friend in the flat, Matt. Just this week, even though we have kept our relationship only on friendly terms since moving in together 2 months ago, we slept together. We both revealed our feelings for each other and agreed that we should continue our relationship as something more than friends but have not determined what that means yet. Everyone in our flat is aware of our relationship and agrees with it comfortably. 



On Wednesday, Matt left for a rugby tournament in northern Norway until Sunday(today). I was missing him, but not really that much until last night when I realized I needed someone on my side after becoming incredibly uncomfortable in my flat. So here's what happened:



Last night, my other flatmate, Steve, got really drunk with the rest of the flat before going to a big concert on campus at our student union. Everyone in Norway drinks excessively, especially at uni and sometimes one's personality can change to an exact opposite of who they are sober. I did not participate in the drinking and was completely sober when I came out of my room to make dinner, thinking everyone had left already. However, Steve was swaying drunkenly all over the kitchen and chatting with me flirtatiously. 



I did not reciprocate these feelings. I was mostly laughing at him while cooking my dinner. About 10 minutes into my cooking I realized he looked really sick, so I fried some eggs and told him to sit down. We ate together and had good chats about politics, life on campus, etc. (something we rarely do because he’s so shy sober) and then he mentions Matt and how he was jealous of our relationship, wishing he could have something like that with a girl. I said I was happy with how things were going between Matt and I, but that I didn't want to discuss my personal life because it wasn't his business, then reaffirmed that he would get lucky someday. 



Steve then left to rejoin the rest of our flatmates at the concert, thanking me for the meal and how caring I was to him. Fast forward to three hours later...
(This gets random but bear with me) I am hosting guests from another uni that are in the same sorority as me here on campus. I don't know these girls at all but we are all part of a buddy travel program through our sorority so I'm hosting them for the weekend while they enjoy the concert and parties.



They came home last night with Steve and were complaining that our communal living room was too unclean to sleep in after they'd had pre-drinks there before the concert. They wanted me to clean it up, so they came into my room while I was asleep and woke me up. I came out of my room in my kind of sexy night dress thinking Steve and my other male flatmates had gone to bed and started cleaning. 



Next thing I know Steve is standing behind me telling me he wants to talk to me. So I finish up the cleaning, get my sorority sisters situated and go into the kitchen to talk to him. He says this quote, in perfect English despite being a relatively mute speaker otherwise:



I just want to do you. Just once, ya know? You should know that. I would cook you breakfast. Why do you have to be with FWB? I'm a good guy too.



I was so freaked by this comment as he's has never before said anything along these lines to me. I went to my room and started to write my best friend as to how I felt by text. Approximately 30 minutes later I hear the door to my room open and I call out to see who's there. It's Steve. 



He walks into my room with his shirt unbuttoned and asks me if everything is ok, if he can help me with anything, or if I need him. I say bluntly and sternly, no, I'm fine and to please leave. He lingered looking at me and then left. Considering this was 4am, I would typically be asleep so I not only feel violated about him coming in without knocking, but the fact that he did so assuming I would be sleeping creeps me out even more. 



As I'm trying to discuss what just happened with my friend over text, I get a snapchat from Steve. I open it and it is him laying shirtless in his bed with text reading in Norwegian Come join the party. This disgusts me as he is clearly overstepping his boundaries. 



Five minutes later....Another snapchat. This time it's him with his eyes closed touching himself. No text. I am horrified and I don't want to open the third one that came five minutes after that. I took screen shots of all of them (except the third which I'm too afraid to open because I think it's a dick pic) and wrote down everything that transpired leading up to this in my notebook.



As of this afternoon, I plan to speak to him about it because I want to resolve my feelings. I have never felt unsafe in my flat. Everyone is respectful of people's privacy and no one even locks their door because we all feel so comfortable. Last night, I barricaded my door with my desk and locked it so no one could get in, even though my sorority sisters needed use of the bathroom, because I felt that unsafe. And I considered talking to them about all this but I couldn't really lean on them in this situation because they were also drunk and I don't know them well enough to want to scare them while staying here or rope them into the dramas of my flat.


But anyway, today Matt gets back from his trip and I'm going to talk to him about everything that happened, because if he was here I could have resolved this with his help and would have felt safe with him by my side. However, my anxiety is that I will appear to be leaning on him too much because we are not in an exclusive relationship and as an independent female I'm not asking him to step up and be some protector boyfriend type but I feel like he'll construe it that way.  



I guess my questions, or thoughts, are the following: 



How should I talk to Steve? Especially if he was blackout drunk and can't remember his actions? Do I show him the evidence? Should I involve Matt in talking to him so this is a united front about respecting privacy in the flat and not just a personal attack situation on Steve? Should I move out if it's possible that Steve really feels this way and will continue his actions, because we all get drunk every weekend? 



I should also mention that while traveling in Norway last Christmas break I was very nearly raped by my couchsurfing host, so last night definitely brought up some of those memories and unresolved feelings as I felt threatened in my own house with nowhere else to go. 



I hate to feel like I'm overreacting but I could really use anyone's advice about how to proceed. Culturally, because of my nationality I already feel at a disadvantage because I can't talk to Steve properly in Norwegian about this, but Norwegians have some of the most equal thinking mentalities on feminism I have ever encountered and he speaks English well enough. 



Ok I'm rambling now, I'll just look out for any advice you guys have as I'm pretty much paralyzed by what to do next or how to begin to address the situation.

**tl;dr**: My flatmate of 2 months, Steve, came home drunk last night, hit on me profusely, came into my room without asking, sent me naked pictures of himself masturbating and confessed that he wants to sleep with me despite him knowing I have feelings and a relationship currently with our other flatmate. How can I tell him his actions made me feel unsafe and personally violated? Should I consider involving my FWB flatmate Matt when I speak to Steve(since Matt is Norwegian)? Should I consider moving out to avoid this happening again?

261,3ilxye,"Currently, I live at home with my mom while I work full time, go to school part time, and save for my own place.  I pay rent, pay for my own phone, my own car insurance, and come November, I will be on my own health insurance policy.

My mom and I have not always seen eye-to-eye on things, but overall, I'd like to think we have an okay relationship.

Last night, she was telling me that I don't help out enough around the house, mainly with cleaning.  I can see where she is coming from because I'm not around on weekends (Friday after work to Sunday afternoons).  I work roughly an hour away, so I leave around 6:30 am and I'm home anywhere between 6 and 7 pm (depending on traffic).  Once I'm home, I have dinner with the family, which is about a half hour, then I have classwork I need to do.  I also try to get to sleep between 10 and 11.  So I'm home roughly 30-40 waking hours.

When I'm home, I'm mainly in my room, the shared bathroom with my 15 yr old brother, kitchen or laundry room.  I don't really use the living room since my mom hangs out there mainly and watched TV shows I don't care to watch usually.  The loft in the house is my brother's man-cave.  The areas I use, I keep fairly clean and help with the dishes and laundry.

My mom can be passive-aggressive, which can make communicating logically a little difficult.  Last night, she admitted to leaving the vacuum out upstairs to see how long it would take before I would vacuum.  Where the vacuum was located, I thought she had put it there to keep it out of the way until this weekend, when *someone* would take care of it and vacuum the upstairs.  So it was out 3 days.  We've talked in the past about cleaning chores between her, me and my brother.  Vacuuming upstairs was for me OR my brother.  So to me, I don't see it being a huge deal that it was out for a couple days.  My mom also likes things her way now or not at all.

I know her and I also have different cleaning standards. For example, she prefers to dust every weekend, whereas, I will dust every other weekend, maybe every 3 weeks.  I figure, since I'm the only one going in my room, why should I meet her standards of clean?

I talked with my boyfriend about this situation looking for suggestions on compromising, but he couldn't come up with any, because he thinks that since I pay rent, I do plenty by keeping my areas clean, plus helping with laundry and dishes.

925,25m0c8,"This is probably a common question for most Redditters, but I myself have no idea how to handle this situation.

Me and my girlfriend have been together for a little over 6 months now. She has always been a very loose person before she met me, making out with random guys/girls (she's bisexual) every week, sometimes multiples in one evening. This is the first serious relationship she has been in.

As far as I know she never kissed another guy since she's with me(she did kiss a few girls but I told her I'm fine with that) .


But I remember in the first month of our relationship that she told me that she wouldn't go hunting for guys, but that she couldn't promise me that if a guy kisses her that she wouldn't kiss him back. 


She tells me it's just kissing, and that she likes the thrill but that it doesn't mean anything for her, (Of the hundreds of guys she made out with she only slept with 4/5 of them) and that she will not do it if it hurts me, I think she's being honest with this.

We usually go to parties together, sometimes I watch her when she thinks I'm somewhere else just to check if she's honest with me, and so far I haven't seen her doing anything inappropriate. 


The problem is she says she still likes flirting a bit with guys, because she likes the attention (she calls it her private time), but there's no way she will kiss them. I'm not sure if I should be fine with it or not. I trust that she won't do anything when I'm with her on the same party, but obviously we won't always go together.


Sometimes I feel like I should also start flirting with random girls, but I feel that if I start doing this as well, that it will inevitably destroy our relationship. 


Additional info: Every time I'm talking to a random girl she asks me who it is and what we were talking about (honestly I don't flirt with them, one of my first lines is usually that I have a girlfriend so that they don't get the wrong impression), so her whole flirting and kissing is fine as long as there's no feelings attitude doesn't really seem to be counting for me.


Am I overreacting here? I know every girl likes attention, I try to give her as much as possible and usually it's enough for her, but every now and then she also wants some attention from other guys. I'm just not sure if it will always stay just flirting.

EDIT: To clarify, she later apologized for her statement I can't promise that if a guy kisses me I won't kiss him back and promised me she would never let any guy do that.

530,1hfjbr,"So last year I dated my ex for almost a year until we eventually broke up.  At the time I started dating her I had just gotten a pretty demanding job in NYC, and was struggling to get used to the hours, the schedule, and the shock of being in a big city.  At that point I was fresh out of college and looking back on it, really had a lot of growing up to do. 

So I met her and we fell in love hard.  Choirs sangs, angels wept, etc. We started hanging out a lot and kind of developed that husband/wife type relationship.  She was over a year out of a 4 year relationship that was emotional abusive towards the second half.  She hasn't gone into too much detail, but from what I know he became an alcoholic, started treating her badly, until eventually she broke up with him.

Our first 9 months together were great, we were that young couple in love.  We spent holidays at each other's houses (a little premature looking back on it), and were great to one another.  We seldom argued.  We had issues though that never really manifested themselves until communication completely broke down.  We were too eager to please one another and eventually I felt like we couldn't communicate with one another because of it. 

I was under a lot of pressure at work, and I wasn't mature enough to do the balancing act of work, family, friends, and a girlfriend all at once.  Especially when she struggled to communicate with me. So I broke up with her.

Looking back on it as well, I had some really idealistic views about what a relationship should/shouldn't be.  Once the honeymoon phase wore off, I ended things because I took that as a sign that things were going south.   I was under a lot of pressure and completely folded.  

We have been broken up for about 6 months now.  During that time we've spoken on and off.  I haven't really been able to move past her or get over her even though technically I'm the one who ended things.  I'm not sure if I ever really wanted to.

Anyway, she has been seeing a therapist since March.  She says she has some unresolved issues from her previous relationship and she's been working on things like communication etc.. 

We've been texting a little bit, and I can honestly say I notice a big difference.  We're open and candid with one another.  Even the little things, like the stuff we talk about is different and in a more real life and larger scope rather than us being the stars of our own Disney love tale.  

As far as I go, I've gotten MUCH better at dealing with things day to day.  I'm comfortable at work, and I can juggle a lot more things.  I felt like I'm getting over that hump from the college type days to adulthood.

Last Thursday we went out and hacked some balls at the driving range, and talked for a while in her car afterwards.  We got lunch yesterday too. I'm starting to feel like we've both grown in our individual ways and that I want to give it another shot.  Thing is, I'm scared, because I don't want the same feelings to resurface and end up down the same path again.

665,1yd45u,"Hey reddit, 

I need a little advice, there is a girl (20 F) that used to be a study buddy in a couple of my university classes that I was into. She's a pretty shy girl and it seems like she doesn't have too much experience dealing with the opposite sex but that's all speculation. I tried to make subtle moves during our study sessions but she never really caught on until one night (last friday) I saw her out at a pub and I made a move on her and she reciprocated. Important note, she was DDing for a friend and was sober that night so I think the thought process was straight.

After dancing I made a move to kiss her and she told me she saw me as a friend at first but now she was unsure. I said some things and we ended up making out that night. Great everything seemed like it was working for my favour. I texted her the day after saying it was great seeing her last night and she replied the same.

However I tried texting her again two days ago with a simple Hey and I received no reply. We're on a week vacation right now from school so I won't see her in person into monday but I'm a little confused on the no reply. I think I actually like her emotionally and physically and want to try to take our once casual relationship further.

Now I'm in a bind, should I text her back with another Hey, how's it going or something to that effect. Or should I just leave it and maybe just try to talk to her this monday.

Right from the get go I support her decision whether she wants to stay and find another advisor, or move to the midwest.  She ultimately decides that she wouldn't be happy doing the available research in California and moves with her advisor to the midwest.  I decide that the only way we will have a chance at working out is if I quit my PhD program, switch to a master's degree, and move with her.  I constantly try and support her by telling her I will stand by her no matter what.

We have huge fights about how she doesn't think I'll actually move and how her ex told her the same thing when she moved to California (Their relationship ended when he decided not to move).  When I tell her I'm hesitant, she tells me it will be a better career move for me and backs it up with anecdotal evidence from my current lab.  I claim it was not just a career move for me to get my PhD but also a life goal.  Eventually I come to terms with this change but clearly by writing this I feel like there is a feeling deep down that I'm afraid she doesn't support me.  

Now that she has moved, she has become depressed.  She left her friends, her family, and me in California, and now she is having a tough time adjusting to the midwest.  I help as I can by staying in with her, we play video games together to try and stay connected, but of course long distance is always tough.  We also have flown to see each other every month since she moved.

Ever since she moved though, we get into constant fights.  A lot of it stems from her problems with me.  Recently (3 weeks ago), she told me how she isn't satisfied with me, and how there are problems with me that she has suppressed in order to stay with me.  We break up, but ultimately I convince her that we should stay together.

  After fighting about this issue for a long time, she tells me that it is because I don't show her new things.  She is much more adventurous than me and has shown me a lot of new hobbies.  She claimed she doesn't want that burden alone.  She likens it to smoking: If you like someone who smokes, it's okay to tell someone to stop right? So it should be okay to tell someone that they have something wrong with them?  This resonated with me, so I agree and decide to pick up gardening.  We both agree to these terms and continue on.  Unfortunately she will still tell me during fights that she has to put up with so much to be happy with me.  But she claims that if the good didn't outweigh the bad, she wouldn't be with me.

The problem is, every time we fight, she will tell me that there is something wrong with me.  In my mind, the fight won't end unless I take the high road and try and apologize for any grievance I caused her.  She claims that I am the fighter in the relationship because I am the strong one.  She understands that I keep the relationship together by sticking up for our relationship when she wants to take a break or when she loses her temper, but claims she can't do anything about it because it's not her job.

She's not a bad girlfriend and definitely not a bad person.  She has done a lot for me to help me move, and has tried her best to make me happy.  I have made my fair share of mistakes in the relationship as well, and kind of hate posting this because I know that as unbiased as I try to be, this is really only my side of the story.  We are just both at our wit's end.  I have tried to change to accommodate her, but it doesn't seem to be working.  I am completely lost and have no idea what to do next.

We're going to offer the landlord a bigger deposit and more rent monthly, if it comes to that. But if the answer still was no, I assumed we'd keep looking for another place. While filling out the application, he turned to me and said, I really want this place. If they won't let us have the cat we're gonna just have to find a good home for her.

I met this girl through an illustration she submitted to DeviantART three months ago. She'd put up a picture of her character from Destiny and we hit it off from there. We both main Titans, enjoy the same primary weapon, etc. I added her on PSN and over the course of the next few weeks we've become pretty good friends. Much better than I'd ever expected given the situation.

Fast forward to New Year's Eve. I always stay up all night as a tradition of my own and I'd mentioned this to her. She's a natural night owl so she liked the idea too. We stayed up all night together, played Destiny, as well as a great round of 20 Questions to get to know each other and pass the time. Over the course of the night and the following day we admit to each other that we like other person. She even went so far as to say that she thinks we have a pretty good connection. We're currently playing a sex edition of 20 Questions (my dumb idea that she liked the sound of) and having a pretty damn good time. I mean, we'll be in a PSN party for hours and have an awesome time. 

The problem is though as I'm learning more and more about her the weirder it's making me feel. She's said that after some bad experiences with past relationships she's not a relationship person anymore. I genuinely like relationships, even though my past two have been pretty crappy. She's also said that she's not a hugger and, surprise, surprise, I just happen to be. Another issue is that of sex. Over the course of both games I've learned that she's had quite a bit whereas I haven't had any. While it isn't a complete turn off, as someone with a religious background it does bother me a little. 

I also realize their is an inherent likelihood for nothing really to happen, especially given the fact that she lives in Tennessee and I live in Michigan. I genuinely like this girl and she seems to genuinely like me (albeit seemingly a tad hesitant to admit it based on her past). My past two relationships have been screw ups. I **don't** want this one to be one too. Granted, we've come nowhere close to even talking about that but the point still stands.

I dated this girl for about a month three years ago. Very quickly into the relationship I realized that I didn't want to be with her - for a rather shallow reason. I wasn't comfortable having her around my friends because I didn't think she was cool enough - or rather, I thought my friends would think she was weird. And she is weird - in a way that I like, but in a way that didn't really fit in with my circle of friends at the time (I have better friends now though). I also doubted whether or not I found her attractive enough to be with her long-term (maybe that's shallow too, but it was what it was). So I broke up with her and she was hurt, but she's since become one of my closest friends. I made out with her once in 2012 - it was completely out of the blue; we were both sober and neither of us have spoken about it. I was in a year-long relationship since then, and she's in a relationship currently.

One thing I've noticed is that whenever we talk, I feel...flirty. Just a little bit lighter in the chest, witty as shit, and I feel like things just flow. I also know her incredibly well, so we can talk about important things. However, I don't want to date her. I don't think it would work out long-term, and I wouldn't want to damage our friendship (aside from the fact that she already has a bf - one that I'm really happy she has, because he's so good to her). And I'd be too afraid to hurt her again; she's too...innocent and tender-hearted.

My question is, what do I do with this feeling of unfinished business that I have with her? As I'm writing this I think I'm beginning to realize that I'm probably still attracted to her on some level...do I talk to her about this? 

It's weird because I think about her as a friend, not an ex. Ex-girlfriend is just not a term that I feel fits her, because the relationship never got serious and it was so long ago. She's been nothing but a really good friend to me. A really good friend that I might have feelings for but don't want to date.

Do I talk to my friend about what I've been feeling? We're usually pretty in tune with each other so I wouldn't be surprised if she feels it too.

One detail is that they're all muslim and I'm an atheist, but I respect their beliefs and never question them or talk about mine.

I was perfectly happy like this and care a *lot* for all of them. We spent the great majority of our time studying together. The only thing that bothered me was that they were never interested in hanging out when it had nothing to do with studying. Even after practically begging when I was at my worst, it wouldn't work. Ugh... Suddenly typing this out I realized it was a red flag back then. But I felt so happy and safe being with people whom I thought cared about me as much as I cared about them (been lonely for a big part of my life as you can tell). 

One friend (let's call her Laila, she has an incredibly calm and sweet personality) making annoying but well-intentionned remarks about why I should convert, such as I can't show you pictures of me because I can't show my hair to a non-muslim girl. or why I don't have a big happy family like they do But if you converted, every muslim person would be a family member to you. And telling me not to go to parties or making me miss events, coincidentally having reservations towards other people I'd connect with in our year and advising me not to become close to them... Stupidly, I listened because they implied there were very good reasons... Recently found out ALL the reasons were really minor and silly things, but they couldn't describe them and acted so ominous about it because it's irreligious to speak behind the back of other people, no matter how much you want to. Sorry but you need to respect this.

...

But on the other hand, Laila and another of them (say... Iman) kept talking about *how much* she wanted to do humanitarian work together. Hell yes, it was also my dream of many years! To me, it proved they were good people and friends despite their minor flaws. So I'm working hard to organize this, find a hospital, ... Only downside is that it's dangerous if you're alone. Iman is apparently not allowed by her parents though and too cowardly to tell me before it's too late, and Laila just... Suddenly willingly decides she wants a arranged wedding with a guy she's met once and to spend time making preparations instead of going with me. Knew for two months but tells me too late to change plans or find new people, so I had to cancel very reluctantly... And I must keep her engagement secret from everyone else so I can't explain to any other friend!! I'm now working so hard to find hospital training elsewhere.

I realize it's partly my fault for trying to have close loved ones at all costs, I'm not asking for undeserved sympathy, but for advice on how to deal with the drama. They're my coworkers and classmates as well, so stupid unnecessary drama is a bad idea. I wish I could either plain forgive them, or break all ties in anger but it's not the right thing to do. Sorry for the walls of text but I think I needed this to figure this out and the odds are that no one will read this anyway... Given their personalities I know shit will hit the fan as soon as lessons begin again. And we're supposed to hang out just the five of us away from everyone else.

He showed me texts from her where she said how hot she thinks he is and all this other crap about them hanging out. I told my BF that their relationship made me extremely uncomfortable and asked him to respond to the text she sent him about hanging out saying that he has a girlfriend and it would be inappropriate. He wouldn't, saying it was awkward but he told me he would stop responding to her. Since then we have been much better, and i have periodically asked him about her and if they have been talking and he always said no.

Not really sure where to start so I'll just start here - My Dad used to be insanely fit and active when he was around my age (I know this from pictures, stories, etc), and until about 3 years ago, I was too. I then had issues with depression and got tubby (~18 Stone, 64, now down to 16 Stone). My Dad has been large for *my* entire life, but in the last few years has become a lot heavier. Judging by our similar height I would guess he is maybe 25 Stone. I hate to say it, but he's the largest person I know personally.

He needs to lose weight, he knows this, but he needs to be kicked into gear.

I do know about healthy eating, proper exercise, etc, and I'm sure he does too so that's not really an issue. The issue is how I tell him something needs to be done and soon.

As he has had hip operations on both hips, I don't think running would be best for him. I'm an avid Mountain Biker and thought maybe I could get him out doing some trails with me, but as I only ride Downhill I don't have a Cross Country/Road bike. He has an old one but I'm not sure it's the correct height for him.

We're with the same friends and go to the same concerts, so I end up seeing her hook up with other guys, and I know she was texting one of them about having sex on the beach.

I know I was wrong, and I feel guilty, there’s a lot of context to the situation that isn’t worth going into detail about. The one detail I will give, is that the girlfriend, “Suzie,” was the girl I had been “competing” with for 2 years, before my ex, “Eric” and I officially dated.

Anyway, once Suzie figured it out, she asked me if I could put our past aside, and just talk about what happened. I agreed, and we ended up talking for 5 hours. I felt really guilty for what I had done, and we both ended up apologizing about the entire ordeal with Eric (he cheated on me with her, as well). We both agreed that Eric needed to be alone, so he could feel even just half as awful and heartbroken as he’s made us feel for the past three years.

Even though we bonded, she promised she wouldn’t forgive him and would kick him out of their apartment (they were living together, he doesn’t have a job so she pays for everything), I’m still really worried that she might fall for his lies. In the past, Suzie’s had issues with codependency, and I know she’s extremely in love with him (more than I have ever been), so I know despite what she says, she wants it to work. She showed me all the texts of sweet things he was saying to her after the fact, and he said those exact things to me when I caught him cheating too. He’s without a doubt the most manipulative person I’ve ever met.

This all happened shortly before thanksgiving, and she ended up still going on a trip with his family because she told me she wasn’t ready to face all the questions by her family. While I understood where she was coming from, I didn’t completely understand why she would want to hang out with her cheating boyfriend and his family for a week. 

At the moment, I’m unsure whether she kicked him out or not (she said he was moving out when they got back from the trip) and I’m too worried to text her. Every time I text her, I feel like I’m being annoying and nosey (I guess I am), but honestly I just want her to make the right decision. Eric has cheated on every girlfriend he’s ever had… no matter what he says.

How can I be supportive and make sure she understands this? I’m at a loss, and I don’t want to seem pushy or demanding.

I almost feel as though my best course of action would be to not text her at all, so then she might worry Eric and I are talking again (we’re not), so that she realizes she will never be able to trust him.

My biggest personal insecurity is that I am not very attractive. I'm 15-20 pounds overweight, but working on getting rid of it. I'm currently 170 pounds at 5'7.5, and used to be 190. My face is okay, but not beautiful by any means.

The next issue is the dynamics of our social group. In our major, everyone is really close, but the junior class (which he is in) is especially close. This class includes his ex-girlfriend of one year, who I am also good friends with. Knowing the both of them, there isn't danger of them getting back together, but they still hang out and are friends with the whole group. He's really close with this group, and I am friends with all of them individually, but don't usually hang out with them all together. 

My final problem is just not knowing whether there is a chance he could reciprocate my feelings. He is extremely friendly and kind to everyone, so it's hard to tell if he specifically is interested in me. I've noticed that he will casually touch or hug me a lot, but then again, he does that to his other friends, too. (Theatre people, man. They're a touchy group.)

I present the evidence that he may or may not like me: 

* He specifically tries to sit by me in classes—but again, not a lot to go on. We joke around a lot and get along really well, so it might just be that it's fun when we sit together. 

* We went on a trip to Europe together for school last year and had a marvelous time and got to know each other way better, but he was with his ex at the time (and she was on the trip too. And is a really lovely person). 

* Just the other day after a party I was upset about something and he was very kindly trying to comfort me and was hugging/holding me and kissed the top of my head (lol), but maybe it was just him being friendly. 

* We text/snapchat/facebook message occasionally, but it's almost always initiated by me. 

* About a month ago, someone told me he had a crush on my roommate, but that was before he knew she had a boyfriend. 

This post has been all over the place. I would just love an outside perspective. I never really talk to my best friend about dating stuff—it's like the one thing we just never touch for some reason—and I can't talk to the people in our major about it. I really like this guy, but I would hate to completely have the wrong impression from him and find out he's not into me at all. That's the worst-case scenario—that I tell him how I feel, and he is horrified and we stop being friends and I'm cut off from the rest of our mutual friends as well.

568,2xll4n,"Hi Reddit,
I've been feeling like my relationship is becoming less like a relationship, and more like two good friends who sleep together. This was making me feel really lonely and unsatisfied, because I felt as though our relationship wasn't developing or progressing in any way. My partner and I live together, but we flat with his best friend (M, 24). I feel as though the dynamics of our relationship isn't any different to his and his and his friend's relationship, and I want to feel like more than a friend.

,

So I realised what was missing. There was no romance, no relationship building, nothing to symbolise that our love was romantic.

,

I explained this to my partner, who never really been interested in romantic gestures. He ignores Valentine's day, and isn't interested in card giving or doing anything special on other holidays (Christmas, birthdays, etc).

,

I told him I wanted more romance in our relationship, and that by romance I didn't mean I wanted him to buy things or take me out for dinner (he's a poor student, whereas I work). I just wanted to do things, just the two of us, that were date like in nature. Because his best friend is always around, everything we do is with him too. He's a nice guy, but sometimes I feel as though I'm dating both of them. Spending quality time with my partner is hard.

,

This weekend was the last weekend before uni starts, and I told him I wanted us to go on a date before he got too busy and stressed with course work. He's in his last year of a very intense degree. He said absolutely, that we should definitely do something. He said he had a list of things for us to do, and he sounded so excited about it. I was really excited! 

,

We ended up going to some building suppliers and looking at saws and wood he wanted for his projects. We then went shopping for things he needed for uni. Don't get me wrong, I had a lot of fun, but I didn't think that was the date he had in mind. Then he came home and went to sleep.

,

I got irrationally upset, and I tried to hide it from him, because he seemed so satisfied that the day had gone really well. I did have a good day, but I was frustrated that his idea of a date was walking and driving all over town looking for things for him for his hobbies and school work. There was no talking or relationship building, no warm fuzzy feelings. I still just felt like his friend.

,

I'm scared that this is it as far as romance goes for us. When I told him it wasn't what I expected, that I didn't expect his exciting-sounding list of date ideas to be just one thing - us going shopping at hardware stores - he got angry, and that made me angry. 

,

When we made friends again, he promised we'd go out for dinner later on in the week. But he promises that a lot. When I told him last month I was sad he didn't want to spend time together on Valentines day, he promised we'd do something romantic the following Monday. But on Monday he said he was too tired to go out. The last time we talked about going on dates more and spending more time together, he said we'd do something in the weekend. But again, he was too tired.

,

Other than that, our relationship is perfect. We watch movies together almost every night (with his friend), we make each other laugh, we cook dinner for each other (and his friend), we support each other and help each other with projects and hobbies.

,

But it just doesn't feel like a romantic relationship anymore, and I don't know how to fix it. 

,

**tl;dr**: Boyfriend's idea of a big, special, hyped up date was going to hardware stores and looking at wood and saws (which was fun, because I always have fun with him, but it didn't feel like a date at all). Boyfriend has a habit of hyping up 'dates' and then not following through. I'm upset that this might be 'it' for romance in our relationship. Is there any way to fix it?

An example is, just recently she got some bad news from her school. She called me saying she got bad news and would like to talk to me about it. So we talk about it and I try my best to be supportive. 

The problem is the way she reacts to support. If I offer a solution off the top of my head of what she can do, she replies with ARE YOU IMPLYING I AM NOT ALREADY DOING THAT? to give an example. If I am hopeful about the future and say everything will be fine she replies NO IT WONT, X Y Z. If I say im sorry to hear that she replies WELL THAT DOESNT HELP. If I stay quiet as some people just wanna offload their problems without hearing anything, she says WELL DO YOU PLAN ON SAYING ANYTHING OR ARE YOU JUST GONNA SIT THERE?.

---------------------------------

Sorry this is my first time posting in here so this post may be a little too long, just look at the TLDR at the bottom if you don't feel like reading the whole thing. Would appreciate your advice either way thanks in advance! 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So me and my girlfriend were best friends all of high school and finally started dating senior year. While we got a long super well and had great conversations and were just in love, we would also cut school all the time and have a lot of sex. (It was senior year so it didn't really matter).


We started off as friends with benefits and eventually fell in love and started dating. She hadn't done anything with anyone else other than kiss, I had gone further with other girls but never sex. Basically, we both lost our virginitys to each other and fell in love it was all special and all that corny stuff. My family loved her, my friends loved her and I loved her. 


The first year of college was constantly fighting and making up and TONS of sex. We basically lived with each other and our grades and friendships suffered because of it. We actually made almost no friends the first year as we were always together. This caused more fights but we always got past it.


The second year we vowed to fix all our problems and give each other space. We wanted each other to make our own friends and meet other people and actually experience college. I lived in an off-campus house with my friends and she was in a dorm. A lot of guys were coming onto her and I got pretty jealous, a couple were genuinely good guys but others had obvious intentions. She got annoyed that I was so controlling and we would have fights over that. 


We also had a lot less sex compared to the past year because whenever I came over she had friends in her dorm and hated walking all the way to my house. 


Then we got into a huge fight, where she broke up with me for something dumb and said we were over forever. I begged her to reconsider or at the least make it a one week break and talk about it after a week. 


Then the next day, she thought I tried to get with some girl at a party (I just talked to some girl at a party and flirted just to see if I could still be single but had no other intentions) and said we were over forever and that she was going to go out that night to a party. I was at home at the time and tried desperately to text or call her but to no avail.


We ended up breaking up for almost a month. I tried to get her back for the first three weeks and kept failing. Tons of guys swarmed to her now that she was single, including a couple of my friends which really hurt. This whole time, I was out of my mind depressed. I couldn't sleep at night, or would wake up to nightmares, I wouldn't eat and lost 15 pounds, whenever I drank I would blackout and do something stupid. I kept texting her thinking I could get her back but kept failing. 


I texted her the whole time and she kept flirting with the idea of being together but not committing to anything. She would talk about an open relationship and call me over for sex, and like a puppy dog I would go. She told me she made out with one of the guys from her hall that night she went out. It hurt me so much it was ridiculous. Yet the hope of us back together was the only thing keeping me sane.


Finally after three weeks she said it was over and that we were beating a dead horse and talking and meeting up is dumb and we should stop. I lost it and tried to do something stupid and take my own life, and thank god my friends found me and stopped me and got me help.


At that point I cut all contact with her for almost three weeks. I reconnected with my friends and family, focused on my grades, started eating really healthy and started going to the gym almost everyday. I also started going to counseling which helped a little as well.  


She ended out reaching out to me after almost 40 days of us breaking up. We talked and met up, and still had strong feelings for each other. 


I asked her if she had sex with anyone else and she said no and neither had I. We ended up getting back together and it was magical. It was just like our old relationship except we had our own lives, our own friends and weren't controlling. We ended up having sex tons of times and it was awesome. We went to a party and had a GREAT time. IT WAS PERFECT. I WAS HAPPY. 


Then for some reason I went through her facebook when it was open. I found out the day after we broke up, when she was angry at me, she went to a party that one of the guys in the hall invited her to. She danced with him all night and made out with him, like she said. But then they came back to the dorm and ended up having sex in the laundry room; on the laundry room table. He ate her out and then they had sex. I knew because they talked about it on facebook the next day and how his shirt buttons were all over the place and how they were 1-1 for fucking in the laundry room. I found out they were talking about becoming fuck buddies, but ended up not going through with it. 


I told her I knew and that it was over and tried to leave. She blocked the door and she started bawling and begging for me to stay. I made her tell me every detail of the night and what exactly happened. She told me everything. She also said it was only physical and just to get over me because she thought we were over. That they didn't do anything again, and that she stopped talking to him three weeks ago. That she loved me, and that we went to the same college together, that we were supposed to get married. 


Since then I ended up forgiving her but it just hasn't been the same. We spent the rest of that weekend together and when I wasn't yelling at her and us getting into a fight about it, I couldn't focus on anything but that image and keep getting really depressed. 
I believe her that it was only physical, but the fact that she did that with someone else, especially an asshole like him 3 days after meeting him. Something she ONLY did with me after 4 years of us knowing each other?


Also sex was our entire relationship, WE ONLY DID IT WITH EACH OTHER. We did it constantly and it kept us together. And then she just does it with some random guy she just met?


Now every time we meet I yell at her and get extremely upset and mad and we fight and then make up, which both of us are quickly getting sick of. 



Every time we have sex that's all I can think of. Beyond that when I'm not with her I get depressed and constantly imagine the laundry room and that happening. Random words make me think about it and upset me. I feel bipolar, as sometimes I completely over it and the next second I'm depressed. The only thing that makes me feel better, is talking to other girls and the almost fantasy/idea of cheating on her the next chance I get which is so fucked up. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


I want to forgive her, I want it to work, I want to be happy but I just can't get the image out of my head and can't help but getting depressed thinking about it CONSTANTLY. I was just wondering if anyone has any advice on how to get over something like this.

TLDR: Great relationship with girlfriend from highschool but is very based on sex. (Only have had sex with each other). Date for two years and then finally break up after tons of fighting. Two months later, we end up getting back together and the break perfectly solves a lot of problems and results in a lot happier relationship. BOTH OF US ARE JUST HAPPY. I find out she had sex with someone a day after we broke up, but broke it off three weeks ago. I want to forget about it and just enjoy our relationship but can't. I'm miserable all the time as I keep imagining it and fight when I'm with her. I don't know if I can get over it or ever forgive her.


I trust her completely that she would never cheat on me or anything, its just getting over the past that I'm finding way too hard.

150,2219ah,"Hi, so I know this seems a little silly; I know that I have to be patient and understanding and let a lot go during this time, but I'm getting irritable and I need some perspective to help me stay cool (and mature!) about all this. I'm pretty good about letting things go, but right now is a really stressful time for me and for him. I've got a lot of family problems going on, and last week was an extremely sad/hard week for me, but he was very supportive and loving. I'm doing better this week. As for him, he's dealing with job stress - he's graduating soon and gets extremely stressed about interviews and the like. Only thing is he does not handle stress well at all. He gets very irritable, has a shorter fuse than normal, and becomes pretty distant. I understand why, everyone handles stress of any kind in their own way - I cry and get sensitive, he gets touchy and has a temper. I've been good about giving him space and understanding he isn't going to be very affectionate with me during this time, but it's still hard. Yesterday a friend and I were staying at his place for a nearby event. He needed time to cool down after studying so he didn't really hang out with us for most of the time we were there. Admittedly I was disappointed that he wasn't friendlier with her, but when I mentioned that I wished he felt better or wanted to talk a little more I saw him start to get defensive and I quickly acknowledged I was in the wrong to bring that up at the time. I apologized a bunch, we hugged, it was fine - all told it was a 10 second weird thing.

That said, it's hard for me not to feel a little hurt when he is distant or I unaffectionate and easy to irritate.he is an incredibly fun and loving person and I know this is just how he is going to be while he's handling this stress. I know it's not permanent. I wish he handled it a bit more maturely but, I get it. So how can I reassure myself when I'm clenching my jaw to keep my patience with him? I dunno. I'm just kinda bummed out. I love him to death but I kind of feel myself pulling back (is it ok to say I feel a little annoyed?) because of this.

643,2vqven,"Hi guys.
I'm 17 &amp; about to graduate.
Backgroud: A couple years ago I was really close with a guy I did sports with, let's call him Nate. Nate and I had a ton in common and generally had fun together. We ended up having a thing. After we hooked up Nate went around badmouthing me because people were giving him crap (because people shit on him for everything). A couple months later we got together because I was an idiot, and that ended shortly thereafter.  He cared too much about what other people thought to have a public relationship, so I ended it.  I was devastated; I trusted him fully and I believed what he said because while we were together, he was so caring. When it ended, my trust was broken, and I started thinking everything he said was a lie. I lost the confidence I had before and I doubted myself. He dated another girl, why not me?

Obviously I got over it awhile ago. Frankly, Nate is an ass, and an immature teenage boy. I still care about him, but figured out that he was toxic. I was spurned again this fall when a close friend abandoned me because I irked the guy she likes (though he now has no problem with me). But I have better friends who appreciate and love me unconditionally at my best, worst, and craziest. She tried to sort of reconcile, but I rejected her, I don't need a friend like her. After getting over both betrayls, I still had deep confidence issues, though mostly I was happy. Until recently, I never believed the slew of people who told me I was pretty or interesting. I couldn't see it. I'm just me.  
At my worst, I had a depressive episode and severe anxiety leading to me taking time off, and being in an outpatient teen program for people with depression, anxiety, PTSD, or addiction. It was a great program, and I learned a lot.

Right now, I'm doing awesome. I feel happy and completely at ease. I'm about to graduate, and got into an amazing university (though still waiting to hear from my other tops).  I'm stage managing a play, whereas I'd previously done lighting, and for the first time I feel totally calm and relaxed during hell week. This week has actually been awesome, I absolutely love the people I'm working with in the cast and crew. I've been bubbly and happy during it all. Someone even commented on how nice it was that I was smiling and happy even though I must be stressed (this was when I was putting on a stress smile, so it must be a constant!) This is a major improvement. I feel confident again, almost like my old self, with a few more years and a bit more wisdom.

To the point, there's a guy I'm interested in, though I don't know him very well. He's perhaps even more into soccer than I am, he's smart, ambitious, talented, kind, and attractive. After Nate, I haven't had any real relationships. But I really like this guy and we seem to get along in short time I've known him. I want to go for it but there's only a short time left in the year. I don't really want to be rejected when I've just regained my confidence. Should I put myself out there and see what becomes of it, or just wait until college, when it's easier? I just don't want to lose my current progress. Do I risk it? 

TL;DR I had my trust seriously broken and it took two years to get back my confidence. It's such a recent occurence that I don't know if I should risk being rejected by the guy I like and losing the progress I made.","I [17/F] finally started feeling confident and happy again after being betrayed.

He's gone back to school half time this semester and is working part-time, but he has quite a bit of free time on his hands. He uses it all to play games and watch YouTube videos. Of people playing games. He's going to school for art, but doesn't make any art outside of his assignments. 

Along the same lines, he rarely gets excited about anything. Whenever I get excited about something I've done or want to do, he doesn't usually respond with any emotion and I feel stupid for feeling passionate about something. 

He's very underweight (seriously, he has a BMI of 14) and won't seek help with gaining weight or try any of the advice I've given him. He's not anorexic, but he has a physically difficult time eating because his stomach is atrophied from long gaming sessions growing up where he'd be so distracted he'd ignore his hunger (his mother was a messed up alcoholic that didn't seem to care that her kids were underweight, either--that didn't help). I know it's not my place to fix him, but it's impossible not to worry and then get aggravated that he refuses to try very hard to be healthier.

He just doesn't make me feel special. This feels like a petty reason to be upset, but it makes me sad knowing that he doesn't love me any more than he'd love virtually any girl that might happen to love him back. I know that he loves me just the way I am, and I'm lucky for that, but he doesn't love me for any particular reasons. Just the fact that I'm a girl, I love him, and I'm relatively good looking is enough for him (pretty much these words came right out of his mouth). He never seems particularly proud of me. 

In the same vein, I think he saw his ex as more special at the time. I think even now, he sort of does, but won't admit it. He talked about her alot when we first started dating, so I've developed an insecurity about her that still hasn't gone away. He still has her as a friend on Facebook, even though she's treated him horribly (they are definitely not actual friends), isn't friendly to me, and I've expressed my feelings on the subject. This also seems petty, but I can't help but take it as a sign that her feelings matter to him more than mine. 

There's one conversation we had that I can't get out of my head. I probably overreacted and was being unfair, but I still can't forgive him for something he said. I was in a bad mood on the drive home and was feeling like an inadequate person. I made an admittedly stupid comment about not going to an ivy league school (like his ex) and he got really angry and blew up at me. I tried to explain, saying I just felt insecure and sometimes wondered if he wished he could do better than me. Well, obviously I can't, was his reply (his ex broke up with him, so I think that's what he was referring to). Somehow we made up after that, but that statement has stuck with me. 


Since I'm making lists, I'll put the pros of the relationship here as well:

We understand each other when one of us is having a rough time. We (almost) always know how to comfort each other, and I love how non-judgmental he is. 

We place quite a bit of trust in one another. I'm usually quite comfortable around him, and that's not something I can say for everyone I've been with. 

He cares about his siblings quite a bit. Seeing how deeply he's capable of caring for others always makes me care more about him. 

He helps me out with little things related to my disability as well as committing simple, kind acts such as bringing me coffee in the morning. I don't rely on him to do these things, but I appreciate them and think they're sweet. 

Sorry if all of that was unnecessarily long. I'm just wondering if, considering all of these things, maybe I should try to wait it out and see if my feelings for him come back? I know we've been together awhile and all relationships have an ebb and flow when it comes to lovey-dovey emotions. We generally enjoy each other's company and he's a good friend, but maybe it's unfair to both of us for me to stay with him just for those reasons. 

Breaking up right now would also be especially hard on him, since we live together and it's the middle of the semester.

David - Dad [73M]


Zoe - Brother's LDR GF [14F]


Tom - Mine and my brother's friend [15M?]


My brother met Zoe online about a year ago in the summer on a minecraft forum. Just to provide some clarity, I moved out as soon as I turned 18, so I only really heard about Zoe and him when they started dating about a month or two later. I have no reservations or anything against this because I had an LDR of my own at the age of 17 and actually moved into my now ex's place (in another country) when I left home. I still live in the same country but we are no longer together. This is relevant because my brother looks up to me and has now taken my experience as an example for his relationship. The country that I live in is the same country that Zoe lives in and we live about 2 hours away.


My parents tried to be open about it and so on an agreement that he did well at school, he'd be allowed to go and see her for a week. They funded this trip in October around Halloween, where he met her for the first time. This fueled their relationship to continue. They continuously talked and tried to plan their next meeting, understandably. 


I'll just add here that neither I nor my parents realised that Zoe was manipulative or verbally abusive but the red flags started appearing around this time. Mainly the fact that my brother is doing his A-Levels, has private tutoring because he wants to become an aeronautical engineer and therefore requires good grades to get into Uni, as well as tennis and piano on top, which leaves very little free time. My parents did drop some classes so that he didn't have as much pressure but Zoe began to demand more time from him, basically telling him that she was more important than his education and family. If he had chores or my parents wanted to spend time with him Zoe would start arguing with him, which would then make him sad and upset and take it out on my parents. Again, although we saw a glimpse of her true colours, I only actually saw them when my brother showed me some of their conversations. Another thing worth mentioning is that around this time Jake stopped hanging out with some of his friends, one of which I also used to talk to, Tom. He said that Jake was no longer going to events and not talking to him and Tom also told my brother that he really didn't like Zoe, which is probably what caused the falling out. I didn't know (and still don't know) whether Tom spoke to Zoe or has any valid reason to dislike her beyond losing Jake as a friend.


When my parents decided they wanted to come to me for Christmas, Jake and Zoe tried to get my parents (and her parents) to arrange something. This really upset me when I heard as I work in retail and therefore wouldn't get holidays during christmas other than christmas day and boxing day off. The rest of the week I'd be working while they were here. My parents said no and that should have been the end of it. However during Christmas my brother was on his phone practically the entire time and the remainder was mainly just sulking in a corner and not really participating. I tried to talk to him to explain my side and how I felt and he understood and apologised but still maintained that he wanted to see her. At this point my parents grew massively weary (there was a lot of arguments back at home as well about how long he could spend on the computer talking to her) so they just let him go and he went on boxing day (one of my days off) to see her. My mum admitted to me really ashamed that it was a bit of relief that he wasn't there.


My brother did I think apologise again over facebook once they'd gotten back home and I admittedly ignored him. This was in January. In february I was speaking to Tom because we often play a computer game together (with my BF, my brother and other people) and he said that Jake was going to see Zoe again. Although I know I didn't answer Jake's message, it hurt that he was going to the same country and never mentioned it or asked whether there was a possibility to see me. I know it's not really fair to ask that of him at his age but it still hurt. Anyway Tom passed this on to Jake (not my intention) and so Jake again message me on facebook to apologise and we started talking again.


Fast forward about two months (March) and I'm talking to my brother about how excited I am because I am visiting them for two weeks. A proper holiday where I can enjoy my time with my family! During our conversation he mentions that Zoe tried to organise another trip for my brother to see her during the same time I was coming but he told me that he said no (this was over Easter, where they would have had holidays.) I was relieved to see he was sticking up for me but I found out later that it was actually my parents that said no. I tried to let it slide and not ruin the holiday and when I got there Jake said he'd warned Zoe he would be spending time with me and therefore less time with her. I was pleased to hear it but I guess the proof is in the pudding because when it actually came down to it, it didn't happen. He spent the entire day with her and would only hang out with me if she left to go somewhere (which is rarely). May I add that I also found out she's no longer going to school (possibly being home schooled now?) and she has anxiety issues. The one time he did hang out with me when she was available to talk was for a 45 minute game on League and she gave him absolute hell for it. This is where he showed me their convo. She was telling him she hated him, that she never loved him, threatening to cheat on him, threatening to cut herself, hell even threatening to kill herself if he said one thing wrong. And through all this he didn't blink. He admitted that they've been having arguments almost every night for one reason or another since the last time they saw each other in February. He said to me that things are better when they are in person and that he would fix things when he next saw her (which was scheduled for the week after I left and also paid by his savings). I was devastated. It made me so angry to see my brother taking abuse from some girl miles away. He would just continuously, for hours, reply that he loved her and only wanted to be with here etc etc. And she would just keep replying with one worded answers or abuse. 


On top of that we also had a conversation about sex and he admitted that in February they had sex together. This was alarm bells ringing. Where she lives the age of consent is 16. Furthermore I wouldn't put it past her if things didn't go her way to scream rape. Maybe I was wrong, maybe I wasn't, but I immediately went to my parents. They promised me they wouldn't make it obvious to my brother, which they didn't, so Jake continued to confide in me. I also want to add here that my brother told me her parents knew because they found the condom wrapper (which my brother bought by himself) and they never did anything about it. When Jake stayed over they slept in separate bedrooms but he told me that the parents often left them on their own in the day for privacy. 


Because Jake continued to disappoint me by spending time with her and not with me, he could see it hurt me. And there was a point after he'd make false promises and I told him until he could show me I wouldn't believe it, where he thought he heard me crying. He then took a glass and smashed it against the floor. I wasn't crying I'd just hurt myself (nothing major, can't even remember what it was). Anyway immediately everyone in the house heard the smash and we all went to him and sat down with him. He started crying explaining why he'd done it and how he just wanted to make everyone happy and how he hated that Zoe was giving him such a hard time for wanting to spend time with me and the family. (She'd also stopped letting him play league and other games, as well as talking to other people while he was talking to her, which was pretty 24/7. Jake also told me that she would force him to stay up with her till she wanted to sleep, which was sometimes 3/4 in the morning, where she could sleep in because she didn't have school but he would have to wake up at 7am.) Needless to say we had a family intervention and tears were shed, even by my father (where I have never ever seen him cry, in my entire life!) saying that we all hated what Zoe was doing to him. Jake would argue that they loved each other but we tried to tell him that loving someone is having respect for them and wanting to make them happy. I think he did take some of it on board and when Zoe got upset later at something extremely petty (she blocked him on facebook after an argument and then when she finally unblocked him we had dinner in 10 minutes so she got upset that he wouldn't be talking to her) he stood up to her and said some of the things we told him earlier that day. But he still couldn't follow through and establish his own authority so it didn't really help at all.


My parents spoke to a lawyer and arranged for Jake to talk to her as well so that he would understand the repercussions *IF* he had sex etc etc. and they based their decision to not let him see Zoe the following week on this. When they emailed Zoe's parents they replied basically apologising for not telling my parents and said they'd do better to supervise in the future. By this point me and my parents feel like she's just manipulating her parents as well as Jake.


This is where it all went downhill. He did admit to my parents that they'd had sex without me having to do anything so as far as I know he doesn't suspect anything and still speaks to me sometimes. But now, 2 months later, he won't speak to my parents, barely does any chores and does not have any of the ambition that he used to have. The plan was for him to go to a really good Uni in Holland (which he'd chosen) and he's saying he's not going. My parents had paid for him to go to a course in the US for aeronautical engineering and he's basically saying that if he can't go see Zoe he won't go to the course. My parents have tried to meet halfway and allow her to come visit them but her parents responded saying she wasn't comfortable flying on their own. They were looking at going on holiday as a family but have a dog that's fatally ill and therefore don't feel comfortable going. My brother has also threatened that when he moves out next year at 18, he will never speak to my parents again.

What I feel I got out of that relationship was a good understanding of exactly the type of person I'd like to get into a serious relationship with. 

Fast forward to two months ago, I meet a girl and we developed a connection right off the bat. She had mentioned fairly early on (3rd date maybe?) that she was recently out of a long-term relationship (5 years), which ended due to him moving a couple thousand miles away and her not wanting to continue that. There wasn't much discussed beyond that, however the topic was revisited after the two of us spent a weekend together. She indicated that she wasn't quite ready to jump into a serious relationship yet but really enjoyed spending time with me, so we agreed to just take things slowly and see where things land. 

After this talk, we seemed to only get closer and spent much more time with each other. After getting to know her better, I really began develop feelings for her. I haven't felt this way about anyone in a very long time, it's kind of absurd.

Rationally, I know that I should just go with the flow and that's how it has been. However, randomly I'll get anxious if I don't hear from her for a few hours or don't see her for a couple of days. I never even got this way with the girl I with for 4 years, the last time I remember being like this was in HS.

We do not live together, but at some point relatively soon we are probably going to head down that path, and this is where I see the income gap really becoming an issue.

Lately he's been trying to pay for things more than his 50% share, and this makes me extremely uncomfortable. I feel like I will probably never live up to his level of success, and like I'm not even remotely good enough for him. I've become incredibly insecure about my lack of career and crappy degree while he's off doing incredible things at just 23. I want to be able to provide an equal amount of resources and bring the same amount to the table, but I just can't, and it seriously bothers me.

He seems to be totally fine with the disparity here, but secretly it's absolutely destroying me. Do I just get over it and trust him when he says it's okay? Do I talk to him? What can I do to stop freaking out about this? I'm afraid I'm going to cause harm to our relationship over this.

317,2a2u6n,"The worst part about it is wondering what you did wrong and if you could just go back and not do it. I held all kinds of petty grudges and was such an immature piece of shit at times during our relationship.

Some stuff happened near the beginning of our relationship that I kept bringing up for years after. It hurt me but it didn't need to, it was my insecurites and my fear of her thinking I wasn't good enough for her and that she was gonna look elsewhere.

She felt so terrible about it when I brought it up, and she tried so hard to win my love back, for a long time, but I just couldn't fully give it to her because of my ego and myself. She probably cried herself to sleep so many times thinking that she could never fully win my love back. We had great memories, so freaking many of them, and a great relationship, we were like 2 peas in a pod about a lot of things. But we just never had that full 100% confidence in our relationship. Then months/years go by and she finally just rightfully gave up. Feelings went away and she left.

This is the biggest cliche ever, but god damnit do I wish I could take it all back, and if I had a redo I would do it SO DIFFERENTLY. She would have all of me this time, every word, every deep and dark secret, every feeling. Now it's me who wants to win her love back, but after all I put her through, there is no reason she should let me back in her heart with the damage I did to it.

I have learned so much from this relationship, but the only girl that I want to use that knowledge on is her.

She also gave some reasons for leaving, which are pretty legitimate. She had a boyfriend before me from age 15-18 1/2, and then we started dating around her 19th birthday, she's now 22 and me 25.

She said she probably wasn't fully recovered from her past relationship, and she is probably right about that.

She needs some time to actually just be her, build up some confidence and self esteem and be her own person. She has never really been that as an adult and it probably will be healthy for her to get into that. I am proud of her for making that move too, and it's something that would've probably arisen no matter what I did right or wrong in our relationship, so because I can't change it, it's kind of comforting.

I have read this section plenty of times and I know that somehow a third party always enters the picture, however I can promise you that neither of us are really the type to do that, and I sincerely believe her that the last thing she wants right now is any type of intimate relationship with any man. She needs to find herself within herself and she really does mean it, I don't doubt it.

She said some things like If it's meant to be maybe we will get back together sometime or  6 months from now I'll be home for good but 6 months is a very long time, and maybe she is right, but I can't really just wait for it unfortunately. I think eventually the feelings will pass, but I don't want them to.

I don't think either of us wanted it to come to this, we talked about marriage and kids and a life together all of the time. We talked about when we're married and all that.

The worst part about all of this is that I said that she was my best friend and I fucking meant it. I still want to text her and talk to her, I don't care about sex or even having her be my girlfriend if she doesn't want to, but I want to be friends... yet I know that it's probably not a good idea at least for awhile.

I regret all the times I didn't pick up my phone immediately and text her back, I just took her for granted and 5 minutes later I would forget to respond until about 2 hours later or sometimes longer. You know how girls are, she probably was like WTF for 2 hours straight.

I think I would've rather had this gone down in flames, but instead she turned back to talk to me twice before she drove off for the last time. I can't forget that last hug we gave and the way she fits right into my arms when we hug. I will really miss that feeling.

**TL;DR Our relationship was both amazing and fulfilling, yet there was always an aura of insecurity for both of us. I held some grudges and did some things that, instead of calling me out on, she would think about quietly. They became unresolved issues that most likely led to a lot of confidence and self esteem problems for her, possibly attributing to her reasoning that she needs to gain some personal strength and be her own person, which is one of the reasons we broke up.**","My [25M] girlfriend [22F] just broke up with me after 3 years, and I am full of regret, shock, and disappointment",0,False,3,3,1404763871,/r/relationships/comments/2a2u6n/my_25m_girlfriend_22f_just_broke_up_with_me_after/,Romantic

I'll try to keep it short.

My gf is Chinese and we both are very serious with each other. I've already fought my parents a lot despite their conviction that it's 'too difficult' to have such relationship and also she has fought her parents a lot as they also believe it's too difficult due to the long distance between us. She has fought them very much, lots of tears have fallen etc., and despite they don't like her to be with me, she has kept fighting with them and has stayed with me, which makes me very happy off course and which makes me believe she really loves me.

Now, in the first year we were together, we had some rough moments, mainly being my fault as I was immature and kept making arguments for no reason, and after one year we broke up for three months. During this period she went out three times to a club with some boys and she went maybe twenty times to a bar drinking, having fun and some flirting with boys etc., but no actual sex was involved, and I 100% believe her, as I know she won't lie for such thing. During this period I was back home and I was thinking a lot about my past actions and did a lot of reflecting and I can truly say I changed during that period to be a better man (I always made arguments for no reason during the first year of our relationship)

Since two years ago, I'm doing my best to be a perfect bf for her, I'm 100% loyal to her despite our long distance and separation, I'm devoted to our future and I would do anything for her. I've told her many times she can ask me anything, and I feel happy to make her happy.

We've been now four months separated since her last visit and as she's a student in China, she will be visiting me during her holiday in January-February for the fourth time with a tourist visa.

Now the real problem: Since we had broken up two years ago, she has given a 'yoga lesson' in a flirty way to some western boy she flirted over the cam and I made her promise to also give me similar treatment ^^. It was the boy who asked her for it and the second time he asked she gave him a 'yoga lesson', knowing he only asks so he can check out her body. Now it's been already two years further and despite I've made her very clear I would really like her to do this once to me (I've asked/begged her 30 times, I started several big fights over this, and last half year I never mentioned it again to her giving her the chance to spontaniously do it once), she still never flirted me this way and I have a general feeling that **she does not care about me**. Every time I ask her, she will tell me she'll do it later, and next month or something like that. I really TOTALLY don't understand this, as it's so easy for her to do it and make me happy, why she doesn't just make me happy? Isn't that the basis of any relationship!? .. want to make each other happy. Her promise to give me a 'yoga lesson' is not the only issue we have, as she has also promised me eight times she'll be my Chinese teacher teaching me every day for one hour, and last time her excuse was that she was too busy with school and will teach me when she's here with me, despite she often has time to go window shopping with her friends a whole day long, and other days she has time to relax watching movies or surfing the internet whole evening. When I tell this to her, she tells me she also needs time to relax.

**I know this sounds ridiculous, making a fight for a stupid 'yoga lesson'**, but I reallllllly can't understand her. And they say it are little things in relationship which can give you the feeling someone loves you, and I can't feel this from her. In general I have a feeling she doesn't care for me, and I told her this, and I want her to be honest to me and keep her promises she makes.

I've send her an email telling her I want to know why she doesn't just 'do it' to wanna make me happy, but after we had a big fight she hasn't contacted me for two days now. Yesterday I've send her a little message that I know she loves me even she doesn't say it. I don't know what to do :(

I keep wondering if she really loves me, and I totally don’t understand it as she fights her parents so much to be with me. At the same time I don’t have the feeling she wants to make me happy. What is in her mind?????

Before you ask: Yes, I'm 100% sure she fights her parents a lot, she has forced them to meet me several times, and I know she has already suffered a lot fighting her parents for me.

458,2ulq23,"This is constantly eating away at me, so
I could really use some advice.

Some backstory:

My husband and I have been together for about 9 years, married for 7. We have two children together, and are expecting our third. We have a ridiculously close relationship, and I often tell him (as cheesy as it sounds) that the first time we met, I felt like my soul found its match.

This female friend of his (I'll call her Cassie) he has known her since she was a little kid. He is friends with her brother, and has been since he was about 15, making Cassie 6. I've known her for quite a few years now. She's young, naive, giddy, silly, etc. she adapts to her social settings, and can fit in with any type of person. For a couple of years, my husband and I were really into filming MMA type shows locally, and Cassie's brother actually ran a promotion that we filmed for the most. I took my son there when he was little, because even though it was a fighting type environment, it was really family oriented. A few years ago, the promotion went under and that was the last time we saw Cassie.

However, a year and a half ago, my husband was approached about filming out of state. Cassie has a bunch of friends where this location is, and asked to tag along to a few shows. No big deal. My husband went on to say how annoying she was, and was constantly making up stories and wouldn't constantly tell everyone in the car things about her friends that were most likely secrets. Again, she's very immature.

I started to get really uncomfortable about their relationship, because now Cassie was going to every single show my husband was going to, and helping him film. It started out as being upset because that was OUR thing, but having two small children makes it difficult to commit to things like that, and he really needed the help. She started taking pictures with him and uploading them on Instagram... Something I find a bit inappropriate. I told him I didn't like it, but he basically said he can't control who uploads things. 

We started constantly arguing about it. I asked him on multiple occasions to stop inviting her along, but the response was how he hates awkward situations and that there is no reason whatsoever to feel insecure about her. Here we are today, a year and a half after they started filming together... And I'm still feeling like he would rather piss me off and jeopardize our marriage then tell her to stop coming along. She asked him to film her sisters wedding in May of this year, and he was really hesitant because he knows I don't want him to. She got upset with him for not accepting a deposit, and when I probed him on why, he said it's supposed to be her present to her sister and wants to make sure it's taken care of... Which I find hard to believe. After he got back from this last filming trip, I told him that I'm no longer going to put my feelings aside for this, and that if he wants to stay married to me, his best friend, then he is no longer filming anything with or for her.

The next day, i actually started to feel guilty that I have him an ultimatum, since I find those to be extremely childish at times. It just makes me feel things about myself that I don't like. I shouldn't have to constantly deal with something that makes me feel uncomfortable.

So please, am I overreacting? Should I just get over it?

Edit:

I really wanted to add something.  This isn't an easy situation for me at all.  This took a really huge tole on our relationship last year, and I couldn't figure out if I was overreacting because I'm just insecure, or because I have a reason to feel insecure.  We almost separated over this, and it put me into one of the biggest bouts of depression I've ever gone through.  We were able to work it out, and I ended up trying to change my feelings instead of asking him to change his.  Re-reading this post, I feel like it sounds completely innocent.  I just keep getting these feelings that I can't ignore anymore.

I met my now gf (22F, lets call her Marie) and she comes from a strict religious family. in the beginning of our relationship, she mentioned sex was not an option. This was fine and we continued our relationship.  She started her final year of school and we ended up doing the deed. She is very into it and we do it every time we see each other.

Now going back to my first relationship with Beccy, we have always told each other what we are doing or about to do or go to. (Shopping, watch a movie, go to dinner with a friend, etc). Being that this is my second relationship, being with Marie, I guess I got used to being included in activities so to speak.

When we first started going out (Marie and I) we communicated what we were doing frequently.

**Is it normal for couples to do that? Even without asking what the other is doing? I don't know. I am seeing what other's experiences are.**

Now she's been back at school and she doesn't tell me that she goes out, going to dinner, bar, etc. She actually went to a bar one day with a female friend of hers and told me right before they had left for it.

This surprised me and annoyed a bit because she doesn't usually go to bars. It was just out of the blue.

Now lately, she goes on for hours without talking to me, or telling me anything that she does.

We were texting throughout the day a little and she mentioned her day was bad. I had asked her what was wrong and she said she would tell me after work.  I asked again an hour after her work and 20 mins later, she tells me to hold on.

Ok fine, she's probably busy doing who knows what. 2 hours roll by and she responds with an apology and explained that she went to dinner with a female friend that I met earlier this week.  

**What would any of you do in this situation? tell your SO you're going to dinner? Or just blow off their text?**

I am just looking for other views on this. Every time she does this, it just hurts my trust a little. 

Am I wrong to be a little mad at her? I appreciate any advice, harsh or not.  This being my second relationship, I actually don't know how to handle this.

I've been in relationships that lasted much longer, and I feel as though I have a pretty fair spectrum from which to view this heartbreak.


Up until the break-up, I had been a touch shy on occasion, but nothing to the point of social anxiety or any debilitating condition. No one cheated, neither I nor her were bitter about the break-up. We split because of long-distance and the split happened without much fighting. 


We met while I was studying abroad and it seemed destined to be one of *those* relationships, where you grow close just out of fear of being alone in a foreign country. I think I would have been fine with that, but at some point I realized this was and is the only girl I've ever been in love with. Probably on our second or third vacation together.


I'm usually the guy who's funny to be around and doesn't let even his closest friends in on what's happening in his personal life. After I returned, we were still very much together and I wasn't just saying embarrassingly cutesy things about her; I was completely without a filter between my public and private life.


To summarize my life now, it's gotten to the point where I cannot hide from the truth. I have become Hal Incandenza, the student who moves without feeling. Every single conversation is just a practice in avoidance, elaborately articulated topics designed to look like real conversation. Interesting enough to maintain friendships but absolutely nothing personal about them deep down at all. 


The saddest part of all of this? I'm living my dream. Since I was eleven, I have dreamed of being a screenwriter. Now I'm at one of the best film schools in the country, which happens to be half an hour from where she lives. And I'm drifting through life emotionless, right now, when it's as fantasy-like as it will ever be. Sometimes an entire week will pass where I function as a normal student and I couldn't tell you a single thing that happened on the next Monday.


Last year I taught English in Asia. She visited me for a week, which didn't seem weird because we had remained close for about a year before that. She was living and continues to live with her boyfriend.


I've been in and out of relationships, worst of all telling many of those girls that I loved them. I can't bring myself to extricate her from my life because I never had that 'fuck you' fallout. As far as I can see, she isn't poisonous or toxic in any way. In fact I would feel fucking ridiculous asking something like that, because I don't perceive myself to be an influence on her life or day-to-day thoughts in any way. (I view this as a very good thing.) It's just me, saying over and over that it's time to move on, and never doing it. I have motivation to take on difficult tasks; it's not for want of trying. I'm a graduate student. How did my life get to this point?

She tried to hang herself but the belt (it was a cloth belt) broke. When i found her she was huddled on the floor in the spot she fell. She was crying and i thought at first that something else happened.

I thought she got sicker or something went wrong with her. But she just got up and walked to her bed and went under the cover. She didnt talk to me again that day. The next morning she told me what happened. She tried to kill herself and failed. She decided this a few weeks ago. That it would be better if she died now. She thinks that my life would be eaiser without her. She thinks that she is ruining my life because we are poor and she is sick.  

I unofficially adopted my sister when I turned 18. We grew up in a hard house and i couldnt let her stay there when i left for college. So i took her with me. Then she got sick. So i worked more and did what i had to so that she could live a little longer. I would up being dismissed from college b/c i couldnt keep my grades up. 

She blames herself for this. She blames herself for everything. She got better two years ago but im still paying off the bills from her treatment. So i can't afford much. I can't give her much. 

she thinks she is sick again. Based on what has been happening to her body i think she is right. She has been hiding it from me but i should have noticed. She has been getting worse for the last few months. But she didnt tell me. She didnt tell anyone. Because she thinks we cant afford for her to he sick again. 

So she deicded that it woild he best for her to take her life instead. She thinks it is better if she dies now rather than to go through treatment again because she knows we can't afford it.

109,2s1ho6,"Hi, my boyfriend and I broke up in the beginning of December because of a cheating thing kind of, he said he wanted nothing to do with me but I really wanted to stay together so I begged him and offered for him to be able to look through my phone and everything whenever he wants to and that I'd be open about everything from now on. He agreed to get back together with me. It's now been about a month and he still goes through it sometimes. I changed my phone password last week to see if he'd actually ask or he didn't care anymore, but last time we hung out he did ask why I changed it, I said I thought he didn't need to know it anymore but I did give it to him again so he knows it now. 

I don't want to have to share everything with him, especially after a month of having to prove myself to him, I don't understand why he's being like this, he pretty much has trust issues or something. Whenever I even hang out with other guys he'll ask what we're doing and stuff and we have been dating for nearly 8 months and after all that time together he doesn't even trust me.. Why do you think he's like that and is there any way you think I could get him to trust me? Or we could find some sort of middle ground, I don't know?

666,2tyr4c,"I have been invited to come along with my boyfriend and his family (and some other siblings and family friends/relations) on a vacation this summer.  Both my boyfriend and I will be paying our pro rata share for the rental.  The rental does not belong to the family, but is rented at a slight discount through a family friend or coworker.

The room we will be sharing has two twin beds.  I have asked that we push the beds together so that we can spend time together at night.  His family (who honestly, I really love - they are wonderful people) is rather traditional, and so Boyfriend is not comfortable with this.  He knows that pushing the beds together will make it very clear that we are spending time together, and he is afraid of a confrontation with his family.

His argument is that his parents are the elders, and we will be their guests, and so we should respect their values while we are on vacation.

My argument is that there should be a sense of mutual respect, and absolutely there can be boundaries in common areas, but that mutual respect goes both ways and that what happens behind that closed door is between us and us alone.

To my credit, I have agreed to abstain from sex during the week (I can appreciate concerns regarding noise and embarrassment), but can't see spending a week with my boyfriend without being able to cuddle and sleep together.  

To Boyfriend's credit, he recognizes that this matters a lot to me and he is kind of stuck between a rock and a hard place here, and I know he is stressed because he can't make everyone happy.  

I hate that I am causing him this stress, but I also have concerns moving forward regarding his willingness to allow his family into the decision-making process regarding our private relationship and intimacy - I feel that those are boundaries that are inviolable, and should involve only me and him.  I could maybe understand better if we were in high school or even college, but we're 30 years old, in the middle of our careers at this point.  It feels very weird to have someone setting those kinds of rules for thirty-year-olds.

Boyfriend doesn't want his family to know we are having sex.  Of course, the fact that we are intimate doesn't need to be something to flaunt or discuss in the open at the dinner table, but I kind of feel like, really?!  This is something very normal for two adults in a committed relationship to be doing.  I can appreciate generational differences in values, but I really feel bad that he wants to sort of live this double life, instead of acknowledging our choice, if for some reason a family member feels they are entitled to make a comment on it.  We aren't doing anything wrong.

Am I right to believe that we are entitled to relationship boundaries that shouldn't be crossed by his parents, or am I wrong for expecting quiet-time/cuddle-time with my boyfriend behind closed doors if family is around?

**tl;dr**: Boyfriend and I are debating joining his tight-knit, traditional family for a vacation this year.  We are arguing over family and relationship boundaries - he believes that his parents should have the right to tell us we can abstain from private intimacy (even cuddling) during the vacation, and I don't believe they should be able to tell us what we can do in private behind a closed door.  I've agreed to abstain from sex but would like to push the two twin beds together in the room so that I can cuddle with him at night.  I don't know if I'm being unreasonable with my expectations, or if Boyfriend should be more willing to take a stand, should someone say something when we come out of the bedroom in the morning.","Me [30 F] with my boyfriend [29 M] of three months, having an argument over intimate time during summer vacation with his family.",0,False,54,173,1422455659,/r/relationships/comments/2tyr4c/me_30_f_with_my_boyfriend_29_m_of_three_months/,Romantic
375,2z5ivr,"I've known my ex-girlfriend since Winter 2011. We originally started out as friends for about a year until she considered me her best friend. I didn't think much of her back then so I thought it was a kind gesture. Back then, I was just helping her with school and that was sincerely because I just liked helping her. In the years to follow, her and I have had a series of on and off relationships. I was basically always chasing her while she just never had feelings for me. 

The relationship has always seemed more superficial on her part. I've spent thousands on her. I am talking about breast augmentation, clothes, accessories and rent (just once). I'll admit the sex was nice, but I was doing all those things in hopes that she would see how hard I was trying to make her happy and change for me. In the midst of all this though, she still had feelings for her ex-boyfriend that she cheated on last summer. 

Last summer, she cheated on her ex-boyfriend because I was moving on to other opportunities and she was scared of losing me as a friend. In her own words, she was scared of losing me so she thought the best way to keep me in the picture is by sleeping with me. After she cheated on him, she was very confused about who she wanted to be with and tried to get the best of both worlds while she could. I was buying her stuff while she continued to resolve her relationship with her ex. It was during this time that I helped pay for her breast augmentation. The initial agreement was that if I helped her pay, she would offer me unlimited sex. I know now that this looked very bad on both of us but we agreed not too soon after that she would pay her share when she finds the money to pay it back.

In addition to the surgery and other things I was buying her, I was still helping her out with school more than I ever had. I already graduated last year but I was still doing things like writing papers for her, doing her assignments, and even going to class with her to help her take notes. I was doing this for a while until she told me that she was sleeping with two other guys on my birthday. After she told me, she promised me that she would cut contact off from them but I found out that was a lie in couple of weeks. I found out she slept over at one of the other guy's place and was hurt by all this. Her behavior towards me was already making me unhappy so I did what I thought was best. 

During the period that I was taking care of her, she was still contacting her ex because she still had feelings for him. She planned on getting back with him someday by confessing everything that she had done to him. I couldn't trust her to do this because she told me that she planned on telling him the day before they got married if she wasn't going to tell him sooner than that. I couldn't trust her and I didn't want her to continue hurting others. She already cheated on him. She cheated on me which by the way was encouraged by her ex-boyfriend. He actually told her that she should see more people outside of me which I thought was very messed up. I was also unhappy with the way she was treating me in the relationship so I didn't want to see anyone else, including her ex, get hurt. I decided that I was going to write an e-mail to her ex and address everything that has happened since she cheated on him. 

I didn't anticipate the consequences of what would happen if she found out I wrote those emails but what I did know was that her ex was most likely not going to take her back. When her ex told her that I was the one who wrote them, she became suicidal because all she wanted to do was win her ex back and be with him. I ruined that for her and as a result, has sent her into severe depression. Her family read the emails and is also aware of the situation. Her parents aren't proud of what she did and questioned why she would do something like that to me and her ex. 

In the midst of her depression, I decided to sue her because she promised she would pay me back for the surgery but provided no clear method of how she was going to pay it back. I gave her a chance to mediate but she didnt want to talk to me. In her defense, she told me she didn't want to talk because she was still in shock from the emails I sent to her ex. 

The lawsuit has been resolved but her family wants me to cooperate in her recovery. I don't think this is a good idea because I was the problem to begin with. Her mother insists that she's stable enough to talk to me but from what I've experienced first-hand, she is not. One day she's able to talk to me calmly and the next she's angry at me for ruining her chance to get back with her ex-boyfriend. She has expressed that she still wants to remain friends and I really don't know why she wants to. I've asked her myself and she still hasn't given me a clear answer other than the fact that I have done so much for her and she wants to return the favor somehow. She told me that if she wants me to help her, she wants to see me rise above all this by going to therapy and going to church to reinforce my morals and principles. I was really offended by this because I wasn't the one who cheated on 4 different guys. Something else that I thought was ridiculous was that she talked to the guys she cheated with and they both thought that they're no better than her (which is correct if you consider that they screwed me over) and that it was ridiculous of me to ask her for the money she owed me.

After all that has happened, I somehow still find myself having feelings for her. I've already told her how I felt and that I don't really care what she thinks about I have to say yet I respect her decision to do what she has to do. She has expressed that she wants to remove every part of her body that has to do with me. This includes a tattoo, the implants, and the her hair (not all of it, just the parts that I have touched). If she moves on, even better. Good riddance.

I tried clearing things up a few times, stopped talking to her for a few weeks but eventually came back to her. She did the same, we needed each other.

Last year, I figured this relationship was too toxic. It distracted me, gave me false hopes, and didn't lead to anything. It was the right decision, for me, to stop talking to her. She always felt like she didn't care about anything. If I stopped talking to her, then fine, she would move on.

1159,1trbv9," I have recently broke with my boyfriend of 9 months due to substance issues on his part. He is not a bad person, always very caring and loving, but I feel I need to be able to trust who I am in a relationship with, and I am unable to do that at this time. However, my issue involves something that occurred months before the break up. 

In the middle of my relationship, a newly single friend of mine (20 M) whom I've know since freshman year (2.5 years) suddenly asked me out without knowing about my current relationship. I was shocked, as he had been in a relationship the entirety of our friendship, and I never expected to hear this from him. We have always gotten along, hanging out was a blast, and I do admit that I have had feelings for him which I ignored since he was dating somebody else, obviously. So I politely declined his offer, after all I was in love now right? And we still remained friends, running into each other from time to time.

By the time I had been starting to reach points of turbulence with my now ex, I found out that my friend had started dating somebody else. For reasons unknown, a part of me was crushed. How can he be taken already? and, was I really expecting him to remain single forever? But more importantly, why did I care so much?

Meanwhile, my own happiness was deteriorating and I was forced to make a decision- Would I rather be unhappy in a relationship than be alone? Our relationship finally reached a breaking point and I called it off. My ex has made recent attempts to go to great lengths to make amends and fix our broken relationship. I know he still loves me, I never doubted it, but I still remain unsure about the whole thing.

 Nowadays, I feel I have missed a window of opportunity; a potential fun relationship with a great friend. But I am also sad that my last relationship with a great guy ended for reasons I could not control. And if I'm still thinking about my old friend, does this mean I never really loved my ex? At least I thought I did, after all. Or is this a case of the grass always being greener? I am in search for advice/personal experience etc. for getting over and moving on from a situation like this. I can't seem to get past my regrets. I do realize I am 20 after all and surrounded by single college students 24/7, but it's still nice to hear reassurance from people with more experience, rather than making assumptions on my own. Thanks!!

She came out of school with no student loans whatsoever and I will be paying them for a good chunk of my life. However, just because she comes from a wealthy family doesn't mean she doesn't work hard. She currently is working 2 jobs and 2 internships to help  get her dream job at Google. 

So her birthday is coming up in March and she talked about how fun it would be to go to Vegas with me and her friends who also are a couple. I thought she was just talking hypothetically and I said that would be pretty fun and then she just started listing out what she would do. I told her my funds were tight, but maybe we can work something out. Keep in mind that we had already gone once already last year with another group of friends.

A week or so later, she texts me saying that she talked to her friends and that they were down and Vegas was officially happening.She sounded so excited but I couldn't help feeling like crap because I know that I couldn't afford something like that. I told her how I felt and she said that she knew that and she would spot me for any expenses because she wanted me to come and this trip to happen. I said I didn't want her doing that because I would feel bad and I should be paying for her. She asked what I wanted to do then and I just told her that she can go without me with her friends. She told me that she didn't want to be a 3rd wheel on her birthday and that she'll just cancel it until furthur notice. I told her that she didn't need to do that and she assured me that it's fine because she was just acting selfish in the moment.

Just yesterday, I asked her what her new plans were now and she says she's probably not going to do anything for her birthday.

As we've been dating, I notice Derek gets low-key upset when I talk about my friends that are guys. I also like to keep exes as friends, and when I even so much as mention the name of an ex, he gets really moody and stubborn.

Derek and I both have problems with depression, so I understand his insecurity, but sometimes I feel like he uses it to punish me for talking to/about another boy. I try my best to assure him that I have romantic feelings for him and only him, but he convinces himself that I like whatever boy I'm mentioning and that he isn't good enough for me.

I can't even talk to boys that we are both friends with. For example, we have a mutual friend. Let's call him James. Derek and I will be talking about James, who is particularly short. I'll poke fun and mention how short he is, and Derek will say something like Oh well James is an attractive dude. And then I'll say something like I know, he's just so tiny!

Then it's like I just said his mom died. He'll be all, Oh, so you think James is cute? And it's over. I can't say anything to convince him otherwise. 

The other thing is that he HATES thinking about me being at parties. I like to smoke, it's fun, and I get very sociable. Derek will tell me how flirty I get when I'm high, despite all of the people I hang out with telling me I just get talkative and friendly. (The was one time a guy friend of mine fell, and I accidentally said Babe, are you okay? Derek was LIVID. All low-key, of course. Hasn't let it go since.)

The difficult thing is that Derek KNOWS he has a problem. He just doesn't know how to fix it. He says he hates that he's possessive, but still makes me feel extremely guilty for even thinking about being friends with a guy.

I can't even have 'celebrity crushes.' I once told him about my infatuation with a musical artist, and ever since he won't even listen to his music, and gets upset when I mention him.

In middle school he had a serious girlfriend who he dated for 3(?) years. At some point she admitted to him that she liked someone else. They broke up. Whatever. It was middle school.

I feel like this affects our relationship, though. Which is kind of ridiculous. I'm an extreme faithful person, but I feel like he doesn't trust me at all. He says he does, but I don't buy it.

Other than the possessiveness, he's an amazing boyfriend. He knows how to help me cope with my depression, he makes me feel beautiful, wanted, and loved. He's never been any form of abusive to me. We have an excellent sex life (2-5 times a day whenever we hang out, and he always focuses on making me feel good.) 

He doesn't have a car and he lives 20 minutes away from me (by car), yet he rides his skate board all the way to my job near my house just to buy ice cream and talk to me. Whenever he has extra money, he takes me out to dinner. All of my friends are jealous of how great he is.

Normally, I could deal. I'm a very empathetic person, so I understand his insecurity. But in about 7 months I'm going to be going off to college 3 hours away. He's in a grade below me, so we'll be in an LDR for his senior year and my freshman year in college.

I've been in a LDR before, and I don't find them that hard. Keeping contact is easy, and I'll come visit my hometown for family all the time. Its also especially nice when we have a date set for the end of the long distance.

The problem is that I feel like he won't trust me at all by myself. I don't want him to beat himself up saying that I'm going to find someone in college. I have real, legitimate feelings for him, and I find no interest in anyone else.

What should I do? I don't want to break up with him, at all, he's the only person who's ever been this tolerant of my depression and my abrasive personality, and I can honestly say I think I'm in love with him. I just want him to trust me.

Additionally, I'm bisexual, I've been with girls, but he's never pulled this with a girl before. Just guys.

860,206ac0,"I posted a week ago about an ex that dumped me but had started texting/calling and telling me that she fucked things up and wanted to see me again. We are both older - 46 here, she is 37. I have been married twice; her never.

I decided to meet with her - we went to an awesome private music venue in the middle of nowhere - part of the folk alliance, so there is always incredible line-up. About 100 in attendance, the day was beautiful, the people were so nice, the grounds were gorgeous - it was really a red-letter day. My plan was to enjoy the music, and I was going to tell her on the drive back home (about a 2 hour drive) that I didn't think I could put myself in a position to be hurt again by her.

We had never really talked about her reasons for backing off so heavily, so I started by re-opening the old wound to get an explanation. What I got is that she had been engaged twice in her past. Her first fiancée died from cancer. Her second fiancée left her with no explanation a week before the wedding. A third serious relationship ended badly - after she called things off, the guy stalked her, beat her up, and raped her (resulting in an abortion).

She told me that she had an unbreakable shell around her heart, and that I broke a hole in it, which scared her and caused her to panic. So rather than deal with those emotions, she decided it was better/easier to retreat. She also said the month we were apart was miserable and painful.

In addition to that, she said she wanted to be married, and wanted a child, and assumed I wasn't interested in any of that. In addition, she was also scared because I am significantly older and, in addition, I am a paraplegic. So there are a bunch of confounding factors about our situation. I am actually interested in being married again, and would love to have a child, as improbable as that seems.

SO - the end result - we both had such an awesome time together that we are working on overcoming the obstacles in our way. She confessed her deep love for me, and how the only picture in her mind of us is married with a child and how happy that makes her. I tried to deny my feelings for her, but they flooded back in immediately when I first saw her yesterday. Today has been really great - I just smile like a fool when I think about her. She told me how good she felt about things and his happy she was today.

It wasn't particularly heated, no verbal abuse and only slightly raised voices. But out of nowhere as we stood in the kitchen, she cocked her right hand back and slapped me clean across the mouth. I said nothing particularly provoking and the fight ended then and there, mainly because I was stunned into silence. She immediately burst into tears and apologized, we moved past it.

This was about a month ago but it's been playing on my mind ever since. She has a temper, I'm a very calm individual, but she never engages in physical violence, except here she did.

I made the mistake thinking she wanted to try and start things up again.


Anyways, I found out a few days ago that she started hooking up with a new guy.  I had suspicions (she posted some stuff about going out, etc) and so I asked her saying I just want to make sure we're on the same page because we've always been exclusive when we hooked up in the past.  


She told me that honestly she did hook up with the guy.  I just feel so disposable again, as we were fine and I was actually hanging out with her when she met the guy.

I just don't understand why she is suddenly making these plans that completely crush anything we had talked about doing together this summer. I tell her that I want to take her to a concert this summer and I buy the tickets, and then she decides that her and some friends are going to go to Nashville for a week, missing the day of the concert.

205,34eslh,"Okay so my boyfriend and I have been together almost a year. We live together; I know it's relatively soon to be doing so but financially it was our best option (we used to live about an hour away from one another). I should probably mention that we met on Tinder and that he admitted he had slept with almost 50 girls from it before meeting me. ALSO should probably mention that we are both recovering alcoholics. I have almost 4 years of sobriety and he has about 2.5.

Promising start, no? Anyway this guy is incredible. I love him more deeply than I have ever loved anyone and feel that I have truly found someone who complements me but also inspires me to be a better woman. We obviously have our moments but all in all we have a great time together and I have always felt very secure in our relationship until recently. 

He has just been distant. Quick to anger and quick to flip. We have always been forthcoming about members of the opposite sex reaching out to us and what they say. Probably stemming from insecurity and jealousy, we are definitely the type to say who is it? When the others phone goes off. It's never been an issue until recently I can tell he has been irritated by it and it planted the seed of doubt in my head. He has a computer in our room that is password protected and I've never needed to use it but the other day i was sitting at it and was going to look something up and asked him for the password and he refused to give it to me. Like I said that is not our style. We know eachothers passwords for phones, iPads, etc. Just from using them; i had never really snooped before this. Him refusing to give me the password was a red flag to me even though he tried to play it off by guilting me for not respecting his privacy and his things, etc. Through some observation I got his password and when he went to a work meeting yesterday I went in. I didnt find much at first, just web history of him looking at other girls facebooks which is fairly innocuous. I felt dumb but kept going. He had sent some girls messages on Twitter which is definitely out of character but they were not sexual or overtly flirty so again I felt dumb. I decided to check his facebook and that's where I found overtly sexual and flirty messages to other girls. Multiple girls and statements like you are so gorgeous and let's have a secret affair. Asking another girl for a boob pic, tell another girl she has a fuck me profile picture and asking if that means he gets to fuck her now. Etc. This was only since monday. Presumably there were more that were deleted. 

I freaked out and had a panic attack. Didn't know what to do. My brain said move his shit outside and lock the doors and never speak to him again. I feel betrayed and hurt and deeply insecure. I am also in recovery from an eating disorder and still struggle with issues of self worth and not being good enough. i also know from my history that my first reaction may be extreme or misplaced so I called my sponsor. She encouraged me to not make a rash decision, talk to him, and to remember that in longer relationships, everyone fucks up somehow eventually. I am not sure how much he must have paid her to say all this.

Kidding; but I did heed her advice. I called him and we talked briefly over the phone. I acknowledged that if I was feeling doubts or feeling suspicious, I should have had a conversation with him instead of going through his things behind his back. That being said, i presumed he would not have told me the truth had i attempted said conversation and he confirmed that he would not have, basically. I told him everything I found and i cried and yelled and told him not to come home. 

Now I was already in the full blown crazy state and had snooped to the max, so I went back on his computer. He has iMessage linked. He had one conversation with a friend where he told him what happened and acknowledged it was shitty and that appeared to feel bad. Another conversation he basically laughed it off, told a different friend he'd be fine and that he would just get a studio apartment, said he was kicked out for the night and was going to pork some shrimp.

Now at this point im ready to murder him but im also terrified he is going to have sex with someone else if he Stays elsewhere. I ask him to come home so we can talk, and he agrees. I do tell him about reading the texts on his computer in addition to the earlier snooping. He claims he knew I was but I highly doubt that.

He is very sad, groveling. Apologizes and says all the right things about it having nothing to do with me, etc. Says he has been struggling since moving in with me and having to reestablish a sober support system in this area. Feeling miserable and not doing anything about it except acting out in this compulsion. Now I know it sounds like excuses but as an alcoholic myself I know there is validity to what he is saying. He is also just starting work and has been off work for 6 weeks so it is all exacerbated by his lack of productivity and excess of idle time. That is my assessment, not his. He promised to delete social media (which he did), give me passwords to phone, computer, email, etc. He said it never went any farther than flirting and it will never happen again. He says he needs to start going to more meetings and get a new sponsor out here. He said he was somewhat relieved because he has felt so shitty and like he had this secret but now he feels like he can actually look me in the eyes again.

My questions are endless but I will try to keep them concise (not my strong point). Am I making the wrong decision? Is he completely full of shit? Is it possible that it won't happen again?

My biggest concern is that if we want this to work I have to be willing to move on and let it go. It won't serve either of us for me to be resentful and punishing him. For anyone who has been in a similar position, is it possible? I worry I am not emotionally capable. I worry it will consume me.

I've been with my girlfriend for about 5 years now. Before you ask, we are planning to get married but not until we both can financially support it...we live paycheck to paycheck now. 

Earlier this week, she started talking about how she was talking to an old friend from high school because his dad is now one of her professors. She made it a point to mention that nothing was going on between them. She got defensive when I causally asked what they were chatting about and that I needed to drop it. She is always telling me about conversations she has even if she knows it won't interest me. 

Red flag #1...

Recently (the past few days), I've noticed her behavior drastically change. She's more protective of her phone and is always on it when before, she'd go almost a whole day without even checking it. She's more concerned with my work schedule and is very curious on when I'll be home each night. And now, she has a non-existent sex drive.  

Red flag #2...

This brings is to today...

She got home from work about 6:15 today which is completely normal. We watched tv for a little whole and around 6:45, I wanted to go grab some dinner so I can take a nap later. All of a sudden, after she was done on her phone, she wanted sex. I'm all for sex but I need my nap in order to be functioning for my night shift so I declined. Immediately she accused me of not finding her attractive and that I didn't love her any more.

Hogwash.

As usual, I tried to reassure her that I do love her and find her attractive but explained I was tired and just wanted to get to bed. 

Dinner went okay. She had an alcoholic drink and things seemed to have gotten better. She told me that my food (a chicken dish) was making her feel sick and she's been feeling like this for 2 days. Last time she felt like this, she learned she was pregnant with her son (not mine by the way.) We went to walgreens, picked up a pregnancy kit, and talked about it on the way home. 

Everything out of her mouth was pro-baby. I tried to explain that I'm all for bringing a child into our lives, but only if it's financially feasible. Cut the tirade of You always are concerned with our finances. Yes honey, I'm so sorry for wanting to make sure we have a place to live and meals to eat. I told her the only way we could do it is if we moved back home with our respective parents during the pregnancy to save money. NOPE. Bad subject to bring up. She told me if she's pregnant, she's keeping it despite what my opinion is, and if I don't like it, she'll just leave me. We got home and she stormed off to the bathroom to take the test. It was negative by the way.

I woke up early from my nap this evening (I work 3rd shift) and found that she was in the bathroom with the door locked. (She has never locked the bathroom door in the entire time I've known her.) I knocked on the door and asked if she was okay. She opened the door and said that she was just getting ready to surprise me. (She has never woken me up during my nap before.)

Final red flag...

At first I was ashamed about what I was about to do, but after recalling all f the previous events, I had to find out what she changed into a different person. I grabbed the iPad and went to the bathroom. I opened her Facebook app and found the proof I needed. Since earlier this afternoon, she had been sexting the guy some of the most descriptive things I've read; most of it stuff she won't do with me. I also discovered they were exchanging pictures back and forth...including the outfit she was wearing earlier that she claimed was to surprise me. The kicker of all this was when I read how they want to get together when he's back in the area. 

I may have invaded her trust by reading her Facebook messages, but when the girl I love turns into a totally different person, I needed to find out why.

I'm certain she doesn't know what I know about her conversations or what I've seen. After reading all of this, I'm completely disgusted. I don't think I'd ever be able to trust her again. We've been planning on buying a house together so that we could start thinking about starting a family, but after this, I don't think I want this relationship to continue.  

How should I approach this conversation? Am I overreacting? I just don't know what to do anymore...

Ever since I got a girlfriend I am giving him less and less time. We went abroad to study and everyone lives in a different city. Currently, Me and him usually play LOL almost every day for like 2 hours. He also visits and stays the weekend every 2 weeks. 

Since I got my girlfriend, he relates everything bad to her. every moment I don't spend with him he says because I was with her. I can say that I was the reason somehow because I used to talk to her a lot when me and my best friend visited each other, and I also spent much less time with him at the beginning of my relationship (first 6 months). That was because my girlfriend needed a lot of time, but we worked on that. 

My girlfriend moved to a close city after 1.5 years of a long distance relationship to do her internship. I like to stay with her a lot, its just that my friend does not like to talk to me or play with me when I am with her. I like to always stay with her except when my friend visits me, then I go back to my city. Since she came (3 weeks ago), I spent less time with my friend.  Say I talk to him once every 2 days, and he visited me the second last weekend, and he is visiting me again this weekend.

Now he says I am having sex with her, and that will make me spend less time with him. Also, As he thinks I have sex with her he says that she will cheat on me later because we had sex before marriage. He doesn't like sex before marriage.

First he asked me how long do you want to stay with her? I said a lot but not all the time. Now he recently asked me when I am coming back home this week, I told him Wednesday, and he said you lied to me and that I want to stay here all the time. and I really like to stay here all the time. 

He is very upset and he says bad stuff (like you are whores) and he fights because of this, and when we Skype he is upset and talks in a very depressive way.

He totally refuses seeing a psychologist, mentioning this possibility makes him furious.  

I am really upset of the last fight, and I want to tell him to cancel his train as I don't want to see him this weekend.

For most of my life, I have been morbidly obese and consequently lacked confidence and social skills.  I have had no significant romantic relationships apart from my ex-fiance, whom I was with throughout and somewhat after college.

In the past couple of years I have made tremendous changes in my life including losing over 100 pounds (I am now overweight but not obese and have some muscle) and trying to be more socially active and aware.  My career has had its ups and downs during this period, but I currently have a good job in San Francisco's financial district after moving from a more suburban area.  

Combining these improvements with my natural advantages (highly intelligent, tall, at least decent-looking) has evidently increased my appeal to women and has profoundly changed the nature of dating for me.  Where I used to struggle to even have a chance with one woman, I now find that I can attract multiple women (with effort; I don't want to overstate things).  

The trouble is that having not had this kind of attention in the past, I have not developed the social skills (and perhaps not the emotional maturity) to handle it.  I am also tremendously busy at work and my time and to a lesser extent energy is a very limited resource.

I met M at a chess meetup a little over a month ago, probably the last place I would have expected to meet a woman.  She clearly had no hope of beating me that day, but I really liked that she kept wanting to play and asked intelligent questions.  I offered to lend her a chess book so I'd have an excuse to invite her to lunch.  She is every bit as dedicated to her career as I am and thus we have only been able to meet a handful of times since then, but I have enjoyed all of them.  

On our second date (not counting the chess meetup), I tried to kiss her but she pulled away.  On our third date, she told me that she liked me and was attracted to me but wanted to try being friends first.  She told me she didn't expect me to wait for her (which I would not have been willing to do).  I don't usually become friends with people I date, but I made an exception for her because I actually saw a strong potential friendship, though that wasn't my first choice.

It is a good thing that M meant it when she told me not to wait, because I didn't.  I signed up for Match.com (not having as much time for social events due to my job) and found a very different world than the last time I tried the site.  I actually had a pretty decent response rate and rather enjoyed myself.  

I talked to a few different girls and went out with one that didn't go anywhere before I met C a couple weeks ago.  C and I have only met online as she has been in her native country on summer break from college.  We hit it off immediately and started texting each other frequently, even daily.  She has been very understanding and has pretty much worked around my schedule since she is much less busy.  At first our conversations where of the get to know you variety, but they quickly turned sexual and we have great mental sexual chemistry.  

Honestly, things between C and I progressed too quickly sexually and emotionally, especially given that we have not yet met.  I was completely honest and forthright about the fact that I am dating other people and not ready to make any commitments at the moment, again especially because we have not yet met.  She said she understood but asked not to hear anymore about other girls.  She also asked if I have had any sexual partners apart from my ex and I (honestly) answered no.  She returns to SF tomorrow and is intensely looking forward to seeing me and clearly wants sex (a perfectly reasonable expectation based on our conversations).

M and I had still been talking, but not much as we were both busy at work.  Since she didn't seem terribly interested and I was enjoying texting C, I thought that was that.  Five days ago, M messaged me out of the blue clearly wanting sex (and I'm not the most subtle when it comes to these things).  I was also completely forthright and honest with her that I was dating other girls, although I was attracted to her and glad she spoke up.  Neither that fact, nor the fact that I had a nasty cold and was an hour away, seemed to deter her.  We had sex that night and although it was touch and go for a while (it had been a really long time for me and I had some performance anxiety/not being used to a condom) the sex was good overall.  

M and I also had dinner Saturday night (after both of us worked all day Saturday) and afterwards had *amazing* sex.  Neither of us slept more than a few hours and we both shared a lot of fantasies with each other... and made some of them happen.  We also spent all day Sunday together at a slightly less frenzied pace and also watched a movie together.  

This is embarrassing, but I was feeling guilty and awkward about the whole two girls situation and I asked M if she wanted to be my girlfriend.  She quite understandably responded that I couldn't ask a question like that while my hand was inside her.  It is true that I was in the heat of the moment, but I was actually hoping that she would say yes because I really like her and I would then break things off with C and the situation would be resolved.  The latter reason is not a good one, but I can't expect decent help if I'm not honest with you guys.

I now feel very awkward when messaging C.  I don't feel I can tell her what happened because she asked not to hear about other girls.  Technically I am not in a committed relationship with anyone and probably have no obligation to tell, but this is new to me and I feel very guilty.  C is also almost certainly going to want sex and I don't feel it is honorable to do so without telling her that I have had another partner besides my ex (since she should be able to make an informed decision about the risks); yet I cannot tell her without going against her stated wishes.

I like C as well and she has been nothing but understanding.  Furthermore I do not know whether M even wants or has time for a boyfriend.  I don't really know where M sees things going, and it seems likely that that she doesn't know either, but we are clearly not in a committed relationship at the moment.  I intend to talk with M in more detail to gain some clarity, but it is hard to find a time that works for both of us (this isn't a conversation I want to have via text).  I haven't been messaging C as much in the last 5 days, but I am going to have to give her some kind of signal in the near future, probably before I have a chance to talk to M.

My logical mind says that it is permissible, even desirable, to date multiple women so long as I remain honest.  Yet I cannot help but feel guilty.  Furthermore, I do not understand the social aspects of the situation: is it more important to honor C's wishes by remaining silent or give her an informed choice by letting her know?  How much of a commitment to M is implied by having sex?  How much do flirting and emotionally bonding with C imply commitment?  How can I date two women without leading either one of them on but without unnecessarily bringing the subject up (which might hurt them or make them feel insecure)?

I understand that this was extremely long (I didn't even include what I see as the good and bad aspects of M and C) and is a trifling problem compared to many of the concerns posted here.  Thank you very much to anyone who offers feedback and advice.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

Edit: There is one positive note that I would like to leave.  To anyone out there who feels depressed, lonely, hopeless, etc... things can and will get better if you work on yourself (whether that means therapy, losing weight, battling an addict, etc).  It wasn't very long ago that I was unemployed, morbidly obese, utterly lonely, and so miserable that there were days I wanted to kill myself.  Now I have a very good job, live in one of the most dynamic cities in the world, am in good health, and am lucky enough to have the attention of two women who are each wonderful in their own way.

863,2vwr54,"Before this relationship, I was single for a 3.5 years. Recently I have started putting myself out there again. I found a potential girl who lives about an hour away and we hit it off via text and phone conversations. I tend to be a shy guy in general, and it does take me time to warm up to people. Due to working on my doctorate(medical field) and working towards becoming a military officer I tend to be extremely busy during the week.

So this whole dating thing is completely foreign to me. After our first date I noticed something slightly off about this girl. She for some reason will find it necessary after each date to pick out any and all flaws she can find in me and just list them off to me. Whether it be that she believes I am a bad kisser, that I was nervous, or that I don't act masculine enough the list goes on.

Then during the week when we are too busy to see each other the relationship becomes great. We send our typical happy go lucky texts, joke around on snap chat, flirt and have a healthy relationship. Even this valentines day (celebrated it yesterday due to work), she gets me the most thoughtful gifts, we have a laid back date, and then afterwards the slew of insults come in about how I am too skinny (170lbs 5'8''), not masculine enough, how her last boyfriend was more confident and how she'd never typically date someone like me, but that I am husband material. 

I had tried breaking up with her earlier in the week, but she insisted that she just takes time to warm up to people. Which I can sympathize with because I also find it hard to open myself up to others. My confidence right now is at an all time low, every date I have with this girl seems to tear apart another piece of me. I don't know how to interpret any of this, I know this isn't a healthy relationship but I prefer it to the alternative of remaining single. What should I do?

TL;DR Dating a girl who insults me after each date. Don't know if this is typical relationship behavior as I've never said a rude thing to her yet.

11,2ytbfn,"Hi there, this is my first time posting on r/relationships so try not to be too harsh. I'll try my best to keep it short. We have been dating for just under a year and can honestly say I love her to bits. She's honestly amazing and I'm sure she feels the same about me.

We are very intimate with each other at all times, always cuddling, hugging, kissing, spooning and we've been sleeping in the same bed for about 6 months. Everything seems perfect, we have our disputes and arguments but they are mainly solved really quickly (within an hour or two).

We share interests, we play video games together, watch the same TV shows together, and every weekend for as long as I can remember (with the exception of a few) we spend together. I would stay in her parents house (they don't mind) and we just chill out and have fun.

As aforementioned, our shared interests include sitting in together and engaging in these cosy little weekends which are the highlight of my week. I honestly look forward to it, as sad as it sounds at 18 years old. Whereas the majority of our friends are going out to bars and clubs getting ridiculously drunk and basically living student life. 

We have spoken about this topic and she says she really enjoys spending time with me at the weekends, she says she prefers our weekend arrangements than going out and get piss-drunk like what seems like 'everyone else'. I really dislike going out, I don't like getting drunk out of my head in an unsafe place. Until recently, she didn't either.

I live in Ireland and St Patrick's day is next week (yes the stereotypes are true, almost everyone, especially my age goes out and gets blitzed on every drink they can find) but as I said before, this doesn't appeal to me. So we were meant to spend this weekend (before St Patrick's) together, but she mentioned to me that we should go out with her friends on Friday to a well known club/bar.

Sadly, I knew her friends before I knew her, and some of my friends are mutually friendly with hers, it's kind of like a group. But since me and my girlfriend like sitting in and everyone else prefers going out 'on the rip' then we were quickly excluded from most group activity.

Her friends, in my opinion are really shit friends, they apparently talk about her behind her back (my friends tell me this), they cheat on their boyfriends, they get recklessly drunk and I tell her this as much as I possibly can, but she says she has no other friends other than this bunch, so I ignore it as long as I could.

I really don't feel safe with her going out with them, and normally I would accompany her as I honestly worry so much about her because I know what guys are like especially some of those that go to that club every week. If i accompany her, we spend the night together, have a few drinks, but I've decided I'm not going out this weekend but she insisted in going out herself with her friends without me (something she had never done before)

This got me kind of worried. I am a jealous person and I got pretty upset when she made new plans with her friends as opposed to have our cosy weekend as per usual. Am I being too overpowering or am I just reacting to being let down? I don't control her as I tell her she can do whatever she likes in relation to going out. I'm not going to tell her she CAN'T do something and treat her like a child.

So she picked up on my obvious discomfort and said she wouldn't go out this weekend. I am happy to hear this, but I was curious as to why. She didn't mention anything and I accepted, however I was still a little unsure as she just went from feeling so strongly about going out to not caring.

Then she dropped the bomb on me that we should go out for St Patrick's day with her friends instead. Of course. Only this time, there would be like maybe 3 or 4 times more people in the club. I really don't feel comfortable with it but I can't stop her. 

Is it normal for me to feel this way? Or am I being exceedingly jealous and possessive? She knows how i feel about this and I found it strange that she went from feeling so against going out to wanting to go out so much. I appreciate any feedback you can give me because I am wracking my brain over thinking situations and stuff. Thank you.

609,2avcpz,"So now i'm in this weird psuedo-relationship with a girl and I want it to be a full on relationship instead of this weird thing that I now have (but not bad?).

We were very close friends for a year before we started going out (we shared secrets and insecurities. I told her most of mine and I know some of hers).  We've always had a weird/close relationship.  For example, there was one point that we were seeing different people but spent christmas and new years together.  Then one day, when we both were single, we both drunkenly hook up.  We then go through a period of yes/no/yes/no until one day I just demanded to try it.  We went out for a couple of months, and there were often issues (there was no honey moon phase).  We tried to address them, but it didn't seem to work.  Then due to the stress of the issues not being able to be resolved, we both decided to end it.

Then we immedietely go back to being very close friends, to the point that it was by many accounts - weird.  Within a few days of breaking up, we were already spending time together.  She would come by and cook me dinner or we'll just do stuff together (we share simliar hobbies).  We both hinted at casual sex, but haven't done it yet. -   I feel it's too soon and might make things more confusing/weirder than it already is.

On paper it seems that I am getting tons of the benefit of this psuedo-relationship.  Like for example, we both want to see each other (she is fine with doing whatever I want, but often I'm also cool to do what she wants - it is a two way thing), she'll make me food, she'll listen to my problems, and she's more than happy to have sex. 
 
All of my friends have told me that she is essentially taking advantage of me and I should stop seeing her.  I would normally agree, but I seem to be getting tons of benefit out of this on a practical sense.  I guess the only real difference between this and a full on relationship is the commitment to exclusivity and acknowledgement from her that we are in a relationship (the latter is the essential bit).  I'm pretty much at loss with this.

***
So the core issue during our relationship was the fact that she found it difficult to confide problems with me.  She says when she's in a good mood, seeing me is the best thing ever since toast.  But she finds that when she is stressed or sad - when she meets up with me, I can't bring her out of her stressful/depressed state.  So she broke up the dating bit because she said that she can't have a boyfriend that she only wants to see when she's happy, but needs one for both the happy and sad times.  When we were going out, we tried to address this, but didn't it seem to work.

***
Since we've broken up, I've made a point to ask her and listen to her problems more and more.  But I don't know if that is enough or not.  But I also feel like we need time apart (we live in a small village), but it is difficult.  It feels very natural to meet up and do stuff together as well.  I don't know how to have time apart without resorting to I need time apart(which, I don't think will work well).

670,1jb3nh,"I posted something about the subject here a week or so ago. We've been together for 4 years and have a six month old. We've been living together for 2.5 years of the relationship.

Since I got pregnant, everyone and their mother has asked me if we're getting married. I mean, no bars held: *everyone*. Every member of his family, every member of my family. All his friends (even his *bitches and hos, bros 4 lyfe* friends), coworkers, whatnot. They all wanted to know, and overwhelmingly people were pissed off that he hadn't proposed. Again: even the most adamant I'm totally not ready for marriage guys were upset that he hadn't because of how long we've been together and, obviously, the kid. I had to talk people out of giving him stern talking-tos, and swore up and down to people that we would get married when we were ready. Leave him alone, don't pressure him. He doesn't talk to people about his feelings and/or relationships anyways.

Except the thing is that, well, I *did* want him to. I definitely don't want to get married *tomorrow*: I'm happy with doing the long engagement. We're both young, and while we both agree that getting married wouldn't really change anything in the relationship, I don't think we're ready for the actual marriage. We'd spoken about it in the past and agreed upon it and kids, but not since the pregnancy. But I want to get engaged, and I mean in the Pinterest-board, bookmarking rings when he goes to the bathroom kind of way. I'm tired of being the gf. We've been together long enough, and I'd be happy to spend the rest of my life with him. He's my best friend, and while he can drive me *absolutely batters* sometimes, I love him to death.

Well, today we had a fight. The subject isn't particularly relevant (my inheritance money: it's a my money vs. your money vs. our money thing.) Once we'd cleared the main subject away, he wanted me to keep airing out our dirty laundry. We have communication issues: during fights, he says I treat him like a child, and I say he dismisses how I feel. Pretty standard he said/she said argument stuff. It results in both of us bottling up how we feel until it explodes out, we fight, and then return to business as usual. For those of you who have seen Orange Is the New Black ((*good show*)), think the fight between Cal and his girlfriend in the trailer. That's foreplay... We put everything out there.

...But I said something I probably shouldn't have. He pressed me to tell him what was on my mind. I said I was too scared. He insisted. So I finally blurt out, oh-so-gracefully, I WAS GOING TO PROPOSE TO YOU, and then, even more gracefully, started crying. The conversation went like this:

&gt; **Me:** I WAS GOING TO PROPOSE TO YOU (*undignified crying*)

&gt;**Him:** Well, why didn't you?

&gt;**Me:** Honestly, I was going to. But then I worked myself up and convinced myself that you were going to say no, so I didn't.

&gt;**Him:** ...That's not exactly how proposals work. The idea is to say yes.

&gt;**Me:** I KNOW. That's why I didn't do it. I didn't want to ask you because I was scared you'd say no. I'm not going to ask you to marry me if I think you're going to say no. 

&gt;**Him:** It's not like marriage is going to change who we are or the relationship.

After that the conversation drifted off. We were talking about buying a house, but after the argument/discussion (in light of the original subject), we agreed to put it off until if/when we get married. Not worth the headache it would cause us right now as two (legally) single individuals with varying credit scores, down payment savings, and income.

But that leaves me in a really awkward position. I've just told him that I wanted to propose, chickened out, but still want to get engaged. From his response, I think he tried to tell me he would have said yes. But now my cards are all out on the table. He knows. Now, any element of surprise on the matter is gone. We didn't agree to anything: there was no, well, why don't we? It just felt like... I don't know. Like I told him what he was getting for Christmas in advance. He definitely didn't seem upset about it, but wasn't jumping around the room cheering.

I feel like the world's biggest idiot. I have no clue what to do now. Should I plan something out? Have I been given the official go-ahead to propose? Wait longer? I don't know. Someone tell me what to do.

Apologies for the length. I appreciate your time. Names have been edited for privacy.


My (now ex) best friend Sandra and I have known each other for about 4 years; we met at college, hit it off, and kept in touch after graduating. I was a bridesmaid at her wedding; she was one of my 'sisters' at mine (I'm Hindu - this has a point later, I promise).


About a year after they got married, Sandra and her husband Greg started having some problems. They fought very often, over his drinking issues, and his inability to keep his eyes and hands off other women. I knew Greg had anger issues, and lent an ear and a shoulder to Sandra several times; I became her go-to person whenever she wanted to vent. If things were going well for her, she would never keep in touch. I tried my best to keep the friendship alive by calling and texting, and meeting up with her for coffee (where I always ended up paying), but I never got the same in return.


On one night two years ago, Sandra invited my husband and I for dinner with them. She explained that because of money issues, we'd be going dutch; I was perfectly fine with it, and I was actually happy that we'd get to see each other after a while. We met at the restaurant, and everything was going well - I noticed that Sandra and Greg were ordering the pricier items on the menu, and quite a few drinks, which seemed odd if they had money problems, right? But hey, who am I to judge - maybe they had something to celebrate.


Halfway through the dinner, Sandra got up to go to the restroom, and husband got an urgent call from work and stepped outside to take it. This left me and Greg alone. I asked him how his work was going, but instead of replying, he grabbed hold of my hand, told me that he'd been in love with me for ages, and asked me to sleep with him! I pulled away and declined forcefully - I told him I was married and was very happy with my husband. He made several rude comments about my husband, several crude comments about my body, and despite my husband returning to the table, did not stop until Sandra came back.


Husband and I were totally shocked, and soon after made our excuses to leave. We asked for separate checks, and this set off Greg again. He said that today was their anniversary, and that we were obliged to pay for them as a gift. We politely declined, and I told him Sandra told me that we were going dutch. Sandra proceeded to tell me that I was a 'cheap ass bitch' who 'didn't care about her at all'. I was going to reply when husband pulled me away and told me that they were probably drunk, and we left.


Two days later, I get a call from her, and she apologizes for calling me those names. Okay, not bad. Then she essentially blames her outburst on me, saying that if only I'd paid for them, none of that would have happened. Oh, and because I'd 'forced' them to pay for themselves, they didn't have enough money for rent, so I now 'owed' them $500. I declined again, reiterated that she told me dinner was dutch, and that I had no money to lend her. She hung up in a huff.


I was still trying to figure out the best way to tell her about Greg's comments to me. I spoke to a few close friends of mine, and I came to the conclusion I need to tell her as soon as possible. So the same evening, I called her up and in the nicest way possible told her what Greg had told me. I even told her that I wasn't sure if it was because he was tipsy, but I thought she needed to know. She seemed shocked, and thanked me for letting her know, and that I shouldn't worry about it. 


The next day, she calls me up, puts me on speakerphone, and she and Greg lambaste me for being a 'homewrecker', a liar, a dirty cheat, etc., etc., As it turns out, when he was confronted, Greg told her that I came on to him, and she chose to believe him (despite his past failings). I told her she was crazy, and hung up.


I would have left the matter at that and continued the friendship, but she and Greg went around trying to spread rumors among our friends that I was a slut, a whore, blah blah blah. None of our friends believed her, having witnessed Greg's wandering eye (and, as I came to know later, been on the receiving end of his crudeness), so the only thing that happened was that they were cut off from our friend circle. Of course, she painted herself as the victim and blamed it all on me.

I had had enough by this time, and called her up one last time and told her to never contact me again, and that our friendship was done. I didn't have any contact with her after that. A year later, I heard from mutual friends that she caught Greg cheating on her and they got a divorce. By this time, I'd moved on, and didn't give it any thought.


A year after their divorce was when the madness started. She called me up, and asked to meet me, saying that she wanted to apologize for the past. We met up at a coffee place, where she first tried to get me to pay for her coffee (I didn't) whereupon she apologized, and asked if we could be friends again. I told her that it had been nice seeing her, but after all that she had said and done, I had no interest in resuming our friendship, and we parted amicably.

The next day, she called me several times while I was at work (20, to be exact) and had left me several messages, each of them a variation of 'I said sorry, why can't we be friends again, please be my friend'. (I didn't get her messages through the day because I have bad signal where I work). I sent her a polite message asking her to stop calling and texting me, and essentially told her again that we could not be friends.

That weekend, she showed up suddenly at our doorstep when we were returning from grocery shopping. She asked to come in, but my husband told her we were about to have friends over, and it was not a good time. Her reply? 'Well, I'm (x's) friend, so I should also be invited'. He politely told her to leave.

From that day, I get at least 10 messages a day from her. She shows up everywhere I go (at least, it seems that way.) For example, husband and I will be having dinner at a restaurant - 10 minutes after we're there, she shows up (with someone else; no idea who the other person is) and will try to join our table, to which we always refuse. If we're shopping? She's there, shopping too. The only time she doesn't show up is when we are hanging out with our old friends (it turns out she did the same thing to them too, and they're still angry about it).

She has also gotten her pastor to *come to my house* to talk to me; essentially getting him to tell me that she has changed, that she's a better person, that forgiveness is good, and so on. This was so creepy to me; do pastors actually go to people's houses on other people's behalf? (not Christian, so I don't know).


I'm not sure why she's targeted me, but no matter how many times husband and I have told her, she doesn't stop. I can't make out if she's stalking me or not, because it could be a coincidence she is at the same public place as we are, but she always shows up after us... I don't know what to think. Husband has told me I need to contact the police for a restraining order, but part of me thinks she's just disturbed and needs help, and while I don't want her trying to prise herself back into my life, I don't want to ruin her life either.

What's the best thing to do in this situation?

507,2t6cua,"A little backstory, I met a girl a few months back.  We hit it off like nothing ever before in my life, or hers.  She lives in another state, but visits family out here.  She is independent, has her own place, and we joked about me going to live with her so I could be closer.  Well, I took the plunge and went out there about a month ago.  I was hesitant to make it my home, because I didn't want to get hurt.  She assured me everything is good though, so I let that life become my new one, and my new home.  Walking her dogs, taking care of the house, looking for work in a new area.


Fast forward 3 weeks, she is acting different, she has always had anxiety problems, I finally get it out of her that she has anxiety with me being there all the time.  She went from living on her own, to having me there all the time with no real privacy.  I understand that, so I agreed to go home.  We Said we would stay together, just not live together yet.


I ended up leaving earlier than I planned, I wanted her to get comfortable faster, and I was simply in pain, I wanted to get it over with.  She wasn't happy about how I left, we had some emotional exchanges while I was driving back, she told me just to keep going home though, even though I wanted to turn around and come back to make it better.


We slowly over the last few days have gotten back to normal, I tell her I love her, she says she loves me back etc.  We make small talk.  She doesnt know I am dead inside though, I wake up nightly with panic attacks about losing her, I can't eat much.  My life is hell not knowing if we are going to be ok.


So yesterday I tell her about my anxiety, and how I want her to just comfort me a bit with things.  She gets upset, and says I keep bringing up stuff making her not want to talk to me.  I told her I just have so much anxiety, I need her to help me.  I told her I moved out to help her with her anxiety, now I was hoping she could do this to help me with mine.  She got really upset, telling me to f*** off with the guilt trips.  Then she said she was turning off her phone.  


I told her I didn't mean to guilt trip her, that I love her, and I will give her space.  It has now been 14 hours.  I don't know if I should keep the no contact, or if I should send her a single text to say I'm sorry, and I love her.  This girl has once told me she loves me more than anything, and wants to be with me for life.  Before all this though.

We parted ways once the semester ended but after talking to each other once we got back to school, we realized that we both had feelings for each other. There was no official label on it, but we have been seeing each other for about the past two months.

I've enjoyed spending time with him a lot and I know that he has too, but the one problem is that he is just SO BUSY. We are both in agreement that we both like each other a lot and want to be exclusive with only each other. However, he is involved with my school's ROTC program, while I am a civilian, and as an upperclassman with a leadership role it takes up a significant amount of his time. He is really dedicated to his work which I respect a lot. 

The problem is that he just tends to disappear on me without warning. For example, we had made plans to have lunch together on Friday, so a few hours in advance I texted him just to confirm. No response, so I ended up eating by myself. He answers me later that evening saying that he got caught up in ROTC stuff and he was very sorry, which I believe was sincere. There have been a few similar instances, but each time he did apologize and we ended up seeing each other at a later time. Not so for the latest instance.

1154,2f1ru8,"Hey everyone,

I'll try to keep this as succinct at possible. 

April - I meet this girl online and it's one of the best first dates ever. She's beautiful, and I'm instantly infatuated with her. She appears to feel the same. 

April/May - The courtship progresses. We meet each other's friends/family, and all seems well. Sex is good. She appears really into me, and does some really great things to make me feel like she's thinking long-term. 

June - She breaks it off, citing something isn't there for her (passion, butterflies, etc). My friends (who met her and got to know her) say she's crazy, she's lying to herself, and that she'll end up calling me down the line. She never does. 

Anyway, I've tried and tried to let her go since it ended. I tried not dating (focusing on myself and my own life ambitions), with the intent that I wouldn't need someone in my life to make me feel complete. To be honest, it's just made me feel lonlier; even with the strides I've made personally/professionaly. 

We only dated two months, and I feel really stupid for missing her like I do. At this point, I've missed her longer than we were together. 

The reason I didn't go back to dating right away was because I felt, after the way she made me feel, dating anyone immediately after would be a mistake. I'd just be rebounding, and not be dating anyone on their own terms. In other words, I didn't want to hurt someone else. 

I'm tired of venerating the memory of this girl, and I'm tired of feeling like I can't date anyone else because the grief is still there. What do you think I should do?

I am in what I am starting to wonder, an abusive relationship, but I just don't know what I'm doing that is so wrong as to deserve it.


A bit of background- A few months into my relationship with my girlfriend, lets call her Jenny in the interest of ease, I found out that she was texting her ex boyfriend and telling him she loved him, him asking if they could meet etc etc. There was evidence of them calling one another too, but as to the length and frequency of the calls I am unsure, because she deleted all evidence of them existing. 


My suspicions were first piqued when I saw her phone light up as we were watching a film on the sofa. Everything was going great, if too fast for me. She'd already told me she loved me, and I was scared shitless because I didn't feel 2 months was long enough to say it, I don't really know whether or not I was wrong to feel that way because she's spent the past year telling me, that I am.
Anyway, it was from some guy called Ian. She'd told me her ex was called Robert, and that they didn't talk any more, so I wondered who it was that was texting her with 'hey beautiful xxx' at 11pm called Ian.


Fast forward to the end of the film, and she went downstairs to raid my fridge. I went to the toilet and noticed as I got out of bed, that her phone had fallen out of her pocket and into the bed. Feeling incredibly guilty, I went to the toilet and took it with me. I knew her password because she had this trust issue of being able to access my phone, so I made it my business to sneak a look at her password and one day managed to see it. I'm not proud of this, but I'd recently watched Hot Fuzz, and Simon Pegg's line of 'Often the guilty person makes the first move' and it kinda stuck with me.


So there I am taking a dump and well, thank god I already had my pants down because by the time I'd gotten about two swipes into the conversation, I knew she'd been seeing him, I knew this Ian was the real name of her ex, and I knew that she'd been telling him things like 'I love you still.' I felt sick, thankfully it came spewing out of the other end, but after I finished I just couldn't move. I was shaking and sad, not angry just sad. It felt like someone had punched me in the stomach. I've never been cheated on before so I had no idea how to deal with it all, so I went downstairs shaking and she asked what was wrong.


I sat down and said nothing, just looked at her and started to cry, and she knew that I knew. I could see it in her eyes. She looked upset, and asked me again, I guess to find out what I knew. I told her everything I had read about and asked her if they'd met up, she told me yes and that he came to see her after work. We both work at the same place, I remembered the night she said he came. I remember texting her and her getting back late, I remember how normal she acted after she replied a few hours later, I remembered it all. Cue my dog running downstairs to see what was going on, jumping on my stomach, and long story short I threw up on my dog.


Amidst crying and shame, I asked her to leave and she started crying in earnest. Again in the interest of saving your time, I met her the day after and she explained that he was saying things like he was going to kill himself if she stopped talking to him, etc. That he came to her work out of the blue and dropped some things he'd left at her place at the time, etc.


Turns out he was her old high school teacher. She's young, I met her when she was 18. They'd been together 'just after she left high school' but I don't really believe that even to this day.
 
I don't know about other countries, but in the UK high school ends at 16, so he'd taught her Business from 14-16, they'd had no romantic moments, and as soon as she left school they started dating. M'kay.


Anyway, whatever. So she dated some young high school teacher. That's fucked up, I should report him but she doesn't want me to. I don't even know what his real name is, so how can I? What proof do I have? Should I be this involved?

That's when she finally tells me.

'He is a bit older than me.'

'How old?'

'...'

'How old..?'

'...40's...'

Holy. Shit. Am I wrong in this in and of itself, not being a really big deal? Should age matter? I'm 6 years older myself... Nope I can't shake the feeling that this, coupled mainly with the fact that he had a mentoring responsibility to her and other classmates of her age for god knows how many years, is just... wrong.

Oh I found out about a year later that he's actually 55, and was seeing her whilst he was getting divorced. His wife instigated it, and looked a lot like Jenny. Yeah.


So with this hanging over me, I decided to call it a day. It'd been a nice two months so far, but I didn't really see how I was meant to trust her after that. This is why I am telling this bit. Because of the trust point. I'm not going to lie, I didn't take it like some people can. I was upset and I said some mean things. I called her a bitch for lying, and a cheat. I told her I didn't see how I was meant to trust her any more and that I had never been cheated on so I was sorry for how I was reacting to it all.

She cried, and boy can she cry. After 4 years of acting lessons, her eyes literally don't stop dripping, but this seemed earnest and genuinely sad. After a long, long talk I decided to try and make it work. I was lonely, I'd just come back from travelling and landed a dead end, shit job. The only good thing about it was that I met her there. The main thing was, that I cared about her. A lot. Even when I got upset, I didn't raise my voice, I saw her as a responsibility for some fucked up reason.


I saw the fact that she'd had a relationship with a middle aged man from 16 onwards, as something that would have misguided her a lot, and blamed Ian for all this, more than her. But wasn't it her choice too? God, I just didn't know. I still don't. I'm so confused.


To the present day though, and to what I was going to ask advice for in the first place- Am I an 'evil self centred little cretin' for wanting to go away mid-year for a week away on an island off the coast of England with a few friends? Amongst them is my best friend of many, many years and his fiancé, and our mutual friends, but I haven't met two of them yet. 


Jenny says I am being self centred and that she'll split up with me, sleep with other guys namely guys that she pretends are a threat to us (when she gets mad at something, she says she's driving to see this guy, lets call him 'Adam' to fuck him. She sends me pictures of landmarks on the way to the town he lives in, and tells me to go off and sleep with a girl from work that she has a problem with because she saw her staring at me one day at my current job.) 


What am I doing that is causing this? I can't figure it out. I helped a lady pick up her groceries after her bag split in the supermarket with Jenny there, and she called me a cheat. Once, I helped an old man cross the road when the pedestrian crossing wasn't working, because I had a high vis vest with me from work and it was dark. The guy walked really slowly and it was so windy that he was worried he'd fall over. I'd seen him on my way home up a long straight road that I used to walk, and he was trying to flag down people that walked past him, for help so I felt sorry for him. 


She slapped me across the face when we got off the main road and told me I was an inconsiderate cunt because I never link arms with her when we cross the road, then literally ran away from me, and running across the main road again without looking. She later told me if she'd have been hit, it was my fault and that if she'd died it would be on me forever.


The fucked up thing is I can feel myself starting to believe all the things she says. I still love her, but I don't know why. Sometimes when there's absolutely nothing to anger her, she turns back to how she was before I found out about her and Ian still talking. It's amazing. I had a family member with Alzheimers and it was exactly the same as the lucid moments when he remembered things that you'd talk to him about, and even make comments about them. I feel like I want to cry when she's normal again.


So, am I wrong to go on this holiday with my friends? She says we'd be over, slammed my door so hard she broke the catch, I still have the bruises from her punching and biting me as I tried to pull over when she saw my phone light up with my best friend asking if I'd booked the time off for the holiday yet.


I guess I should have told her, but he'd only propositioned me with the idea late the previous night, and I had an early start at work the day in question. It just slipped my mind to tell her...


Should I go? What am I doing? It's hard to get out of bed. Please help me.

So we've been dating for almost three years (3 year in May) and things have mostly been amazing. I have a lot of things I have ever wanted with this girl. She makes me happy, I can talk to her, she's beautiful without make up/with make up on. She's got a beautiful mind and caring heart. She puts others before herself in most situations. I can name a lot of things. Most of the negatives (I actually just made a good and bad list and half of her bad qualities are fixable) can be fixed over time. 

The thing that really worries me the most is the future. I love this girl now, but I honestly don't know if I want to spend the rest of my life with her kind of love. The reason I mention this is because we have been dating for so long (at least in our eyes) we might as well end up getting married. That really scares me honestly. She wants to have kids and I do too, I think? I want to move out of my dad's house (saving up money after college w/ fulltime job) but she thinks its dumb for me to not wait for her so we can buy a place together instead. I find this completely unrealistic and I always think about what if we break up? One of us will be homeless, etc

She wants to have kids by her late twenties because some weird thing about women needing to produce kids at that age for them to be healthy (Honestly that's probably not it, but I can't remember it exactly). All I know is kids are on her agenda by the end of her late twenties.

I am mostly happy with how things are going NOW so I don't think I should throw it away now but Im worried that she's taking things too fast and Im scared to bring it up or to ask her to slow it down.

Throughout our relationship he has always been a light drinker, sometimes bringing home a bottle of wine after a long week and we drink together. Even out in public he never drinks more than a glass and he has never struck me as a violent guy but our relationship is suffering.

Six months ago his Father died due to lung cancer, he and I spent as much as time as possible before he passed away but it's been very hard on him. His Father was the closest thing to him, he has a past of an abusive mother so they have a very close bond. Since his Father has passed away my boyfriend has become a different man, I've noticed him quiet and reserved to himself and he started smoking and bringing home the hard liquor. I've noticed he's become far more aggressive than I've ever seen him in our relationship, he doesn't project it onto me but I can see from the way he talks and goes about his business that he looks agitated all the time. I've brought up the idea of therapy and I've voiced my concerns and he's always just told me to back off. He skips out on work frequently and all he does is chug down a bottle of whiskey and end up passing out on the couch.

Last night we spent the night together, it was wonderful and I felt things were starting to get better but I was wrong. He left the bed during the middle of the night and I thought he was using the bathroom so I waited for him, time passed so I went out. I found him in the kitchen pouring vodka into a bottle of water when he heard me he turned around trying to hide it. I confronted him and he just kept on brushing it off and then he snapped, threw the bottle of vodka across the room to the wall. He just looked at me for a second then he broke down into tears and was apologizing I hugged him and tried to calm him down before taking him to bed.

I don't know what to do and I'm feeling really scared for what his current path could lead to, I love this man and I want to be able to help him out of this dark time but I don't know where to start.

1179,20009i,"Me and my Girlfriend have been together since high school and we have had our ups and downs. There were times when we both fought and both took each other for granted. But even despite the fighting, the good times always seemed to shine through all the shit.

 She expressed to me times that she felt like I only wanted to be with her when I was horny, even though I would always do so much more than just have sex with her. Just different things girls tend to complain about because they either don't understand how guys minds work, or they are insecure (which she was, majorly), etc. 

I felt I showed my love in other ways by always making sure she was doing well and was eating enough-(her family is poor, and she was hypoglycemic and her mom barely ever went grocery shopping) I'd invite her over any time she told me she felt hungry, just so she could get a bite to eat.

When she was still in high school, I always made sure she had a ride home. I felt that she did not deserve to have to walk home, just because her mom was too busy to pick her up. 

I always cuddled her and made her feel comfortable, before and after every time we fought about stupid petty shit. I never just sent her home crying and made her feel alone. But the way she complained about our fights, it was like I was never allowed to be irritated with her for anything. 

Yes, I will admit, there were times when she would express her concerns to me, and I would get defensive, but she would do the same, its why we fought; we were both stubborn.

 There were times when she never wanted to go anywhere or do anything. I was at the time a outgoing person and loved to go surfing, hiking, camping, vacationing...etc. For some reason or another, she would go through phases where she didn't want to do much else but sleep and watch T.V. I could always tell she was naturally very introverted, and just getting herself to go out and be with other people took every ounce of strength and energy she had.

Well about 8 months ago, I began feeling that her insecurities were weighing me down a little, and I had only known her for so long that I made it clear I wanted to take a break. I hung out with other people, talked to other girls, had a crush and then let it go.

I decided that I missed her. All I needed was time away from her as she had begun to get a little needy. I wanted a chance to go out and adventure as myself. But that excitement left and I realized where I was comfortable. Not only that but I missed my best friend.

Well I tried to get back together with her, but she had met another guy, and was rebounding with him. Almost 10 years older than her, sickly looking, pale, just very out of character for her. I'd expected to see her with someone so much different. 

We tried to work things out, we spent 3 or 4 months together. At first she was so into me again after spending a few weeks softening her heart towards me, and the first time we had sex again was fucking amazing. I had never seen her so into me. 

Sadly that didn't last and she eventually told me that she had been seeing another guy two weeks after our breakup. It only took her that short amount of time to forget about me. She told me she didn't love me any more and the feelings weren't there. Turns out she had put him on the back-burner while spending time with me; he had been convinced they were dating the whole time, even though she never went to see him. She was always with me.

Now she claims she loves him and that she wants to be with him. She just fell out of love. I've never been one to believe that, and knowing her, I wouldn't be surprised if she is merely infatuated with him because he was there for her at a time when she was desperate. Its rebounding I think, but shes convinced, so I have to let her go. Shes also been one to always shield her feelings, and throw walls up around her emotionally when shes hurting. Its like if she doesn't care about the person, they can't hurt her, or so she convinces herself.

Maybe shes going through what I did when I took a break from her the first time. I don;t know, all I know is that I love her as a human being and best friend, even if the romance became a tiny bit stale now and then. I feel a part of me is lost and it sucks.

78,35a4p7,"I've been seeing my bf (let's call him Dave) for about a year, but we've only been official for about a month. 

When I wear shorts or a dress, he makes comments about how other guys are looking at me. Like, When you were wearing those shorts today, so and so was totally looking at your ass. Normally it wouldn't bother me but he says it in such a way (accusatory) that it feels like it's my fault for wearing them. When I dress up he gets insecure because people will be looking at me. I dunno, I try to forget the comments but he makes me feel slutty for wearing normal things, like a sundress. When I hang out with ANY guy, he feels uncomfortable. He told me the other day that, girls put pins in guys so they can date them if anything goes wrong in their relationship. 
He assumes that every guy I talk to, ones I've known for years and have never put the moves on me, are just waiting for their time to get in my pants. Or that I'm saving them for later. If I'm texting someone, he automatically assumes I have cheating on the mind, and if a guy friend comments on my Facebook posts a lot they are too friendly. 
Dave isn't a social kind of guy, he doesn't see that much value in friendships, but I am a very social person, who because of extenuating circumstances in life hasn't been able to socialize very well until this year. I'm looking for friends, and he's shutting down every time by accusing anyone I talk to of checking me out or wanting to date me. He's used the classic I trust you, not them excuse like I can be persuaded by just anyone. 
I can see where he is coming from, from a certain viewpoint. When we met, I had been hanging out with a guy, who went a little crazy and stalked me for the first month or so I knew him. Maybe from his viewpoint I was involved with someone when I started dating him, but it just wasn't so. I have explained this to him. His last girlfriend cheated on him, or so he thinks, because she is dating the guy he suspected and she was interacting with during the end of their relationship.

I recently made a friend at a party we were BOTH at, he met him too, is friends with him on FB, who shares a common thing with me, we both suffer from PTSD. So we started chatting, and honestly, it's been nice to be able to talk to someone who understands the struggle. I didn't mention we were talking, and he saw on my phone that I had a text from him. I dunno how, but he did. Anyway he accused me of lying, and as a reflex because I didn't want him to be mad, I told him I wasn't texting him... I should not have done that, I know, but I didn't want to endure the snarky comments and lectures that had come in the past when I tried to make a new friend. 

On my day off this week I went to the park and didn't tell him exactly what I did there and he accused me of hanging out with this person and lying about it. Sigh. I hang it with him in LITERALLY all of my spare time when he isn't working. I finally told I'm I had been texting this person but didn't want to tell him for fear of him being super negative. He accused me of emotionally cheating and lying. I know I didn't handle it well... But that seems extreme to me. I would NEVER cheat. I've been cheated on and I know how it feels. He knows that. I don't understand why this is such an issue. I'm starting to flinch when I have to check my phone, or putting it away when he walks up, which to him is a red flag. 
When I try to make a girl friend, he isn't as weird, but just assumes I'm texting a guy and hiding it with a girl name, so I end up again, with no friends because I don't want to fight, and everything else about him I adore. What do I do? Is there a way to talk to him about this without seeming like I'm accusing him...? Is there a way to work on this and salvage the relationship? How can I better understand why he feels this way? I feel like he slut shames me for this, and the way I occasionally dress, which is NOT slutty at all. 

Tl;dr I feel like my bf slut shames me for having guy friends and wearing shorts and dresses. Can it be resolved somehow? 

EDIT: I dunno why, but I needed some outside opinions to validate that his actions weren't okay. I've been rationalizing that it's because he's been hurt before and was over protective of me, but you guys are right. It's not okay to spend so much emotional time trying to please this behavior. I want to help him... But it's not my place if he continues to act like this. Underneath it all I feel like he is a good person, but it's not acceptable to isolate me or make me feel bad. He needs to work this put in his own head. I'm gonna have a talk with him next time I see him, and go from there. Send me some good energy so I can have the strength to stand my ground. 

EDIT #2: I said it in one of the comments, but I'll repeat it here, I've been so busy trying to prove my innocence I haven't even begun to think about questioning his. Read up on this projection business and he has all the signs. When I stop to look and scrutinize his behavior like he's been scrutinizing mine, I see those red flags he loves to bring up all over. I feel a little like you guys have sent me on a mission. This feels closer to the truth to me than him becoming physically abusive down the line or anything so drastic. No doubts now that his controlling behavior will escalate though. Thank you so much for commenting everyone! You've given me a lot to ruminate on.

405,2uclnl,"I've posted about this woman before, 

I was all set to move on I had been gradually not calling her anymore not texting anymore and removed her from all social media. She has been relentless with not letting me do no contact. which is why I opted for limited contact. I just let her do all the conversation initiation I never reached out on my own.

After about two months of this i caved in and said maybe i'm being childish about this. 

Because honestly we used to be so close as friends before we were something more. So we decided to meet at a bar at a local college town. She was so happy that I decided to meet her but that's when the tension started. We made plans on tuesday to meet on Friday which was yesterday. 

On Wednesday she called and asked if us meeting means we're friends and she's unsure where I am in her life. I said i dunno lets just take it one thing at a time and try to meet. she agreed. 

A friend of ours was promoting a band and i said maybe we should go to the gig and listen to them play. She had huge reservations she said I dunno if I want to go. Because I want to have good quality time with you alone just you and me. She asked if we could just goto the local town bar to our old spot I had reservations about that and i sorta convinced her to go to the college town. 

We hit the first bar. Its good wasn't awkward. she lied about some things which i knew was her way to prevent an argument. Then i said lets go to the gig and we'll have a good time. 

We get there. I make some instant friends i'm the center of attention she meets some new people she's having fun. It felt like old times where we just mix with different people and enjoy the social nature of life. its a good vibe UNTIL i hear her talking about her boyfriend (the guy she left me for).

She comes back to the bar where i'm at with my people and she's all smiles and asks if i want to share a drink. I said sure, then i told her listen After this drink i'm just going to take you back home to your guy and call it a night.

She immediately got upset and asked me why i'm being a jerk. I said listen. You can do all these things meet different people and go out and have fun with your dude. You don't need me to do it.

And she's like do you have any idea how suffocating it is to be around someone all day every day? (she lives with him, he hates going out and is pretty much dependent on her for any social life). 

I said no because the people I date or are interested in have the same interest I do so We always have fun TOGETHER. I'm like don't you think that's a fucking problem with your relationship?

She agreed that it was and that's why she was out with me because me and her are one in the same with our interest and she's like i have so much fun with you.

Anyway it fell apart after that. Our much larger group combined and decided to go to another bar. she rode in another car and at the new bar we ignored each other completely. In fact I struck up a conversation with a really cute girl on purpose right in front of her and she flipped and vanished. To which i apologized to the cute girl and told her to enjoy her night. 

Outside the bar later in the night I told everybody i was going home. I looked to her and she said she was going to our friends party at his house. At this point she's drinking heavily and is pretty drunk.

I just say ok and with no hesitation turn around and walk to my car. Didn't look back and left her at the college town to find another ride home.

In my eyes we are to far gone. I'm to invested in my emotions towards her and I want more. and she wants to stay safe and be with a man she's not even happy with. its obvious. But for her its an easy choice. Be with a guy who's outgoing and has lots of attention or stay safe and be with a guy who doesn't even have any male friends let alone get attention.

How should i play this? i feel that I should go STRICT no contact and just allow myself to overcome these emotions I have for her. And then MAYBE approach friendship. But as of right now I can't deal with being friends just hearing his name is a trigger that burns me from the inside out until there's nothing but negativity in my heart.

Talk to a cute girl in front of her she gets pissed vanishes and later on when I leave she says she's going to a party so I walk away without looking back and go home without her leaving her to find her own ride home.

This past Saturday I pretty much embarrassed myself and my boyfriend in front of his friends. We went bar hopping with a fairly large number of people and I was having a blast up until his ex showed up and crashed the party. After that I went a little psycho and gave him a bunch of crap. The night ended with us yelling at each other outside of the bar in front of his friends and him walking me back to the apartment and calling it a night. 

This past week I still gave him crap for whatever that happened... and out of frustration yesterday I told him that he should just go hang out with his friends this weekend instead. Later on that night I decided to call him, we talked, and things seemed cool. I preceded to ask him when he wanted to hang out, he said I don't know. So I said, You still want to hang out July 4? He replied by saying that he already made plans since I told him to do his own thing. I recoiled and told him that I'm sorry for saying that and I'd love to hang out. I thought that maybe if I just let my pride down, he'd see my sincerity and want to spend the day with me. I didn't want him to ditch the plans he had with his friends either. I wanted to also join and make good with them.... redeem myself from last weekend. Instead he refused and claimed to call my bluff, will hold me to what I said, and wishes to not hang out that day. My boyfriend told me that after the embarrassment I put him through last weekend he's too ashamed to bring me around his friends and that he also is sick and tired of me threatening him and therefore decided to hold me to it. 

I can't help but feel like this is a little unfair and that he's trying to discipline and teach me a lesson. I understand that I acted like a foolish bitch, but I don't understand why he has to punish me for it. I feel like he's fighting fire with fire, and even after I recoiled he is still sticking to his guns. 




UPDATE: Just read through the comments. I know I just posted up this post like 10 mins ago, but reading through all your input has brought a lot of clarity to the situation. I was an asshole and should respect his decision. Currently, he's not talking to me (or maybe even done with me) because I told him I should date other guys when he was persistent on not wanting to hang out with me this weekend. Yes, I threw another tantrum and acted childish when he wouldn't cave into my demands. Hopefully we'll talk soon and I'll let him know that I understand where he's coming from. I love him, and I owe him a real apology. Thanks a lot guys!

Current situation: it's been a year that I haven't spoken or had any type of contact with this guy and his wife emails me. She says they are good and happy and starting to heal and that if I'd like she'd like us to talk one of these days, that she feels that I wasn't the problem but the consequence.

We had a long, drawn out, dramatic breakup. Both of us did horrible things to each other. Her family hates me and vice versa. I obsessively did not want her to leave, but eventually we stopped talking for months. She came back for a couple months, begging me to take her back. I did. I was still in love with her. Still am. She left again. We stopped talking for four months because she got a girlfriend. I respected their relationship. She would get really drunk about once a month and call me. We would talk about this and that until she would start talking about how much she wants me to fuck her. The next day she would say we need to stop talking and we would. This has happened on and off again for about 6 months.

Her ex dumped her and she calls me the next day apologizing because she now understood how I felt when she left me. We meet up and talk. I tell her I won't sleep with her. We end up in bed anyway. I have zero willpower when it comes to her. We talk for a week and I can't contain myself anymore. I'm still in love with her and want to be more than just a fuck for her. She shuts me down and we stop talking for another month.

She starts sending me sexy pictures a week ago. I play her game like an idiot. Its fun while it starts. I haven't been with anyone else and it is nice to be sexually gratified. We talk on the phone and her voice is magic. I never fell out of love with her and I want nothing more than to be back to our old life before all the trouble started. I try to suppress this. She makes an okcupid account and I start to lose it. I feel violated knowing she shuts down my romantic desires with her when an army of guys on the internet want to just fuck her and not treat her right. I know, that sounds stupid, but my imagination runs wild with jealousy. She will probably meet someone who treats her right and who she loves. She will just forget about me one day.

I try to get out. I spend time with friends and family. I keep busy with work. I try new hobbies. I work on myself and exercise but she is always there in the back of my head and in my heart. Its like I can't escape. I really miss being in love and want to be in a relationship, but I am her prisoner and I keep the key from myself.

We have a mutual friend who says she just does this as a power trip when she is feeling low because she knows I will fall for it every time. I don't know why I think things will be different every time she gets ahold of me. I guess I just stupidly hope.

My boyfriend Alex and I are both college students, and we've currently been home for summer break for the past couple of months. Alex has an older brother (let's call him Pat), who is in his mid-30s and has recently moved back in with his and Alex's parents for financial reasons (Pat is not currently working).  Pat and his new wife and their newborn son and pug all live in the finished attic. 



   However, Pat also has a 16 year old son, Aidan, who lives with his mother and Pat's ex-girlfriend, on the other side of town. Aidan and Alex grew up together and are reasonably good friends. However, Aidan and his dad Pat do not get along very well. Anyway, over the past couple of months, Aidan has been spending more and more time at the house, hanging out with Alex. It's gotten to the point where Aidan has essentially become a part of the household. However, his meals, his transportation, pretty much EVERYTHING is paid for and taken care of by Alex. Alex often picks him up from school, drops him off at his girlfriend's house, etc. because Pat is always too busy. The other night, Alex and I had our friends over, and we were going out to get burritos. Pat and his wife gave us money to get them each a burrito as well, however informed Aidan that they didn't have enough money to get him one. Instead, Alex paid for it. This was kind of weird to me, and so I asked Alex about it, and he told me that this had pretty much been going on the whole summer. He thinks it's unfair, but believes he has no choice. 



   If this were a one time occurrence, it would be fine. However, Alex is already working 40 hours a week this summer trying to pay his goddamn college tuition, and really can't afford to essentially provide for another human being. The thing about Alex is that he's very non-confrontational, and really doesn't like the idea of talking to Pat about it, especially because they're not particularly close and because Pat can be very... unpleasant. Anyway, any advice on how to approach this situation would be very appreciated!

269,3dtp28,"Over the past 8 months, I've gotten to know a guy pretty well. We've become good friends, texting and skyping nearly every day. After a few months, I started to develop other feelings for him, and now that interest is interfering with my ability to enjoy our friendship.


We flirt on and off through text, and at times I'm 100% certain he's into me- but then there are days when I suddenly get no signals from him. I'd like to think that my own feelings are pretty obvious, but some guys are bad at picking up on that sort of thing and need to be hit over the head with it to realize. I've done basically everything except send him naked pictures and outright tell him. I'm not sure if he's awkward with flirting face-to-face, since he never seems to do that, or whether he's just being nice or joking. When we do flirt, it lights me up, but when I think he doesn't care, it hurts. I do not get the impression at all that he does this on purpose (I'm sure half of it is probably just in my head), and it doesn't ruin my whole day or anything, but the longer I do this, the more I realize that this emotional flip-flopping has to stop.


I would have asked him long ago how he feels except, a) I don't want to ruin everything, and b) he's about 1000 miles away and neither of us are about to move anytime soon. So, even if he does reciprocate my feelings, what would it matter? Things would basically stay the same with us, for a long time. I know this, yet somehow I still FEEL like it would matter. I still want to know, and feel like maybe it would change something. Feelings suck.


I know that the standard advice is to go no-contact, but I don't want to throw away a rewarding friendship just because of this. I know I would get over it, eventually, though it would mean a lot more space and a lot less talking. 


I want to ask how he feels about me, but I'm afraid of sounding awkward or desperate or clingy. I want to ask in an offhanded, casual way, so that it's no big deal but I doubt that's possible. I'm torn between trying to find a way to talk about it, and just trying to get a little distance and waiting until someone else I can actually be with comes along.


So I guess my question is, how do I ask casually, without it making things incredibly awkward? Is that possible? Should I just not bother in the first place?

1127,3gnsle,"So I dated a guy, let's call him Bob for 3 years. I had met him in high school, and it was a very high school-y relationship. Which was fine! and fun while it lasted.

He was kind of scatterbrained, immature, lazy, irresponsible, etc., and that's just not something I wanted for the future. In addition, he always made light of my problems and joked about some serious stuff (I had an eating disorder and was in treatment for it, and he really just did not understand or care. He told me you should eat like 700 calories a day). It was an ok relationship, but emotionally it was immature (as you can probably imagine, considering we met in high school). So I broke up with him! He took it pretty badly, and has been pretty juvenile about it and we haven't spoken since.

During that time I had been good friends with another guy. Let's call him Jim. Jim and I were friends for 6 or 7 years and we were actually good friends since before I even started dating Bob. Jim knew about most of the relationship and knew that Bob was kind of a terrible boyfriend and always supported me. Jim gave me support and love when Bob did not. 

About halfway through my 3 year relationship with Bob, I knew Jim had feelings for me. He even confessed them. I considered breaking up with Bob (and attempted to, but Bob and I talked it out) for Jim but I realized that was a very terrible and brash decision so I broke off contact with Jim for a while and returned to my relationship with Bob.

Obviously, I should have broken up with Bob LONG ago, but I was young and immature and had no clue what I was doing.

So after Bob and I broke up FOR GOOD, I began talking to Jim again A LOT. We spoke non-stop all the time and eventually I realized I had feelings for him. A month after Bob and I broke up, Jim and I began to talk seriously about dating. We were long distance, but he was making plans to move to be with me. It seemed kind of sudden and I wasn't super on-board but I knew it was Jim's decision. I tried to convince him to wait a bit, and he moved down to be with me like 3 months later.

During those 3 months I was VERY anxious. It put a lot of pressure on me, but I wanted to be with Jim and our relationship is really caring and loving. However, we're almost reaching the one year mark and I'm feeling as though I don't love him NEARLY as much as he loves me.

He lives in his own place, alone, and goes to school but has trouble making friends. I have many friends and a great support system and I love living here. I feel as though if we broke up, he would have to move back home because he does not really enjoy it here except for me.

Honestly. I would never sacrifice my career or my life to move to be with someone. I know I wouldn't do the same for him. I'm very serious about school and my job and I feel like I'm too young to be in a relationship as serious as he wants to be in.

Our relationship is very happy, very loving, and he cares about me a lot. However, I don't think it's fair that I'm letting him love me so much when the feelings are less on my end. Don't get me wrong, I do love him, but it freaks me out how much he cares about me.

So today I just got back from a long vacation (2 weeks) and during the last week, he sexted me the WHOLE TIME and only spoke about how much he missed me but to be honest I was really enjoying my vacation (I was with family) and wasn't really checking my phone as much. I feel bad that I didn't actually miss him that much.

Is there a way to speak about these feelings I'm having without destroying our relationship? I wish there was a way to make our relationship more casual again. Or would you say it's time to end it? I can't help but feel like I'm in too deep and maybe not ready for what I got myself into.

They offered it to me and I declined, of course. The next day, they came into our 3rd period and told me they had spiked our other friend (Ian)'s drink with it. Given that Ian and I weren't very close, I figured what the hell. None of my business. And from what they told me, it didn't have much of an effect on him; he just acted a little loopy. I really don't remember all the details of what they told me incredibly well.

Fast-forward to today. Senior year is just starting and Ian and I are great friends. We hang out every day, and are there for each other with whatever's going on.

99,1v2mq0,"Hello, guys. Throwaway, of course (and throwback, if you recall that Teen Girl Squad). 

This requires some background information. I dated my ex for about 8 months and we were nuts about each other. We always had so much fun together, even though we had very little in common. We were super comfortable with each other right off the bat. I can't tell you how much I cared about him. I was so happy, and I know he was, too. Well, one day, he calls me up and, whilst crying (and he's not the type to be crying), breaks up with me. I was so confused. He told me that he didn't feel like he was being fair to me in staying with me. I was devastated. He, who we will call T, is from my hometown, now I go to school in a different state. 

Well, only a few weeks after this breakup, I head home for the holidays and to a party, where I meet my current SO, K. 

It takes me no time at all to realize that K is literally everything I ever had ever looked for in a person. We start dating even though for awhile I protested, being aware that I still hadn't even began to get over T. Still, I was so nervous around him and thought he was so cute. I liked him a lot over our next dates, and eventually agreed to be his girlfriend, even though I didn't feel ready at all. I was scared of letting such a great guy get by me.

But as life would have it, T, not knowing about K, comes back into the picture, telling me how badly he messed up, how much he loves me, how he wants to make this work. I am so, so torn, as this was what I wanted to hear so badly just weeks ago, but is the last thing I want to hear now. I let him kiss me (I think a lot of this was because I was going through a very hard time and he was so familiar and was what I was used to relying on, so I caved). I have felt guilty about this ever since. K knows, though, and was understanding and forgiving.

Well, after that, I completely cut T out and focused all of my energy on K. We have now been dating for two years. We have so much in common, and everyone tells me that we've got a very meant to be vibe going on. He has never been unkind or mean or inconsiderate of me, and I know that he would marry me today if I wanted him to. We are generally very happy together, never fighting, and there is so much about him that I really, really love. He has moved to the the same state I am in now. We don't live together, but we see each other almost every day. 

But still, when I least expect it, T comes back into my mind and I miss him. He is constantly in my dreams.

What's worse, he is very close with my circle of friends back home, so every time I go home, I end up having to see him. This time, though, was the worst time. I was home for the holidays and hardly had to see him until my very last night in town, all of my friends and I went out drinking, and I ended up speaking candidly with T for the first time in ages. He tells me everything he has done to forget me, how none of it has worked, how sorry he is, how he wishes he could change everything, how he would never let me go again if he had a second chance, how he's wanted to try and get me back for a long time but didn't want to ruin my happiness. What's worse, my ride/place to sleep ended up leaving without me, so I end up having to sleep at T's house (with my other friends, not just he and I). We fall asleep together on the couch, on opposite ends, nothing physical happened at all really, but it was so hard. I just wanted to snuggle with him. I felt so guilty.

Well, now I'm back out of state, back with my boyfriend, and I feel lost and actually somewhat heartbroken. Mostly, though, I am confused, because I can't tell if this is just a stupid, typical case of wanting what you can't have, or if this has been such a long, hard journey because me and T really had something special and worth a second shot.

 I've always believed that the grass is greener where you water it, and I feel like i've only been watering my relationship with K, but T is still looking pretty green over there!

I am sorry for the length of this- I have just got to get all of this out (there really isn't anyone I can talk to about it). Any insight is appreciated, thanks.

How do you handle male friends?

My boyfriend and I have been dating just over a year and we are very happy. Both in our 30s. I have always had male best friends and he never seemed to have a problem with this. Most are busy with their lives and have gfs or wives so I don't see them much, and frankly I'm busy with my SO so if I do see them, he is with me. But I wouldn't hesitate to have coffee, a drink or dinner with any one of them if they were around. They are like brothers to me.

A situation came up recently where a male friend came into town for a month and wanted to grab a drink. I had originally met him online and we had technically went on 2 dates, although it was never physical and went nowhere. This man literally told me that he was not attracted to me and my job (same industry as him). Nonetheless, he was a nice guy and a really good contact for work. No hard feelings. When he contacted me, I slipped the boyfriend into casual conversation so he knew and there were no misunderstandings, mentioned it all to the BF just to be upfront, and proceeded to meet him for one drink in a public place where we knew a lot of people.

My boyfriend, although he agreed, was obviously uncomfortable about it when the time came and kept calling it a date. I think it just made him a little insecure, although he never said don't go. I decided myself not to see him anymore, because while I enjoy having people to hang out with (all my friends have disappeared and we are semi-long distance) and he is fun to talk work with, he's small potatoes compared to my SO. And while it in no way felt like a date, and was very innocuous...I can't imagine my mother or sister hanging out with another man alone like that.

So I sort of get that it might not be okay? But I don't know why....I've always had male friends. And I am not attracted to this man. But why is it different?

Anyways, she has had anxiety for as long as I remember, however, neither of us knew exactly what it was until about a year or two ago. She's had panic attacks since as far back as I can remember and whenever she gets set off I'll try my best to help calm her down and make her feel safe but I feel useless. 

Whenever she gets going I can't help but feel angry because it's usually over something ridiculously tiny i.e. not doing enough with the day, the day feels wasted. 

She takes these things out on me by, if we're together, constantly shooting me sad or angry looks as if it's my fault. When I pull her aside to talk about it, she says it's nothing and there's nothing I can do. It seems just like a circle of this.
When we aren't together she just constantly sends me angry texts about whatever the problem is, like not finding parking. She'll send me walls of angry text saying how the world is against her and she hates everything but there's nothing anyone can do anything about it so it just ends up her screaming at me and me trying to console her until she stops.

I know I shouldn't feel angry because she's not choosing to do this and it isn't her fault but I think my anger stems from her refusing to talk to anyone about it. 

All I want is for us to work through this and I understand that it's scary to talk to people about these things, but time and time again she promises to talk to someone with or without me and time and time again nothing comes of it.

So now, after 6 years I feel like we're in a rut. I understand at times I set her off but I feel like I do everything in my power to make her happy and she can't appreciate it because her anxiety makes her angry about something and that's the end of any happiness in the day.

I feel awful feeling angry about any of this for obvious reasons so I can't really talk to anyone else about it. I hate that I feel she's too immature about some things like not finding parking. These are such minuscule problems that I can't believe any energy is going towards because I have such larger problems like money and school and work.
In the end, I don't know what else to do. She's acknowledged that she takes it out on me and she's sorry but it doesn't stop. These attacks seem to come in spurts (every night for a week, none for a week, repeat). I'm in a rut. I love her but it scares me to think that all of this has started to degrade our relationship. After so long, I don't know what to do.

Thank you for letting me get this off my chest and would greatly appreciate any and all advice. I'm sorry if I didn't have much order or the right kind of details, this is my first time on this subreddit. Thank you.

I've been living in Paris for a few years and became great friends with a group of girls who were interning at the place where I work (let's call them Ellen, Harriet and Lollie). For the year they were placed, we went out together, cooked together, had dramas, cried, laughed, and generally had an amazing friendship. We were so on the same page, we all complemented each others ways of life, personalities, etc...

So when their year was up they left to go back home and we all cried a lot. We vowed to keep flying over to see each when we could. Harriet followed through by visiting just a few months later. Lollie actually moved to a nearby city after a while, and Ellen and I (still living in Paris) were excited she was going to be just an hour on the train away.

Next thing I know, on facebook there's a photo of Lollie, Ellen and Harriet in Lollie's new city. To manage to get all these girls in the same place at the same time is quite a feat since everyone' international, and they were gushing about how nice it was to be back together again.

I'm crushed. It's like they completely forgot I exist. I've kept in touch with them since they left so it's not like we were no contact... I really thought we were kind of a foursome, but maybe that's not the case...

I mentioned it to Harriet and she was like, Lol sry forgot never mind. But Ellen travelled to see them from the same city I live in, so it's not like I was somewhere else, or too far away... And none of them said a thing beforehand.

Just recently I've moved to a city very close to Lollie's and I've invited her over for dinner (I'm excited to show her my new apartment!). Her answer is always a version of If you're in my city, let me know!. It would take her 20 minutes on the train to get to mine, and I live 5 minutes walk from the station, but she says she doesn't feel like going to my city. Like, no reason, just she doesn't want to. (My city isn't unsafe or anything, it's beautiful and awesome just like hers).

Of course, the minute I'm in her city I'll give her a call and try to meet up, but I feel like I'm only her friend if it's convenient for her? 

I don't know, the whole thing with these girls is just making me feel really sad, like I'm super forgettable and not worth a 20 minute train journey. And it's hurting me because these girls are genuinely lovely people, so I just can't wrap my head around why they're being like this.

791,2e095g,"To preface, we've been together just over 9 years and she's the love of my life.  We were recently married in June and closed on our first house last month.  

I am definitely more impulsive and I know that that can be a fault at times.  She's far more calculated in her decision-making and for that I respect her.  I've also tried to adapt some of her traits since I feel that, overall, being slower to make bigger decisions can be beneficial in the long run.

That said, I've wanted a dog for a few years now.  The obvious hurdle for a while was that we lived in an apartment and both felt that it'd be unfair to ourselves and the dog to take on such a responsibility in a smaller space.  The deal was that whenever we found a house that would be when a dog would enter the picture. 

When we got married she told me my wedding gift would be a dog.  The caveat was still that we had to find a home.  I was thrilled and, as luck would have it, the perfect house came our way after a long time looking.  

We've both wanted a rescue and today the perfect opportunity arose.  I've wanted a puggle for some time and, as luck would have it, a puggle was up for adoption at the local animal shelter.  We both went and handled the dog, I fell in love with him, she really seemed to like him, and we agreed that we'd think about it. 

Well, unluckily for us, we weren't the only ones there for this dog.  I inquire about the animal and another couple is waiting behind us ready to buy the dog if we say yay or nay.   

I look to my wife and I can see the doubt creeping on her face.  I get it, it's a huge commitment, but I truly felt the cards had fallen in our favor since the odds of finding a healthy, young puggle in a shelter seems to be quite low.   The dog met all that I wanted when I was describing to her the dog I was looking for and as we stood at the window I was hoping that she'd say something to reinforce that she was on board with this decision.

Instead, I got general indecision and a lot of what-ifs.  The what-ifs had been stuff we'd discussed (potty-training for instance) so at that point, pretty confident that my wife was just grasping for reasons to not get the dog, I told the other couple that they could have him.  

I'm frustrated for a few reasons.  Though I'm a fan of her more calculated mentality, I feel there *are* times when you just have to go for it.  Since we'd been talking about a dog for *years* I didn't feel this was so much of an impulse and should have been something that we could have agreed upon in a shorter time frame. 

I'm also, I guess, a bit upset because I felt like for once this was something that I *really* wanted and hoped that my wife would have jumped on board.  That may be childish, but I've done my research and I'm not going into owning a dog with reckless abandon.  I felt that my wants were pretty narrow and the fact that the local shelter had something that met those criteria absolutely thrilled me.

We didn't get in a shouting match but I did express a lot of frustration.  I feel that there are times when you do need to make a quick decision and I've felt that we've planned for a dog long enough that it wasn't an impulsive let's go check out dogs today kind of thing.

I'm trying to figure out a way of working through this without being too frustrated.   During the house-buying process she was very much the same and often took days to make a large decision.  In a market where things can quickly come and go it became a detriment and I ended up really handling a good portion of the process. 

It just really frustrates me.  I'd like to sort of get some advice and maybe some folks can point out some things I could do to better understand her.  I feel like there's some resistance to these things that don't surface until we're on the cusp of making the decision.  Am I being selfish?  Is she?  Are we both?

1073,2zcfcn,"I think he loves me, and I'm definitely falling for him. But because of his need to draw this big, thick line between men and women, and my unrelenting demand to erase this line, as things are there's no future with this guy. He's moving away in 3 months and I won't do long distance with someone I don't have a future with. Should I tell him it's doomed now, or enjoy the next 3 months and let him know I don't want long distance right before he moves? 



Why tell him now: First off, fairness--the guy has a right to know there's a count down happening. Secondly, he'll have a chance to salvage the situation, he if wants. I know gender roles are so ingrained that it's pretty much impossible to change. But against logic, there's a part of me that wishes he would just show me a sign he's willing to at least hear my perspective. I love this guy enough that I'll respect where he's coming from even on this issue and keep an open mind (after all, I do love cooking for him; I melt with happiness when I see him enjoy my food; I just don't love that I SHOULD cook because I'm a woman) , if only he'll do the same for me. He's so attentive to my needs and values me a lot. We're so in synch; together it's always joyful and easy and very meaningful. If he knew that this is what's dooming our relationship, maybe he'll be willing to at least discuss and think about the issue? Right now he just changes the subject when I bring up maternity leave or women's advancement in the work place, and that's what kills me. I'm not asking him to do a 180, just to be open to my perspective. 



Why wait three months: A more explicit warning would sound like an ultimatum, and I'm not forcing or expecting him to change. I've never actually promised we'll definitely do long distance. I think this is not something that he naturally assumes will happen. I've already told him that the gender issue would be a deal breaker for me. He just pulled away and was distance that night, then changed the subject when I brought it up again the next day. 


Details about our relationship and the problem, which can be skipped/skimmed: 


He's never come to see me without flowers or chocolate or a little gift of some kind. He always holds the door for me. I almost have to physically fight him to pay for something. Oh and he's very attractive and the sex is bomb (obviously, he's attentive and respectful and loving in bed).


All this is nice, but it's because he's a really old school guy, which makes him a true gentleman as described above, but he also embraces racial and gender stereotypes pretty hard. For example, on Halloween he said that he saw an small Asian guy wearing a superman costume and that looked wrong because we all know superman is white. I am Asian, and he doesn't see how it would offend me to suggest that Asian men cannot embody everything that Superman stands for. 


He's the same way with gender stereotypes. But it's worse because, whereas he'll at least watch how he phrases his racial stereotypes (e.g. back paddling out of the Asian superman situation by saying it was the guy's stature, not his race), blatant men vs. women statements are more socially acceptable. That's an aggressive lady and she's bossy and sometime I can almost talk to her like a guy and your typical men are insert stereotype here and women are insert stereotype here. He doesn't think women belong ONLY in the kitchen (he's very supportive of my career aspirations), but cooking and child care are definitely her realm. When we say let's cook instead of eating out, he naturally waits for me to grab a pan and asks me how he can help ME cook and help ME do the dishes. He'll say things like I don't like drinking out of straws because I'm a man and I'm not supposed to suck on things. I don't like to put in contacts because I'm a man and I don't like things being inserted inside of me. I just laughed at the time, but seriously? 



I know a lot of people buy into traditional gender roles here, and the flowers and chocolates like a dream come true a lot of women, but not for me. It's weird if I buy him little gifts to show affection, but it's great if I cook something (men pay, women cook). There are certain subjects he'll only discuss with the boys and save more polite subjects to be discuss with his girlfriend. These sound like trivial things, but to me they highlight the underlying view that men and women are fundamentally different and I can't live with that. I'd trade all the flowers and chocolates in the world to be viewed as a true equal. 



One of the main themes of my life is actively rejecting gender roles. I insist on paying for half of everything in relationships. I speak up when I object to something. I refuse to apologize by default whenever there is a conflict. I refuse to cook and clean at Thanksgiving while my male family members watched football. I wore a tie to my business school presentations as a symbol of my demand to be treated and viewed as an equal. When someone suggests nicely that something is not fitting for women, that person is not going to be a close friend. 



I respect that he's coming from a point of view that is backed up by tradition and social norms. I appreciate so much that he's trying (and succeeding) to be the best person he can, and the best partner, according to what he thinks is right. I'm not expecting him to change immediately, and he's not so sexist that we can't come to a compromise eventually if we end up living together. But he needs be open minded to why I hate being told to act a certain way because I'm a women, and right now he so completely is not, so it's basically over for me.

At the start of our relationship, I had recently ended a four year relationship a couple months before but had continued hooking up with my ex until about a month before my current relationship began. 

I brought way too much baggage from my previous relationship into my current one:

* A couple weeks into current relationship, my ex called with news that her friend had just died. She said she felt so depressed that she couldn't make it through the night. I stayed with her that night. Nothing sexual or romantic happened. But my gf still obviously did not like it, and has felt hurt by it ever since.
* I stayed in touch with my ex for the first few months because we both wanted to stay friends. However, I ended this after I realized she still had feelings for me. 
* Since I was recently out of my previous relationship, I talked about it/her way too much. I insensitively compared my gf to my ex in terms of personality, looks, and even sex. (My gf is better in every category, but I continued to compare and overshare thinking she would appreciate winning the comparison. In reality, she hated that the comparison was taking place at all. Looking back, I would have too.)
* I stayed in touch with my ex longer than my gf knew. At our one year mark, right before we moved in together, I came clean and told my gf this truth. I also confessed just how little time had existed between the two relationships. So despite spending a generally great first year together, our second year (and first month living together) started on a terrible note. She felt like she couldn't trust me anymore, and our relationship has been rocky ever since. We are struggling about 2/3 of the time, and never seem to make it through a week on good terms. 

I don't have the emotional skills to help cure these hurts that I caused over two years ago, but my gf is frequently reminded of them during her day, and she's still very upset and untrusting because of what I did. She needs to understand what happened before she can trust me again. I can't explain due to embarassment at my actions and lack of skill at explaining.

36,1txmau,"I've been dating my boyfriend for about six months now. This is the longest any relationship has ever lasted for me and I have no idea what I am doing. I'm not good at relationships in general, though I try to be giving and thoughtful. I'm also extremely depressed due to life circumstances. But right now, he is more or less the only person I have in my life who cares about me, and it doesn't even feel like that.
 
- We're both broke grad students so I only see him once a week, and we don't really go out. We text in between then, but it's very distant-seeming and he almost always disappears in the middle of conversations or doesn't answer texts for days. In person he's always affectionate and caring, maybe even overly so, but the rest of the time we might as well not be in a relationship, and when I really miss him or need someone to talk to it's like he doesn't exist. The latest example is New Year's. He made other plans, and I just found out. I don't have any other plans because I figured I'd be spending it with him, because he's my boyfriend. This means I'm going to be completely alone on New Year's, and the thought of it makes me miserable. 

- We haven't had sex in months. There is still physical affection and whatnot, but the relationship right now is completely sexless. Most of this is on his part, as he has a fairly low sex drive and ED. But it is extremely depressing for me. I wouldn't cheat but I find myself fantasizing about other people, just so I could imagine that I could ever get laid. There are certain fantasies/kinks (nothing extreme) that I have that I don't think I'll ever be able to do anything about, because it's impossible to even have sex, even though I'm in a relationship. This doesn't seem fair, but if he can't even get an erection there is nothing I can do about it.

- The worst part about this, or at least the most confusing part, is that I feel like he is attached to me a lot more than I am attached to him. (All of the above can be interpreted as him cheating on me, but given his personality and life situation it'd be incredibly impressive for him to pull off. Like, I would be actually impressed more than I would be angry. I'm imagining him cheating on me and I just can't care at all, it would even seem like a relief.) I fantasize about being in relationships with other people all the time. Sometimes exes (it'd never work, I actually went out platonically with an ex last month and all I could think about was how annoying his voice was and how terrible his beard was and basically everything that bugged me the first time around), sometimes random people I admire, sometimes just people on the street. 

- The bottom line, I guess, is that I don't think I'll ever fall in love with him and I can't see this lasting forever and am not sure I even want it to. But I don't want to break up, because I literally do not have anyone else in my life, I'm not attractive enough to have many opportunities for relationships, I don't meet many people anyway, and being in a relationship makes my life objectively better, even though it doesn't make it better all the time like it should. It's like I have all the downsides at once: feeling lonely in that paradoxical way where he cares about me more than I care about him, but also feeling lonely in the way you would where you're single, where you wish you had someone who cared about you at all.

690,2xngfi,"My friends Sam is a music artist here in my country. He has been doing music since 2011, but early 2013, things really started taking off for him, and he was able to quit his job and live off touring/promotional money comfortably. I knew him in high school, and although he moved away, every time I travelled to his new city (about three times a year), he would invite me to stay with him and his apartment he shared with his girlfriend at the time (he is now single). He always told me that I didn't belong in our home city, that I was like him, and that I needed to ‘get out’, and in early 2014 (about a year ago to the day!) I decided to move. We both love our home city, but we definitely both fit in better here.


To give you some background on Sam, he is an exceptionally charismatic, hard working and passionate person. He also happens to be quite attractive, which i'm sure adds to the legion of fans he has, that stop him in the street wherever he goes. He is incredibly humble and deserves all the recognition for his work. To make it clear.. he is not in a band- he IS the band. He is the face, the voice- everything. 


With fame, has come paranoia. He has a certain number of friends in this city, and he has gained nil more over the years since moving here, in fear that everyone he meets is just being friendly because they want to be close to his brand rather than Sam as a human being. He is still incredibly receptive and kind to everyone, talking candidly to whoever speaks with him, but behind closed doors, he spends a lot of time by himself or with his housemates. 


When I first moved here, I knew he would be busy recording his album, so I did not interfere or bother him to hang out for a couple of months. It was two months until I saw him. He had been spending every night in the studio, and as we were on different schedules (I'd wake up early to go to work, come home and go to bed at night) he would wake up around midday, and be doing his work until early in the morning. I was a bit bummed that I never got to see him because I did not know anyone aside from him and his girlfriend in the city at the time. I felt forgotten almost, but I removed this thought from my mind, as I knew he was committed to his creating. A few months later his album dropped, and he toured even more. He has received even more attention, and throughout the second half of last year, I only managed to see him a handful of times. 


Fast forward to today. He is still so difficult to catch up with. His housemates and him are in a scene in this city I am not involved in. We all get along, but I am not like them at all. Sam and I, I guess on average, hang out once every two months. That generally consists of going to dinner or a gig together. We always have a terrific time and he is comfortable speaking with me because we come from the same place and, I guess, there's that familiarity there. I knew him before he was famous so he isn't concerned that I'm faking our friendship.


My concern is reddit, how do I ask to see him more? Or how do I tell him that I feel as though I am behaving like a good friend to him, but he is not fitting of the definition towards me? everytime he drops a new track I’ll text him congrats/my thoughts on it, I go to every one of his gigs, I come to him and his housemates parties, I send him music I like for inspiration to him (his genre is quite limited, so he comes to me for stuff outside the box so he doesn’t go crazy). I want to be able to sit down and tell him how I feel as though he doesn't stay in contact with me / seem to be involved in what I do. I am super supportive of him, and he to me when we ARE hanging out, but quite often things of mine I'll invite him to (I just realeased a street magazine and had a launch) he totally forgets to come to. There is no follow up text to aknowledge or apologise, either. He simply is terrible at organising things, and doesn't keep to times. He has been like this forever, and it’s only because he has a manager/tour managers that he is able to get to shows on time, I’m pretty sure. 


I do read this and think, wait, maybe he just doesn’t like me? But we’ve been friends for years and always have such a fun time together, we talk in-depth about a lot of things like great friends do, and he looks after me when we are out drinking like I’m his little sister (things have never been romantic with us, and they never will be) so I KNOW he cares, I guess I just want to see it more.


I just want to see him!! Should I give up? Or keep trying? I feel really defeated, because he is a great guy, but it’s almost embarrassing at this point, knowing that I have to text him to receive any contact. What should I do?

294,2x7fw4,"One of my best friends since childhood (Jessica) and her mom (Karen) called me this past Saturday. Jessica is breaking up with her boyfriend of 4+ years, quitting her job, and moving to Los Angeles on a whim (she lives in Chicago). Karen asked if I would be able to accompany Jessica to drive to Los Angeles with her on Thursday (tomorrow). Karen offered to pay for everything - she'll pay for gas, food, hotels, AND my flight home from LA. I was really hesitant. Jessica has pretty severe, uncontrolled ADHD and has a hard time focusing and I don't really consider her responsible, I guess. I wasn't sure if I'd be okay with driving 2,000 miles cross-country with someone I can't really trust to pay attention in the car. But Karen assured me that they mapped out the route and we'll go south (so through Oklahoma City, Amarillo TX, Albuquerque NM and Flagstaff AZ) and that the weather will be fine and it'll be a smooth ride. I only work 3 days a week and actually had a 7 day stretch off of work, so I gave it some thought and agreed.

Jessica and I have been talking about it for the past few days and I've gotten really excited about it! We mapped out all of our stops, planned to see a few sights along the way, planned out what we'll do once we get to LA, etc. etc. I've been pretty excited. Karen and her husband booked my flight to Chicago from LA for Monday, Jessica got her car all checked up, we were basically set! 

So now, it's the night before our trip. It's been snowing like crazy in Chicago all day. I drove from Milwaukee to Chicago tonight and my usual 90 min trip took me nearly 3 hours due to the snow. It's supposed to snow all throughout Illinois tomorrow, which is like 6 hours of our commute. I've been following the weather and am now seeing severe winter storm warnings for all of the cities we need to drive through on all the days we'd be driving through them (notably ALL of Illinois tomorrow, Amarillo and Albuquerque on Friday and Flagstaff on Saturday). I've heard these winter storms have been terrible lately, and I'm already freaked out by how awful my commute was from MKE to Chicago today. I already was skeptical about Jessica's driving… and I just don't think I trust her (or even myself) to navigate these snow storms. It's unsafe and all the weather alerts have advised against travel and I'm just not comfortable with it. I've heard about highway closures near Flagstaff and severe accidents in Amarillo so far this winter, and it just freaks me out.

I called Jessica tonight and told her I don't think it's a good idea. She's super resistant and trying to talk me into it… and understandably. She's gone through a lot this week - quit her job, dumped her boyfriend, packed up her house, and is now living with her grandma. But I just don't think I can do it. I'd be a nervous wreck and feel super unsafe the whole time. I'd never forgive myself if something happened. She also doesn't even have a job or anywhere to live in LA yet - so it's not like she's in a rush to get there to get started at work or anything.

735,1mfgdf,"Not sure where to start. I'm still hungover from last nights shutdown, trying to get my bearings. Throwaway for reasons. Here goes nothing:


Broke up with my gf of three years. Relationship was dead for the last third year, I just couldn't bring myself up to break up until the end of spring. This is a REALLY long story, as of why i broke up etc, so to shorten it up:


I registered myself on a dating site. Talked to a girl (well, ugh, woman more like it) for a good month, we've had a blast, talking was easy, so we decided to meet up. Three dates on, we end up in bed, and thats where whole intimacy part kicks off. Everything was perfectly fine for a good month. See, she has a kid (10), whom she has a shared custody thing going with his biological dad. He's with her every other week. So we dated on those off weeks. Already then I was kinda yeah, ok, kinda hard putting my feelings to a fullstop every other week, but w/e, she's fantastic, it's worth it. 


One of the important parts in this story is the fact that she claimed that she's very...picky and carefull about who she lets to meet the kid and how fast it happens. I figured yeah, makes perfect sence, I'm in no rush, I get it. Fast forward a month or so, I'm already at the sideline of my first soccer match that I watched. Her kid was playing. I met his bio father and his gf, a few friends of my gf's and of course The Kid. Cute kid. Reminds me a fuckton about myself his age, so I kinda can relate.


Commense brainfuck: She's a single mom, been studying for 8-9 years, and is finishing up her PhD degree in a months time. After a chat I've had with her yesterday, I found out that she's been putting off her PhD work to be with me. I was entirely oblivious to this because I figured she's a grown-up and has full control over whats up. What shut me down from the heavens up high down to scorched earth was this: She's in deep shit with her PhD work, falling behind (from what I understand, take this with a grain of salt) by almost a half-a-year/a year and she'll be doing crazy 12 hour sessions 7 days a week to try to pull it off. She is stressed out of her mind, and due to this (according to her) she does not really have the time for me. She is also not sure about the relationship because she thinks that I'm too caring, I care too much about people, and am overly protective, while she is more of a cold person and just lets things happen without much worry in mind. Reason for this remark was me noticing another mom with a kid in the back seat talking in the phone without hands-free, and I said that it was irresponsible (My gf claims though, that it's mother's choice, therefore it's fine).


If you think that this post does not make much sence, you're in the same boat as I am. I have bits and pieces that don't really warrant a break-up right off the bat, and I can't glue it all together to make sence of it, hence this post. I need help de-layering this thing and analyze it, and if I'm lucky come to some sort of conclusion. 


The result of this talk we had last night was this:


- I let her go. I suggested radio silence unless she texts me first.
- We wount see each other untill atleast early november when she hands over the degree. Doing this and the above maximises her focus on task at hand.
- We'll re-evaluate our relationship at early november. She told me she wasn't sure what she wanted, and partially blamed PhD-stress for not knowing what she wants right now. She's been single mom for 10 years, and been single-single for 5 of those years. She's even had thoughts of the possibility that she might not find anyone, ever, and just carry on being single for the rest of her life. She's 100% independant.
- Full halt untill early november.


What I don't understand is this:


-Why the sudden cold shoulder?
-Why did I meet the kid this early if she senced that I might not be what she was looking for?
-Why all the compliments at how such a good person I am, how careing I am (obviously counts as positive all of the sudden?)
-Why did we have a talk about going up to her parents for christmas, just 4 days prior to this talk?

176,1oc7hy,"My roommate and I are juniors and have been close all through college. She has a long history with Ben, a guy from her hometown who attends a different university. They discussed dating our freshman year, but he decided he couldn't handle an LDR. He soon after began dating a local girl who had a crush on him and they've been together almost 2 yrs now. Problem is, roomie's still in love with Ben. She's convinced that he is the only person who understands her or cares about her in the least and that talking to him is the only method of cheering her up. They both text each other literally nonstop. She actually experiences physical symptoms when he's extremely stressed or excited. I have no idea how his girlfriend is okay with any of it. It would not surprise me if they both moved back home and started dating after grad school in 5 years, but I need advice for dealing with her until at least the end of this year. 

Knowing that she hasn't moved on in the slightest, I've occasionally convinced her to try no contact both by gentle pressure and by rudely pointing out that he's using her for emotional comfort while sleeping with someone else. During NC periods, she ends up using me as her sole vent and needs constant attention I can't afford to give, before insisting that I just don't get it and telling me she wishes she could talk to Ben. I bite my tongue and tell myself she's healing, but get frustrated and resentful when she inevitably resumes communication with him. When she and Ben are communicating, life is outwardly alright for me; it bothers me how unhealthy it is for her, but I try to stay quiet because she requires much less of my time and she shoots my opinions on the subject down anyway. Eventually something (a snide comment from a friend, me starting a new relationship, a heartfelt fb post between Ben and his gf, etc.) causes her to break down. Unable to ignore her, I then point out that she's waiting around for Ben, encourage her to go NC, and the cycle starts over. It's getting to the point that I avoid being home. Recently she's begun arguing that if she's sad, it self-promoting by doing whatever will make her happy---texting him.

149,246x9n,"For almost 6 months, me and my SO have grown to become best friends; it's been fantastic. Sex all the time, rarely any arguments and when we do have them they pass quickly and have no lasting effect, we hang out all the time playing video games, doing the dirty, writing poetry, singing together... It has been the best relationship of my life.

Let me tell you a little about him. He sings me to sleep every night; he surprises me with gifts and takes me on dates eating pizza lakeside and then takes me home for sexy time and video games. He is the sweetest man I've ever dated. He always puts me first, and genuinely cares for me very much. I was previously dating a married man who constantly put me down and emotionally abused me, and my current SO is very understanding of that and is trying to help me heal.

Well, when I was younger I had a lot of issues with my dad when I was younger. The majority of that I keep to myself, but my SO knows that something happened. There are just certain details that I don't want to talk about, especially not yet. I told my SO at the beginning of the relationship that I wouldn't be able to tell him certain things.

I was feeling very down yesterday and I cried for a long time to him. Well, he basically started accusing my dad of being the cause to my depression and got really upset that I wouldn't tell him what my dad used to do to me. It's been almost ten years, and I told him that it wasn't why I was sad all the time. My dad is a really great guy now.

It was really late so I headed home, but we talked on the phone during my drive. Things escalated, starting with him accusing my dad again and our voices started raising and he ended up screaming at me about how he wanted to hit my dad just because he was assuming the worst about him since I wouldn't tell him. He sounded so awful. He didn't even sound like himself.

The screaming scared me and triggered a panic attack, so I quickly hung up. He called back and was angry still but in a level tone; then he started raising his voice again and I started bawling and begged him to stop. Then he started crying, and kept apologizing and telling me he didn't know what came over him. He felt horrible about it.

Some part of me feels like I triggered the yelling. Like it was my fault. I know it's probably just my past talking, but maybe it's true. Is it wrong for me to keep things from him like the things my dad used to do to me? I feel like it's my business, and I can tell him when I want.

I can't get his voice out of my head. I keep reliving it. I haven't been yelled at in a long time. His voice just keeps running through my mind over and over. I have been crying off and on all day. I had nightmares all night. I feel terrible. I can't stop hearing it. It hurts every time.

He feels really bad about it, which makes me feel worse. I made him angry enough to yell, and now he feels bad about it. He keeps telling me it was his fault and he is so sorry and he can't stop thinking about it, but it doesn't make me feel better. I just keep thinking about how things will be in a few years. I feel like he only stopped yelling because I started crying; what happens when he gets used to me crying? Do things get worse?

I'm just so worried. I love him very much but I feel scared of him right now. It has only been one day so maybe the way I feel will change, but I really need advice. I don't know what to do. I don't want to break up with him, but I do not want to stick around in a relationship that is going to escalate to something worse, or even stay consistent with what happened last night.

I don't know why I feel scared, honestly. It was just yelling, and it wasn't even in person. Maybe it's ridiculous to even feel upset about it. It was just so shocking. I haven't felt this way since my dad used to yell at me, but I know that sounds melodramatic. I keep trying to convince myself that everyone yells sometimes when they don't mean to.

What now? Do I stick around? Will things get worse? Should I even feel so bad for being yelled at? Is this my fault?

188,37mgc4,"I've always known my father as a healthy, self sustaining, confident, self-less and humorous man.  He has never been married though, and he and my mom split up when I was 3 (though they have been friends since my childhood).

He has always been there for me and does absolutely anything for me.

I lived with him off and on after age 20, just because of my own personal situations.  However I found a great job where I can live on my own and fully support myself.  The only problem it created for me is that I now live 2 hours away from him.  Not terribly far, but we aren't able to hang out as often as we did.

Cutting to the situation:  Dad has been with his current girlfriend for about 8 years now.  He bought a big house to comfortably suit them as well as her three kids. 

I'll be straight about it, I have never been too fond of her, mainly because of the way she is socially.  Borderline alcoholic, terrible with money, always out with coworkers and boss, and among other reasons.  It's hard of me to say because she's always been good to me, and even kick started my career by getting me an IT job where she works that has now landed me at a great company in an awesome area. I truly appreciate her for that and have shown it, but the leg that supports my feelings for her has been kicked out from under it lately and that's due to how she has been treating my dad.

He had a stroke last year.  He has suffered from diabetes since his diagnosis at 17, and now kidney disease.  He has high blood pressure issues as well.  It was an excruciating time for me seeing him incoherent in the hospital for weeks.  He worked hard in construction his whole life, always had fast cars and motorcycles.  And now he's reduced to being on a couch all day, dialysis three times a week, and having a household that doesn't respect him.

Dad's girlfriend just doesn't get it.  Early February while my dad was in his room vomiting and in pain (a mere month after the stroke), she threw a Super Bowl Party... it blew my mind to see her completely disregard any concern for his well being and top it off with a noisy party.  Dad has no problem with her having fun, it's just the fact that she did so where he was trying to rest.

Here's the thing.  She has this image of loving and caring of him, but my dad said she's constantly running around with friends from work including her boss, and during this time she drinks and spends a lot of money.  My dad has suspected her of sleeping with him, and I don't blame him.  When I worked with her, she and her coworkers practically worship this man.  He's friendly and supportive of us, but it is very strange her demeanor around him.  To put it in more perspective, the relationship is fishy enough that his own wife does not feel comfortable about it either.  Aside from that, she constantly talks about her ex husband (with whom she's had all three of her kids with, married for 20 years or so).  My dad is cool with light conversation about him namely because it's her boys' father, but he sees a higher regard for him than an ex wife in a long term relationship should have.  My dad takes good care of her, and her kids (now 18, 20, and 22).  Ultimately, even if she really isn't messing around, it's still really upsetting that my dad is not the number 1 man in her life.

My dad puts his foot down around the house and displays authority, he's not sulking in how his girlfriend treats him, and he makes it clear to her how he feels about it everything.   As far as her boys, It causes problems between them when he mentions they need to help more with duties/chores etc.  One of the boys left for the military, but the oldest lives at the house now with his girlfriend.  She's rude, takes advantage of the son she's with, pays a little rent but does nothing to help with the household.  

So his dilemma is that he loves his girlfriend, but does not feel he's a priority in her life despite how much he does for her..  He told me today he's at a point where he's emotionally unable to care about it anymore and just needs to figure out a way to get back on his feet.

Every time I talk to him he sounds so tired.  He's been switching forms of dialysis because one made him feel incredibly weak and dizzy, but the other that makes him feel better requires 3 days a week, 6 hours a day each which is really time consuming for him.

I never know what to say when I talk to him about this stuff.  I sympathize, tell him I love him, tell him to hang in there and that if he ever needs anything I'd be there immediately.  I always distract him with jokes and it's always relieving to hear him laugh.

What sucks is that I just want him to be persistently happy but I have little control over any of the situation.  He's such a good man who really goes out of his way for other people, and now he's struggling to support himself, and is disrespected and of little priority to those who he takes good care of.  He is down to just wanting to at least relieve the stress of the trouble of taking care of himself, and then will most likely leave his girlfriend.  He's very fair in it all.  The house is in his name but she pays half the mortgage and will give her what she's paid into it back as well as a proportionate equity from her contribution.  Her possible infidelity is not of concern to his happiness anymore.  He said he loves her but that it's inevitable they will break up in due time for a number of reasons.

She's aware of the crumbling relationship.  The real issue I have is how to help him find a way to be happy again.  He wants to return to work and become independent, and it would be wonderful to see him find a woman who can reciprocate love and care.

The last part of all this, I'm worried that if/when he does return to work, he will be driving a lot, still dealing with dialysis, and I will constantly worry about his health and other risks constantly.  He has good judgement though, and I don't see this as him being stubborn. Not to any dangerous degree at least.

It's a lot on me.  And I just want to find some way to make his life less difficult.  I thank you for reading all this and for any advice.

**tl;dr**: Dad had a stroke and is struggling to be self sustaining.  Girlfriend and her kids don't respect him despite providing so much for them.  He is distressed, in pain, and I live hours away from him.  He knows their relationship will end, but he is physically unable to take care of himself right now.  Every time I talk to him I don't know what I can possibly do to make his life manageable.  He's in strong spirits, still laughs and jokes, but is in pain and it is taking a toll on me to know he is not as happy as he should be.

Looking for any advice at all on what I can do.

913,1qvauk,"For the past year or two, I have been working on a number of volunteer projects in my area, and, as I live in a small town, there has been a lot of overlap as far as people involved in working on each project. I've become friends with a lot of them in a variety of different contexts and professional roles. (I'm usually the youngest person involved, at least in any kind of administrative capacity.)

Anyway, one of the people I became friends with during this process has a daughter. Earlier this year, I was working for/with him on one of these projects for maybe four months, and this basically consisted of us spending every weekend working together. Usually there would be a few other people who showed up, but we were the only two people involved every single weekend, so we became good friends pretty quickly. In the last week or two of the project, he introduced me to his family – wife and daughter – and they joined us as well. I've never become friends with people more quickly. We all spent quite a bit of time together at that point, and bonded over the shared work and a bunch of other stuff. Most of that time, the four of us were working, at his direction, in independent pairs: me &amp; daughter, husband &amp; wife.

Immediately, his daughter (henceforth M) and I got along incredibly well. I've never clicked with someone so quickly: literally within 15 minutes of meeting the first time, we were finishing sentences in unison and laughing uproariously the whole time. I'm usually very shy and have never had the speaking-in-unison thing happen before, even with people I've known for years. 

The first 3-4 days that M and I were in each other's company, we were mostly also in her parents' company, and we were just as happily, and just as freely, chatting whether or not her parents were there (when they were, they would be participating too as often as not). At one point all 4 of us were driving somewhere and a discussion of music turned into a 4-person chorus (complete with improvised 2-part harmony). When we (whichever combination of M, her parents, and me it was at any given moment) were working together, it was smooth and enjoyable all around. When we went to a lake to relax after working, her parents happily did their own thing while were swimming and wandering around and whatnot on our own. Point being that we got along really well, and that her parents were cognizant of everything going on.

Initially, M and I were all focused on the project at hand, so even though we were getting to know each other and talking a lot, I didn't learn until a fair while after I had begun to get excited about the whole experience that she was actually still in high school. She did seem to be younger than me, but I would not have ever guessed – by behavior or appearance or anything else – that she was *7 years* younger than me.

Since the end of the project, M and I have kept in touch mostly by text, but two weeks ago we spent an evening together that felt like it could have been a date, and we have tentative plans to hang out next week. Nothing romantic has ever happened between us, but our social chemistry is pretty obvious, and there seems to be a pretty strong current of mutual attraction.

(While all of that has happened, I have continued to work with her dad on other projects, and he knows that we are still friends independently; we haven't specifically talked about my friendship with M, but he hasn't expressed, or appeared to have, any kind of problem with it, and he and I are just as friendly as ever.)

I don't know what – if anything – will happen next with us, but I'm hoping to read some outside opinions about what is and isn't appropriate in this context. Obviously, I really like this girl, and if there is a potential relationship here, I don't want to miss the opportunity – but I understand that our age gap is not tiny, and even more than I'd like to explore the possibility, I really don’t want to do anything with the potential to be inappropriate or accidentally hurtful or bad in whatever way. So, Reddit, tell me what you think!

Context:
So about 5 years ago, I met this girl, let's call her Lady Luck (K-Drama reference, anyone?). She was shy,awkward, and had a huge crush on me. Now, I was in another relationship and was infatuated by, lets call her Girl2. Now, I started dating Girl2 around the time Lady Luck started liking me, so of course that was a problem for Lady Luck. Anyways, after about 2 months of staying with Girl2, I become good friends with Lady Luck and eventually find out she actually really likes me. Like she wrote poems about me and actually really liked me. Now, Girl2 was insanely abusive(not physically!) to me and a overall bad girlfriend, but I stayed with her because well, I was stupid. Lady Luck however, was kind and gentle. Anyways after a bit of drama, which involved Girl2 cursing out Lady Luck and me eventually telling Lady Luck to stop liking me (I will forever feel like an asshole for this, I was hypnotized by Girl2 ok T-T), where then Lady Luck started cried, Lady Luck and I stopped talking. Meanwhile, Girl2 cheated on me about 3 times and we eventually broke up. That was 4 years ago.

2 Years later, me and Lady Luck have started talking. We get closer and closer, start hanging out, and one day she came over to my house. We hung out for 2 hours and during the end I thought What the hell am I doing, I like her. and I kissed her (Both of our first kiss, haaaah romantic? Or just me being a lil wuss? Shut up.). After that, we started going out for about 5 months and those 5 months were surprisingly hard. She was constantly busy, and put everything above me after we got together. I was on the bottom of her list of important things, and eventually because of this, we broke up because she was too busy and I was, to be frank, too needy (what can you expect, I was basically ignored). So we break up and we don't talk for awhile.

So during the next 2 years we talk on and off, and we start liking each other but then we stop talking because she just doesn't flat-out want to be in a relationship because she's too busy. My childhood friend told me that It doesn't matter if one person is busy, if you truly like someone, you should try your hardest for THEM! Although I agree with this 100%, I understand Lady Luck's situation. This happened 3 times by the way (Insanity!).

Mein Kampf (My struggle)*:
Fast Forward another two years. It's my birthday! Cool, yeah, I'm getting old (cry). I get a message from Lady Luck. That message turns into a conversation, and that conversation turns into a date. I seem to still have feelings for her. So we talk more and more and eventually we start talking about each others feelings (god I'm such a wuss). Lady Luck said how she still liked me and thought I was amazing and such, but didn't want to be in relationship for a loooong while and said she was sure her feelings would change. I said that she was right, and that we should stop hurting each other and just say our goodbye's in order to stop this endless cycle of both of us falling for each other (which happened about three times). We said our last goodbye's today and I feel like complete trash, as I feel like all I have done in the 4 years I have known her was just hurt her. My resolve at the moment is that I should stop all contact with her, to avoid hurting her and to stop my insanity of constantly trying to be with her, only to have the same result in the end (it's the definition ya know). I need to know if what I did/ what I'm doing is the right choice, people of Reddit, hear my plea!

A SIDE NOTE: I know, I'm still young and all that, I many opportunities, yadda yadda yadda, but let's get real here. This is serious to me. This is rather important to current me, despite the fact that I know I'm gonna look back on this memory and laugh. Just, please, none of that DAFUQ IS A YOUNG'IN DOIN WORRYIN ABOUT THIS?! Thank ye very much. :) Also I know I'm garbage for treating Lady Luck the way I did back then, I will repent for the rest of my life, alright?

TL;DR: I was in an on and off relationship with a girl for 4 years, only to have us say our last goodbye's as we decided to stop tormenting each other by talking to each other but not getting together. My choice was to not talk to her to stop hurting her. Reddit, hear my plea! Was saying goodbye forever to her the right thing to do? Should I have opted for another route? What can I do? And sorry if this is in the wrong sub-reddit, I'm a newb.

849,1xvrhh,"My GF and I are at a critical point in our relationship. We have been together for a few years, and it's time to decide whether we are going to get married. We have been living together for about a year and a half. We love each other nearly unconditionally, and we have grown together significantly.

We have also hit a point where we are finding ourselves at odds more than we would like. There are relatively minor differences that we can easily get past such as whether I have to go to sleep when she does, but there are also some more pertinent issues that seem to keep cropping up.

Mostly it comes down to squabbling and each partner not feeling appreciated. We express our affection in different ways, and sometimes that leads to both of us feeling left out. I like to be affectionate, but that often disturbs her personal space. She likes to talk to me, but sometimes my listening skills leave something to be desired. This leads to general hurt feelings on both sides, which turns minor differences into big disturbances. She in particular has a hard time letting go when we have had a small disagreement.

I feel that we are both starting to go through the motions somewhat as well. I am more guilty of this than she. She works long hours and comes home exhausted, leaving very little time for intimacy. I am self-employed and have sometimes long periods of down time interspersed within my work. Unfortunately, I am stagnating, and I don't know what I want to do with my career. I have let this negatively affect my personality, and I have become too lazy both in life and in terms of the relationship. I need to make more of an effort at courting her like I did early in our relationship, which might solve some of our problems.

Sex has always been a bit awkward between us. Neither of us are very experienced, and the range of things with which she is comfortable is very small. Sex has always been relatively infrequent, but it's now at around once or twice a month. It's always missionary. If I'm lucky, she will let me go down on her. I've received oral sex about 5 times in the course of the relationship, and if I ask for it, she shuts down because she doesn't like pressure in the bedroom. We talked about the infrequency of our sex tonight, and she said that she might feel more attracted to me if I was more active, which I grant is a reasonable request. (Again, a problem that might be solved if I put in more effort.) Due to my inexperience, I am very interested in having sex with other people, but I am nearly certain that she will never go for this.

We have, on more than one occasion, had a discussion about whether I was going to propose. Early in the relationship I was the more attached one, but I have grown indecisive, and the aforementioned reasons give me even more pause. She has hinted that she doesn't want to wait forever for a proposal but has not given me a timeline. I have vaguely decided that a proposal or break-up needs to happen within 6 months.

One final thing that gives me pause is that I don't know whether I want a child. She says that she will probably want one (and only one) when we are in our 30s. I'm totally on the fence. She says, perhaps rightly so, that if you marry someone, then you make it work as a couple and come to a compromise. But it scares me to think of what will happen if I decide that I can't be a father. I can't take that away from her, and at the same time I can't force myself into it.

It's time to make a decision. I definitely need to work on my maturity and put more effort into life in general. But do I do that with a woman with whom I've invested so much time and who I know loves me nearly unconditionally, or do I start over? Breaking up with her would be difficult for many reasons, not the least of which are practical. (We do have a year left on our apartment's lease, as well as some long-term shared finances, although I trust her implicitly.)

As Milan Kundera wrote in The Unbearable Lightness of Being:

&gt;While people are fairly young and the musical composition of their lives is still in its opening bars, they can go about writing it together and sharing motifs, but if they meet when they are older, their musical compositions are more or less complete, and every motif, every object, every word means something different to each of them.

My gut tells me that if I'm not fully in it, I should start fresh for both our sakes, but it's so hard to give up the foundation upon which we've built our relationship. I could probably solve our problems fairly easily as I stated above, but I'm not fully convinced, and I don't want to waste any more of her time if I can't be who she wants me to be.

At this point I figure either I need to:

* 1. Double my efforts and go for it,
* 2. Break it off immediately, or
* 3. Suggest that we see other people to see if it's right, help find appreciation for each other by seeing more of what's out there.

I guess it basically comes down to me needing to make up my mind. I don't expect anyone to do that for me, but suggestions are very welcome, and perhaps some have insight that I didn't think of.

1087,26wlo9,"Hi everyone! I'd like to add a little disclaimer saying that I hope this post makes sense. It's always been difficult for me to explain things to others. Sorry if it comes off strange.

My boyfriend and I are opposites in many ways. He's logical, obsessed with being neat and clean, good with finances, goal oriented, hardworking, shy and maybe bordering on antisocial, unemotional, dettached, money driven, health conscious and self-sufficient. I am spontaneous, emotional, mentally ill (ADHD/depression/anxiety/mood disorder), creative, compassionate, disorganized, laid-back and high-strung (if it's possible to have both characteristics simultaneously), bad with finances and a bit lazy although I prefer to say relaxed. 

We have been able to get along for the larger part of our relationship in spite of our differences. Our cultural upbringing has a lot to do with our differences as well. He's Chinese and he and his family are from China and he moved to the US as a pre-teen. I'm a white American and was born and raised here so our views on how life should be is so different. 

We've been having spats which is not like us because I prefer the live and let live way of life but his nagging at me to shower every day (I would like to add here that the most I go without showering is every other day, I do NOT have a problem with hygiene and he's the kind of guy who thinks to be clean is to stick your finger in your butthole in the shower to clean it so... yeah), clean this and that, do things his way all the time has just been setting me on edge. 

I'm a private person and become easily agitated if my personal space has been invaded. We had a bedroom that we share (he owns the house, by the way, and we've been living together for a year and a half) and I have a bedroom of my own although I don't sleep in it; it's more for my creative space and alone time. He often barges in my room without knocking which wouldn't bother me so much if I didn't feel like he was standing over me like a hawk and watching my every move. He judges me negatively because my space isn't very organized and becomes easily cluttered. This is an issue I've struggled with my entire life and my ADHD probably has a large hand in it but I do my very best to keep things in their place. I  often begin projects and forget to put them away and I also have a lot of stuff that I brought over when moving in. But like I said, I do my best to try and maintain organization not only because it pleases him but because I also feel less cluttered and more at peace when everything is neat. 

One of the things that bothers me is that I have a cat who is around 7 or 8 now and as a cat, she naturally sheds quite a bit. This REALLY bothers my boyfriend but he has never had a pet before and doesn't understand that animals don't understand things the way humans do. It really bugs me that he doesn't treat my cat as a member of the family but kind of like she's the scum of the Earth. :( This makes me so sad because I love her and have been raised with many pets ever since I was a little kid. It worries me that he does not feel compassion and love for animals which brings me closer to the issue at hand. 

So over the years, I have felt a huge lack of affection from him which has been tempting me to leave (although that's not an option right now as I'm waiting to hear back from several jobs). He doesn't hug or kiss me tenderly throughout the day, he doesn't give me little gifts that made him think of me or tell me sweet things about how much he cares for me, etc etc. I love to do all those things but it's useless with him because he's outright told me that he doesn't appreciate it. 

All of this came to a head last night when we were once again arguing about how I don't clean as much as I should, blah blah, when he told me that he did a google search and realized that he doesn't love or know how to love anyone. I think this has to do with his Dad and other stuff I'm not qualified to assess so I mentioned therapy as an option to him. It really pleased me that he acknowledged the issue because now we have a place to start working toward fixing this. He's very frugal and stressed about his financial obligations and his insurance plan isn't the greatest so he complained that it would be expensive. 

My question for you all is: What should I do? Should I start making a plan to leave so I can find someone who can fully love me and I can in return? Or do I try and stick it out with him and see if he will try therapy and hope for improvement in himself and our relationship? I just want him and myself to be happy. It would be so nice if we could come to a point where we could both accept each other and love each other's imperfections like normal people. :(

I completely support her in her decision, logically... But I would be lying if I said I liked it. Truth is, I guess, I live in a western society where I've grown accustomed to women being smooth and clean shaven, at least on legs and armpits, so as shallow as I feel for feeling this way, it does kind of turn me off. 


I wish I knew how to just get over it, that'd be easy if I knew how to do that. If your have any advice I'm more than open to it.


Here's the real question though. We haven't talked about it yet. We're away from each other for a few weeks, I knew she was probably making this decision soon, but what I thought didn't come up. I know it will come up, especially once we're in person again, and she'll ask me what I think.


So here's my crossroads. I want to always be honest with her, and if she asks me if I like it or what I think about it, well, the shallow part of me wants her to know that I really don't prefer it, or like it, and that it turns me off anytime I see it.


But I love her and I respect her and I support her decision making and her logic behind it from a feminist standpoint. It's not something I'd break up with her about... But I don't know how long it'll take me to get used to it either... 


So if she asks me what I think, should I be open with my preferences on body hair, especially armpits and legs, or just swallow it and reaffirm her decision and just tell her I'm okay with it 100%?

122,24lm09,"There’s a dilemma I would love help sorting through. Stay with me on this one. I have a long, maybe-relevant backstory to set up first:


Recently, I’ve been through a long and severe cycle of untreated Major Depression Disorder (MDD). It was something that I thought I could handle myself with diet and exercise. My previous cycles of MDD responded well to that change in lifestyle. But, Nope. Not this time. Unfortunately, the self-administered diet and exercise treatment ended up with me eating less than 500 calories a day (if anything) and curling up in bed contemplating the pros and cons of living verses dying. I’m a 5’8” woman and was a muscular, healthy 137lbs in November. By March I was down to 117lbs with my hipbones and spine grossly sticking out.


My MDD was exasperated when my boyfriend (recently ex) made a list of, in his words, things I did that affected our relationship. It read something like, “You don’t eat. You’re never happy. You’re pessimistic. You ignore your friends, etc.” Which are all pretty obvious symptoms of depression. I responded by saying it was a very hurtful and abrasive way to go about addressing problems in our relationship and how it’s unfair to use words like “always” and “never” when describing a person. He apologized about the way he went about it, but I could tell he still thought these were part of who I was and not symptoms.


That being, I fully realized that watching someone you care about go through depression and being helpless to make things better for them is excruciatingly hard. It takes an amazingly strong person to stick around when their loved one becomes a shell of their former self. I was able to logically realize that being around me sucked. As a result of this “list” tiff, I did my best to only be around him when I could play The Happy, Optimistic Girlfriend. This came with predictable problems. Now I had to expend all of this emotional energy to act happy combined with taking five tough upper-level college courses and tutoring. I was bone-crushingly exhausted and hanging on by a thread.


It should be obvious by now, but cue messy emotional breakup snapping that thread. My Jerk Brain finally succeeded in convincing me my situation was utterly and completely hopeless. There was no light at the end of the tunnel. There was no “getting better”. The breakup caused me to hit rock bottom. I’d rather not go into too many embarrassing details about it. Suffice to say, my ex called in a wellness check for me and contacted multiple friends of mine to let them know that I wasn’t in a good place. That night it became clear to me that my friends and the police would continue being annoying and taking up my precious energy until I gave them what they wanted. First I told the police I didn’t want to go to the hospital, even though I probably should have. Then I promised my friends I would seek out help in the morning.


As promised, the next day I dragged myself to my college’s counseling center. It was seriously hard as fuck to do. Very, very, very hard. But, I’m glad I went. Within a week they prescribed me an anti-depressant. Two weeks later my soul-sucking exhaustion was completely gone! I started eating regularly again, jogging every-other day; and, best of all, I no longer had my Jerk Brain telling me that I was worthless and better off dead. My quality of life improved exponentially as a result of weekly counseling sessions, keeping a journal, and the antidepressant. The turnaround has been amazing and wonderful and just wow. It’s been about a month and a half since the breakup/start of treatment, and I can honestly say I’m on the upswing.

Ok, now that I fleshed out the backstory I can get to the meat of my question. Since the breakup I haven’t been in contact with the ex at all. In my counseling session the other day it came up that he didn’t send me a text on my birthday. We talked about that a bit. Mostly I said it would have been painful if he sent a message and it was also painful that he didn’t. Either scenario was lose-lose for my feelings. 


That led into him asking if I wanted to contact my ex. I think I scoffed and said, “I don’t want to contact him or hear from him. I’m still learning to live my life without him in it.” My counselor responded, “If you came in next week and told me you had written him a letter letting him know how, for example, you feel he unfairly blamed you for things outside of your control and sent it that it would be ok. You can communicate if you do or don’t want him in you life anymore, too.” He went on to tell me that people usually heal faster if they let the person they’re angry with know exactly how hurt they are and why. That, “How the person responds to your letter, or doesn’t respond, is on them and not you for sharing your feelings.”


This advice immediately hit my “RED ALERT – THIS IS A BAD IDEA” button. My councilor and I . . . I guess you can say argued-as much as you can argue with a psychologist-about this for the rest of the session. I feel I can deal with my hurt on my own. Lashing out at him with a long letter/email would just reinforce the Crazy Ex-Girlfriend stereotype and it would be the opposite of constructive for my healing process.

Now, I’ve been reading relationship books, advice columns, and relationship advice forums (/r/relationships included!) obsessively for the last ten years of my life. So, I feel like I can claim to be, at the very least, discerning on the subject of good advice and terrible advice. This is also not the first time I’ve heard of someone’s counselor letting them know that writing an angry letter to their ex and sending it can be beneficial for their healing process. In contrast, roughly everything I have ever read on breakups states, pretty clearly that it’s the worst idea in the entire world and DON’T DO IT when the wound is so fresh. It will hurt the healing process.


Now that I’ve written this probably-way-too-long-for-the-question-I-asked-story, what is /r/relationships thoughts? Is writing to an ex you haven’t been in contact with to tell them how hurt you are, how well you’re doing, or about XYZ ever a good idea?

I like the little chats we had, about our day, interesting things that happened, etc. As of now, we've known each other for a little more than a year, but during our 9-month long relationship, we've grown so close that we each considered each other our best friends. We were each other's firsts, and I changed his mind about getting married -- he wanted to marry me. However, things started becoming worse and worse in the past couple of months. Trust issues, over-communicating, starting an LDR, busy with school, and lots of crying. I tried to break up at the end of August, but he convinced me to stay for a couple more weeks; he promised he would treat me better and that he would change. However, I still felt the same way about breaking up with him. So, we broke it off 4 days ago. He told me a few months before that if we were ever to break up, he wouldn't want to be friends with me. I on the other hand, would not mind. I asked him the same thing on the day we broke up, and his decision remained the same.


Now that I'm thinking back about it though, I would much rather have him as a friend currently -- at least an acquaintance. I'm totally regretting that we took our relationship so far (i.e. over-communicating, texting each other every other minute), or even got into a BF-GF relationship at all. 


He already blocked me on FB, told me not to text him (his last text was: There will always be a special place reserved for you in my heart. Goodbye. Forever....I think he was being overly dramatic though). I also found out from my friend that the evening we broke up, he went out with his female friend to drink and he was miserable for the next couple of days (maybe he is now, I don't know). How should I cope with this? I hate regretting.

I get off of work early, and I have to pick up another computer I as working on for a few friends. I get to the house and do a courtesy knock, because I don't physically live there, but still have time in rent paid. So I walk in and she come out of the bedroom and closes the door behind her. I grab the computer and need to grab more socks as well. I ask if I can go in the bedroom to grab some and she says sure. (we had this black lab 1.7yrs old together) The dog is wired, not sure why, but I open the door and what happens, she (the dog) immediately runs to the closet. Nudges it open with her nose and at this point the gig is up. The dude is bent down like a little bitch hiding in the closet. At this point I am angry but I have a very firm set of values and morals. Instead of kicking his ass or killing him. I walk out. Take my shit and leave.

It just surprises me at how a person not knowing what they want (that was said to be true) after one week fucking another person... AFTER a five year relationship.

672,2wtyh1,"I'm going to start from the beginning of the story. We are both in 6th grade when we meet, sometime around 2005 or 2006. I meet this girl, that I'll call G from here on out. In 6th grade G really had a crush on me but at the time I wasn't interested in her. G was accepting of this and we became good friends for all of middle school. We shared a lot of fun times together and everything was a casual friendship. We built a bond that was awesome and I felt very comfortable telling G about everything and anything that was going on in my life. 


High school came about and during 9th grade I developed feelings for G. When I told her about how I felt she said that it was too late as she no longer shared those feelings. It was ok, I took it well. She started dating a lot of people during high school and we grew distanced because of this. From the end of 9th grade to the end of senior year we were very distant and didn't talk. I got into relationship of my own that lasted for a year during 11th grade.


Randomly sometime during the summer following our graduation in June 2011 G called me up and asked if I wanted to hang out with her and another one of our good friends from middle school. I said of course and we hung out for about a month during the summer. I found out that G and I would be going to the same university and we had been assigned to the same orientation. It was awesome to be able to go to orientation with someone that I trusted in deeply. 


We hung out a couple of times our first semester, but she once again got into another relationship. Again we grew distant from each other and I would rarely hear anything from her, I would always text her to help with my girl problems and she would give me advice and stuff. 


Fast forward to December 2013. The last time I had spoken to G before that was sometime in the summer of 2013 when I needed some help with personal problems. We both got invited to a christmas party our mutual friend from middle school was having. I showed up and what do you know G is there with her boyfriend. We start talking with our mutual friend and its an instant connection. We all promise that we will start hanging out more often and that we cant go missing from each others lives for so long. G's birthday is in January and she invites us to celebrate with her and her boyfriend. 


Its now January 2014. I get a text about where G's birthday celebration is going to be at. I show up late and everyone is already kinda drunk. When G comes to hug me I instantly felt like this was a different kind of hug, its hard to put in words but it didn't feel like a hug you give to your bestfriend. I saw her boyfriend and he looked pretty weireded out by the situation. Any way we had more drinks and it was a great time. That weekend we were going to go clubbing to finish celebrating G's birthday. 


Saturday came around and I asked G if it was cool to take one of my cousins (25M), she said yeah it was fine. So we arrive to her boyfriends house to pre-game before going to the club. My cousin tells me that my friend G is hot and he wants to bang her. I tell him that she has a boyfriend and my cousin responded I don't care. We go to the club and everyone has a great time. 


The next day G texts me and asks me who my hot cousin is. I give her the details and tell her that he thinks she's hot. She plays it off and nothing happens. 


G, our middle school friend (the one I've been mentioning the whole story, lets call her AM), and I start hanging out a lot during January. Things between G and her boyfriend start to turn sour, he thinks that she's cheating on him with me. G grabs my phone and texts my cousin her number. The next day my cousin(hes a man whore) tells me that he's flirting with G non stop and that they are going to hook up. AM and me tell her not to do it because she still has a boyfriend and that she shouldn't cheat on him. It didn't really matter and within a couple of days of flirting with my cousin they hook up.



Still in January G, AM, and I plan a weekend trip and are very excited. G says her boyfriend isn't coming, no big deal he was a cool guy. Friday night comes along and I get picked up in order to go on our trip. At the last minute G's boyfriend decides that he wants to tag along and G isn't very happy about it. By this point I suspect that G's boyfriend was getting suspicious that she was cheating on him, and I believe he thought it was with me since G, AM and I had started to hang out almost everyday. 



During the trip everything is going well except for the fact that G refuses to sleep with her boyfriend. He started to get mad at the whole situation. On Sunday while at the pool G and her boyfriend get in a fight that ends up in them breaking up. During the next few weeks G continues to hook up with my cousin. I told her to get away from him because she started falling for him. As a friend I told her he wasn't the guy she wanted him to be, he only plays that picture to get into girls pants have fun for a month or two and then dip. I also tell my cousin to back off and stop seeing her cause she was going through a breakup and I didn't want her to get hurt. After telling both of them to stop what they had going, they still continued to hook up. 


February rolls around and I finally talk some sense into G. She stops seeing my cousin and I stop talking to him as a result of him not backing off as I had asked him and he had told me he would do. Valentines day comes and AM, G, and me plan to al go out to dinner together. We go to dinner and as we are leaving decide to go on a weekend trip. We all pack our stuff and leave. 


When we get to our destination AM calls the guy she is talking to and asks him to come for the weekend. AM goes into the room and locks the door and leaves me and G in the other room. I've shared a bed with G many times before and nothing had ever happened. On this particular night one thing led to another and we had sex. When we finished our friend AM came out of the room and told us that she wasn't very pleased with what had happened because it would ruin our friendship (should've listened to her).


G and I started to hook up with more regularity and over the course of time She started developing feelings. I on the other hand wasn't too sure how to feel about the whole situation, less than a month ago she had hooked up with my cousin.


The months went by and I started getting feelings for G. We went on a cruise sometime during May with some friends. During this cruise G and I hooked up everyday. On the last day of the cruise we were in the club and G started dancing with some other guy. I got jealous but played it off. After a while I got very upset with what was happening and left to go to the room. As soon as I opened the door I started to throw up. I had butterflies because of what I had just seen. I was repulsed by seeing G with another guy. I didn't speak to her for a week after the cruise and I was almost certain that what we had was over with. 


I receive a text from her late at night about after a week of not talking to her that she wants to talk to me and that she was going to pick me up in 5 minutes. I was determined that I wasn't going to hook up with her but I gave in and slept over her house. 


Our relationship took a weird turn. She wanted to be my girlfriend, but I was against it. I wasn't going to make a girl that had hooked up with my cousin my girlfriend, it felt weird and I wouldn't be able to live with that fact. While her feelings got stronger, I also started to develop feelings albeit at a much slower pace than her. 


Around October is when things started getting bad. She would tell me that I wasn't loving enough and that I was too cold hearted towards her. We would argue almost once a month about the same thing. To me it all boiled down to the fact that although we were technically together, the fact that she wasn't my official girlfriend was starting to hurt her a lot. It's not like I didn't like her or anything, we were in love, I just always felt that she really did love me more than I did. From october to january we had he same fight monthly, it would always end the same, I would promise that I would change and that I would start loving her more and being more of an actual boyfriend type. 


January passed and we had our typical fight. We still did everything together, as if we were boyfriend and girlfriend. About 3 weeks ago I came to the conclusion that I was never going to be able to provide G with the relationship she wanted. I told her that we needed to stop seeing each other. She took it very hard, as did I. A week after not talking to each other and living in misery she called me and said she was coming over. we talked for about an hour and I let her know that I felt empty without her. It wasn't the same being without her. We reconciled and got back together. Everything seemed fine. 


I planned a  quick valentine's trip for the 2 of us. Everything was done very fast and kinda half assed and on sunday as we were driving back she started to act weird. I didn't know what was wrong. Finally on monday she tells me that she was disappointed cause she felt the trip was half assed and that I hadn't planned anything and it made her feel used. I apologized and admitted to my fault. Tuesday we spoke like normal and everything seemed good. Wednesday also went as normal, I picked her up at night and we went to go get something sweet to eat. Everything was normal, we were kissing holding hands etc. I actually was thinking about asking her to be my official girlfriend, I had gotten over the fact that she slept with my cousin and was ready to make us official. But then Thursday rolled along.


 She texted me in the morning that she was feeling weird and that she wanted to have her space because she was still upset about the weekend, I told her it was ok and that I would give her the space she needed and wouldn't be texting her but that she could contact me at anytime, she said ok. We didn't talk much Thursday or Friday or Saturday. 


Yesterday she sent me a text saying that we were officially done. That she was tired of loving me so much more than I did, which at this point is not so true, I love her so much I was ready to put everything aside and make her my girlfriend. I'm at a loss for words. I literally begged her to give me one more chance, I told her to think about everything we've been through. All she said was no we were done. 


Now I come to reddit. I just wanted to let this all out. I don't have many friends and I don't feel comfortable talking about my problems with people (thats why this is a throwaway). Reddit what can I do to let go? How do I cope with losing a huge part of my life?




TL;DR: Best friend on and off since 6th grade. We hook up last year. Technically boyfriend and girlfriend, although not official. We love each other but she says she's tired of not having a real boyfriend and wants out. I was almost over all my insecurities and was going to ask her out to make it official.

He has a very stressful job -- we both do.  He had just started and I did everything I could to try to make his life less stressful but it seemed like everything I did was wrong.  

I tried to make him breakfast to eat and a lunch to bring with him on the morning of his first day.  I usually always make him breakfast in the morning and he had hinted the other day he'd like to have lunch to take instead of having to eat out.  He reacted by yelling at me for cooking because it made the house smell like food.  He yelled at me for making the wrong kind of lunch.  And then he yelled at me because I wouldn't look him in the eye after that. 

Another time he yelled at me for under-cooking sausage.  Then he yelled at me again for overcooking them.  

He yelled at me once because I caught him in a lie and called him out on it.  He somehow turned it around on me, kicked over my table, breaking a vase.  

I became very depressed awhile ago and it was hard for me to keep a happy face on with a positive attitude everyday.  He yelled at me for this.  Tearfully, I described to him how I felt and how I wanted to see a counselor or some professional.  He yelled at me for bringing this into his life -- saying he didn't need this while simultaneously telling me I needed to handle his stress and his temper.  

Once I suggested we go to counseling together.  He yelled at me for this, saying (words I'll never forget) The only person who needs help here is you.  

I've trained myself not to visibly react as much to the yelling.  Crying only seems to make him angrier.  If I do cry he'll become angry and tell me to stop crying.  If I try to explain why I'm crying (I feel attacked/my feelings are being invalidated/I feel like I'm being blamed for things out of my control) he gets even more angry. 

I've thought about leaving, all my friends want me to leave but I just can't bring myself to do it.  I don't know if it's because we've been together for so long or if I genuinely love him.

Hi guys, I need help on how I am supposed to phrase what I would like from her, and don't want it to come off the wrong way so she won't get defensive.

Basically, I was with my SO over the weekend. When I came back after 4 days, I noticed that part of the apartment was flooded with my bedroom included. My roommate clogged the toilet and then tried to flush, which flooded the part of the apartment. **this is the 3rd time she flooded the toilet. I told her recently ways to prevent the toilet from flooding the apartment: turn off the water valve near the toilet, it's when you try to flush that floods everything and at that point CALL MAINTENANCE because they will fix it for you.**

I called maintenance, and they immediately came up and cleaned the water. I hired someone to clean and disinfect my room and the hallway. I counted the damages: I have to throw out about $300 worth of shoes and clothing because they literally have shit stains (from my roommate)). I spent about $100 replacing everything else. Initially my roommate offered to replace anything I needed and apologized, but I said it was OK because those items weren't a big deal to me.

I just discovered that I had a leather bag which soaked up all the dirty water and a few more items were damaged. There was one dress that I really loved and it would be hard to replace, so I nicely asked her over text. It was around $60. She started saying that she lost $200 worth of bedsheets, and that I can take my dress to the dry cleaners. She did not offer to help me find a good place or offer money for me to use the dry cleaners. This girl makes more money than me (she makes about 100K) and I am pretty pissed right now. I texted her back that I will speak with her tonight. She has a history of lying so she can't get blamed. I documented everything I lost by taking pictures.


Basically, I will see my roommate tonight. How do I bring up that I want her to pay for my dress ($60), or the dry cleaning bill?  I'm asking for this because I did not cause the toilet clogging and overflowing. This is a tricky situation because she was not being very forthcoming about paying for the dress and gave some backass reason to dodge the issue. I already spent $100 and lost $300 worth of other stuff.

   
**tl;dr**: Roommate caused the toilet to overflow and is being dodgy about paying for my dress that she ruined. How do I nicely ask her to pay?

1110,2dkeak,"Alright I know I'm going to get a lot of flak for this but I still need an outside perspective on what I'm dealing with right now. Prepare yourself, it's a long one. So, I've (23.5 yrs old) been with my boyfriend Tom (25 yrs old) for a year and half and he's incredible. We broke up for 4 months at the beginning of our relationship because he was having a lot of personal problems and felt that having a girlfriend wasn't right at the time. He contacted me out of the blue after the 4 months and said I was amazing, he couldn't stop thinking about me, and that he had made a mistake breaking up with me. We got back together and things were fantastic! We both fell in love and I was so happy because I had never clicked with anyone before like I did with him. He lives an hour away, though, so we only see each other a few times a month. 

The only issue we ever had with our relationship is that it's difficult for him to express himself and sometimes he distances himself from people when he's having a rough time at work or something. His mom died when he was 8 and then his uncle died when he was 15 and then he dated a girl for 4 years that fucked him up pretty bad emotionally. We also took a look at the 5 Love Languages theory that you always see mentioned in this sub and realized his way of expressing his love is through physical touch and small acts of service and my way is through verbal affection. I know without a doubt that he loves me; I can tell when he looks at me and when he holds me, but it's difficult for him to actually say I love you (he likes to say it less often because he wants it to be more special and truly have an impact when he does say it). We talked about our problems and things really got better for a few months. We figured out how to show each other our care and affection better, and he stopped isolating himself whenever he had a problem. 

Several months ago, he found out he has to move potentially across the country for his job in a year but things are still up in the air. All of a sudden, he went into emotional self-defense mode and I could tell he was distancing himself. We eventually had a big emotional talk because I was so stressed out that he was going to break up with me and he admitted that he's really scared of getting hurt again and he's detaching himself from me a bit in anticipation of having to leave. He doesn't even know if he has to leave though but he said if he does, staying together for this next year will mean that we'll just fall deeper in love and the move will be even harder because I won't be able to move with him since I'm in grad school for the next 3 years. I asked him if he just wanted to break up now and he told me no, that he didn't want to lose me and he'd regret it. 

Despite that, it feels like I hardly have a boyfriend anymore. We've been seeing each other less frequently and he's texting me less (he has a super big project at work and is being worked to the bone, but still, he's only texting like every other day...) so I'm hardly getting affirmation that he loves me since verbal and written expression has never been his strong suit. When we're together, it's amazing, but it's really hard when we only see each other two or three times a month. It's going to continue to be like this for at least the next two months because both our schedules are jam packed. 

Here comes the other player in the story: I met Ryan (27 yrs old) at my job 8 months ago and I was immediately attracted to him when I met him. I had a teeny work crush on him back then but Tom and I were doing amazing and the crush quickly faded as Ryan and I hardly saw each other. A lot of our coworkers mentioned to me that it's pretty obvious Ryan likes me a lot and that you can just tell by the way he looks at me. I let Tom know so he was aware of it, but he's not really the jealous type and just said he appreciated that I was honest with him. 

In the last few months that Tom and I have been rocky and he's been acting distant and hot and cold, I've had to work with Ryan a lot more. All our coworkers are really close, so I've hung out with him in group settings outside of work, but never alone. We've gotten to know each other a lot better and I quickly realized that I actually do like him. I think about him a lot, my stomach does that jumpy thing when I see him, and I had a damn dream about him last week (...that kind of dream). Apparently he drunkenly told one of our coworkers that he really cares about me and wishes we could be together and that he would make me his top priority but he would never make a move because he respects that I'm in a relationship and that he doesn't want to get in the way of love. I could tell, though, that Ryan would be a really great partner and we have a lot of the same interests. 

YES REDDIT I know this is emotional cheating of some sort, trust me, I feel like a really fucking terrible person for it. I've talked extensively about this with my roommate/best friend and she can tell I'm pretty torn. These are both really really great guys. She asked me if I would feel this way about Ryan if Tom wasn't being so distant and I believe the answer is yes, just to a lesser extent. I truly do love Tom and I've definitely talked to him about feeling neglected because I want to work on our relationship, but things haven't gotten better in the past month. 

I really don't know what to do guys. I'm at the age where I don't want to be wasting my time on a relationship if I don't see it working out in the long run, yet I love Tom and wish we could be together. He said he's really happy with me right now and to not think about the future, but when I asked him about our future, he didn't really give me a solid answer and that we'll cross that bridge when we get there. My roommate hung out with Ryan and my coworkers and me and she told me that she can see why I'm struggling because Ryan really is so sweet and caring and he would be great to me. 

I wonder if I'm feeling this way because Tom and I are struggling right now, or if being on the rocks has lifted the rose colored glasses and I can truly see what my relationship with him is. My roommate pointed out that if this is how he deals with stress now, imagine how he would act when bigger issues arise or if he moves. I don't want to break up with him because I would always think what if and I would be so torn up with regret, but I also need to think about the future and if there are other people out there that can make me happy. I would never ever do anything inappropriate with Ryan as I've been cheated on before and it sucks ass (part of the reason why I feel so terrible about my torn feelings). 

Help reddit, please give me some objective insight on this. Of course, I can't include every detail so you guys don't have the full picture of Tom and I's relationship or how great Ryan is. I know people on this sub like to grab onto one sentence and let it skew the whole story, but hopefully I gave enough detail so you guys can get an idea of what I'm dealing with.

411,2drw82,"Now before you get out your torches and pitchforks, let me give you some background. The boyfriend and I are long distance. Like, a few thousand miles away long distance. He's in a band that is very popular in the town where he's from. Now last night was their last performance in that town, as they're moving to another state this week. 

So after their performance last night, he's taking pictures with the young fangirls, and with one of them in particular (around 16 yrs old), he was really cheesing it up. Apparently people started chanting kiss her! so she leaned in and kissed him. He did not kiss her back, but he let it happen, and he told me about it as soon as he could because he felt bad and wanted to be honest with me. I told him i appreciated his honesty, and that even though it bothered me, i understood, because she's young and he does have this dreamboat rockstar image that is very desirable, and there was a lot of peer pressure going on. He made it clear it won't happen again, and that it was just for the sake of the picture. 

Now, i didn't let him know, but i am pretty upset. He is a sweet, honest, genuinely kind and humble person. He was extremely sincere when he told me what happened, and didn't make me feel bad in and way shape or form for being bothered by it. We're committed to eachother exclusively, and he knows that. Which is why i told him i understood. Which i do, but i am more upset about it than i let on. 

Am i overreacting? I know in the long run that's a small thing that happened, and it was just a little teeny bopper fan girl getting caught up in the moment of meeting a handsome guitarist in a popular band, but it still doesn't sit right with me. He reassured me i have absolutely nothing to worry about, and i told him to put his lips on lockdown, which he agreed to, then we laughed about it. 

I guess i'm just looking for a little validation here and for someone to tell me i'm justified in being upset. Do I bring it back up? we already laughed it off after i scolded him. I don't want to seem clingy or smothering or anything, especially since we're long distance. I've never been in a situation like this, so i'm looking for some guidance i suppose.

488,34o3gs,"Okay so here's a little about me first; you can skip this and cut to the meat and potatoes past the break but I think the background info is pertinent. I'm 21, in college, and I guess decent looking enough and socially adept enough that girls seem to be interested in me from time to time. My whole dating life has consisted of two long serious relationships that happened consecutively with no other women involved between the two. This has lead to situation where I really haven't had to seriously flirt with a women (where I had any designs of anything other than conversation) since I was 15 years old. Fast forward to this Fall when I was brutally dumped by the woman I loved who I was convinced at the time had the potential to be wife material. My life took a bad turn and I let myself become somewhat of a shut-in alcoholic until my friends more or less forced me to be social again and clean my life up.

As time separated me from the breakup I was put into social situations where women were around who could be potentially interested in hooking-up with me. I would go on to find that I could talk to women totally normally unless the nature of the conversation was flirtatious where I would find myself unable to be myself, despite being attracted to the women around me. I've never been one to just hook-up with random people (call me old fashioned but I've always held to the idea that you should know someone intimately before you become intimate with them, I'm totally unreligious though) until this weekend where I totally disregarded that mantra (yes of course there was alcohol involved)


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


Last weekend I was hanging out with my boys who are also going to live with me next year so naturally as college students who also happen to be good friends the best way to bond is getting totally destroyed together. It was also the day of our Spring concert so my alcohol consumption started around 3 PM and continued in fits and starts until 3AM. I'm the only single member of my close friend group of about six guys, and they have constantly badgered me in the past about why I don't want to just drunkenly plow some girl and get back on the horse. Everything that afternoon was going to plan until we joined up with my boys respective girlfriends and some other girls whom I remembered meeting but not much else otherwise. It's probably 7 at this point and I'm buzzed but still pretty operable.


The headliner of the concert wasn't slated to go on until 11 so there was a 3ish hour period where I was around a bunch of ladies in a pretty flirty environment. There were plenty of girls there, but I don't remember talking with the one I would eventually spend the night with and my memory was still pretty solid at that point.


The girls there looked good but because of my weird newfound fear of talking to women I'm interested in or who are interested in me I didn't say anything to any of them that would have conveyed my interest but I continued slugging beers right up until the minute we left for the show. The show was standard college fair (cramped, hot, sweaty floors, and couples at various stages of public love-making) and I remember absolutely nothing prior to me meeting this girl, we'l call her Sara. Like I said I didn't remember her from our time before the show but she got separated from the ladies she was with and somehow ended up standing in front of me.


Next thing I know we were grinding together (something I feel like I couldn't have initiated because of my hangup and the fact I don't normally get down like that, but I was fine with it) and exchanging names. I had a feeling she was someone's younger sister because of how much she looked like a girl I see occasionally so apparently (I don't recall this) I asked her to pull out her ID so I could check with my phone that she was 18. I got the feeling it wasn't this girls first rodeo by the way she moved, and by the events that would transpire post concert.


At some point during the show she turned to face me and in a move totally uncharacteristic for me, I leaned in a laid one on her and we ended up making out and doing some light foolin' around for whatever made up the rest of the show. Her and I got separated after the show and I ended up with two of my boys and we started to walk back to our dorms. I went to turn towards my dorm and break from the group when my friends inquired as to why I wasn't going with them to find Sara who was probably with their girlfriends. I said I was tired and because I'm not really the one night stand guy I used that as a cover for leaving.


What happens next was dictated to me by one of my friends who witnessed her saying this stuff, but aparentally the show all she could talk about was me and wanting to spend the night in my room with all the implications that would involve. By this time I had had a few more bedtime beers and was well past the point of solidly drunk. My friend that was with her was kind enough to pass her my phone number without asking and she texted me asking if I wanted to burn (something we discussed previously at the concert), and in my condition I wasn't gonna question a beautiful woman who was looking to match.


I of course ended up making the trek to the dorm she was staying in for the weekend, to find that she was using the bathroom when I got there. Upon arrival a girl I recognized but had no previous interaction with approached me telling me that Sara was totally blackout drunk (something I believed to be true as I hadn't asked or seen how much alcohol she had ingested). After hearing this from another person I made the call that I wasn't gonna plow her if she was that drunk, even though at my current level of drunkenness I totally wanted to take this girl to pound town.


When we got back to my dorm it was totally apparent that she was interested in having sex, which I kindly explained wouldn't be happening because I didn't casually hook-up (I left out the bit about how I was told she was trashed) and she seemed to take it pretty well. Before and after we went to smoke we got physical again which eventually progressed to the bed and us doing pretty much everything we could have without having sex. We ended up staying up for almost 3 hours after I picked her up messing around and getting to know each each other. This is where my ambiguity about the situation begins to set in.


The stuff we talked about that night was more in-depth than I assume typical conversations that happen during random hooks to be. We talked about how interesting we found each other and made specific plans to get together again so we could actually have sex and see what if anything else would come of this. Normally I wouldn't put any stock in that conversation except that 3 plus hours after picking her up I was sobering up and I assume she must have as well. I gave her a kiss and finally fell asleep.


When I woke up (before her) I was convinced she was gonna have no idea who I was or how we met, which was still something that I had no idea how it transpired. She came to about an hour after I woke up with a near total recollection of what had happened. Surprised, I asked her how much how much she drank last night and was flabbergasted when she told me she only had a few beers and never even got that hammered. Then the regret hit me that I didn't seal the deal and disregard my reservations on hooking up to plow a good-looking interesting woman -- a regret I had for probably the first time in my dating career. We burned again that morning and spend our last hours together in the same manner we did the night before, making out and the like. Before she left I expressed that she should text me sometime, which she said she would (something I assumed they all say). I passed out for another 6 hours of recovery sleep and woke to a text from Sara. We talked the rest of the day about various things while she travelled home to her college. At the end of that night I texted her goodnight and decided I'd gauge her interest in me by not texting her the next day and seeing if she reached out (kids these days are stupid for not just asking). She did that day, I did the day after, and we've still been talking almost a week after the event in question.


We've talked about it and we made soft plans for her to come visit me for at least a weekend over the summer when I'll be living on the beach. She seemed very interested in that proposition going as far to say that she was so excited to see me again. To this point I'm totally on board but I do have some reservations about her because I have no idea if were on the same page about where this is going. For one, she's younger than me but seems more than mature for her age so it's a non-issue. The actual thing that has me confused is that when we talk she doesn't really ask me things about myself that I would expect at the start of a relationship (if that's even what this is, I have no idea), which makes me think she might just be looking to come to the beach for a few days for some sex. Looking at our conversations I found that I really didn't ask her much that would have elicited responses that would yield more information about her and her background either so she could conceivably be just following my lead? Also she mentioned that she is somewhat religious (not practicing or anything), which makes me think she might not(?) hookup with random guys that often, but then again she did with me so what do I make of that. Because of our age difference, the fact that we have mutual friend groups that intersect regularly, and the fact that I'd look like a total loser getting curved by a freshman for thinking our situation was something it wasn't. 


That plan sounds nice except I know she'll be expecting sex this time and I'd be kinda going against my objections to having sex with people I don't know or care about intimately. Also now that I think about it I'm also worried that since we were somewhat drunk while meeting each other that whatever clicked that night wouldn't exist independent of alcohol consumption, which leaves me with this horrible picture of a weekend from hell with a girl I hardly know that consists entirely of shitty sex with no emotional connection.


So what do I do Reddit? Do I throw my antiquated (and probably wimpy) ideas of sex and relationships to the wind in the chance that we click the same way and discover that there could be legitimate feelings between us during what may turn out to be an awesome weekend with an awesome girl. Or do I chalk all this up to a girl who does this often and tells all the guys she hooks up with the same thing, and is looking for a weekend of casual sex with a guy who will take her to dinner and pay attention to her, but nothing past that? Or I guess option 3 which would be that I'm totally overthinking this to the point that I sound crazy and I should just let things happen naturally and see what comes of this if anything. So which is it y'all? Or some combo of all three?


Also if anyone has an opinion on wether or not I should even care about the fact we had both been drinking? Did the alcohol make us artificially interested or was it the social lubricant that removed the barriers that would normally prevent us from being so open?

   
**tl;dr**: I don't typically casually hook up with women for moral (non-religious) reasons. I got wicked drunk and did just about that apart from actually having sex with her because I was told she was annihilated.

I am a [20M] going into my junior year of college, she is a [20F] also going into the junior year of college, however, she had decided to study abroad in Korea for this semester. I met her my freshman year, and she was more of an acquaintance until a couple months ago where we met again and really hit it off. We have been going on dates for the entire time and each one seemed like we both had a lot of fun.


After our second date, we hugged and I gave her a kiss on the forehead, she then revealed to me that she would not enjoy a long-distance relationship and told me that we should just remain friends and then think about where we stood when she came back from Korea - she said she didn't want to lead me on and that there was no point in continuing to date. I told her that she was not leading me on and that I could make my own decisions and then told her that I would still like to go on dates with her and she invited me to a quick dinner. Well, she kind of accepted my reply, but she kept restating to keep things extremely slow and thus I refrained from giving her anything more physical and maintained only hugs or small touches.


Then just last week, I felt as though our connection became much stronger, we talked for a long time and found out more about each other's personal lives, she even initiated the next date for us to go on and texted me with much more enthusiasm as usual. Afterwards, I stared into her eyes and I could see something, but I didn't want to act upon it in respect for her wanting to keep things slow. I texted her later that night asking her to meet again this weekend, but she said to ask again on Wednesday.


Well, I asked again on Wednesday and she straight up told me that she liked me, but she isn't feeling it anymore then hung up the phone. I thought on it for a couple of hours of what happened, and I believe that she wanted to break it all off before going to Korea so that she wouldn't have any emotional baggage on her trip and thus could enjoy her time to the fullest. While I do think my theory is very plausible, I also feel like I did not do enough even though she said to take it very slowly. I texted her again to meet me one last time and she has accepted it, this is likely my last chance to say what I want before the door closes.


I want to tell her to have fun on her trip without me being an emotional burden, but I also want to tell her that I would like to wait for her until she comes back without sounding like a clingy bastard.  I wanted and still want to show her my romantic side but I felt like it was inhibited by her wish and thus I was not able to get my feelings across. What's my next course of action, do I spill my guts out or do I take the high road and wish her luck in the future?

We have been very fortunate in the financial department with our jobs, and we do everything on our own. I don't ask for help from my parents, because I want to show I can take care of my own family. I say this knowing that many (like most of my family members) say I am growing up too fast. I agree, but there isn't anything I can do to change that now, only adapt in a positive way. Since everything started to happen, my mother, who I have been very close to all my life, has become very bitter towards every decision regarding the new baby, or my life in general. Basically what I'm looking for here is advice from anyone who severely clashes with their parents and their SO. My mother told me she feels as if she has failed as a parent, because of a few reasons:

-I don't want to keep my last name when we get married. I want to take hers. It's always been my preference to not associate myself with my last name due to personal reasons (my dads an asshole basically). Obviously the baby will have my girlfriends last name as well and that is where my mothers old fashioned upbringing comes in. She HATES this idea, and the way she acts hurts my feelings. I understand she can have her opinion, but she blatantly disregards my wishes for it and says I'm wrong. 

-Religion...I won't go into debate with this, but I don't want to baptize or force religion with my son. I want to educate him on the different religions and possibilities that life will offer when he grows up. Religion was forced onto me all my life, and I have grown to hate it, not God. Of course my mother takes this one to heart. She never lets this down and it creates so much strain between us.

I don't have much, and there are a few more things that bother me regarding my moms attitude towards everything, but I'm just looking for help in how to handle my relationship with my mother and my girlfriend, which is civil in public, but when not around there is a bit of bad blood. I don't want to damage anything I have with my anyone, but I know making everyone happy is impossible.

96,2qw5kq,"Wall of text incoming. I’ve done my best to break it up thematically, but thanks in advance to anyone who makes it through this novel. 

**Cliff notes/TL;DR:** I’m thinking of ending a 9-year relationship with my girlfriend because I feel like we’ve grown apart, I feel underappreciated and that the burdens in our relationship are highly unequal, and I’m not very sexually attracted to her anymore. I feel guilty for feeling all these things, and go back and forth between wanting to break up and thinking that I should stay and work on things. I’m seeking advice on how I should make this decision, whether my feelings are legitimate reasons to end a relationship, etc. 

**Current situation:** my girlfriend and I have been dating for about 9 years. Neither of us puts much stock in being legally married, but we functionally are in many respects. We’ve lived together for years. I am increasingly unfulfilled by the relationship but have been doing my best to be a good partner despite these feelings. I don’t think she suspects that much of anything is wrong. I’ll detail my reasons for being dissatisfied.

**1)  Growing apart.** We started dating when we were barely past being teenagers, now we’re 30. When we got together we meshed perfectly, but I feel like I’ve grown up a lot while she…hasn’t. We don’t really share many common interests anymore. I find her personality, in terms of things like her manners of speaking, the way she engages in conversations, the way she acts in social settings, grating and irritating. Basically, I don’t have much fun when we spend time together. I find myself being happier when I spend time alone, and I feel like that’s a very important barometer for one’s overall happiness in a relationship. I then feel terrible for feeling this way, because I think I should just focus on her positives, make more effort to bridge our divides, etc. Problem is, I don't think I **want** to. 

**2)  Underappreciated/over-burdened.** I do nearly 100% of the work keeping our household functioning. We both have time-intensive parts of our lives (she’s nearly done with a PhD program, I have a job that’s based on completing projects rather than clocking in and out, so work can bleed into a lot of my time), but I’m the only one that does any domestic work on top of that. I do all of the grocery shopping, cooking, dishes, taking out the trash and recycling, picking up around the house, etc. Though she does pay nearly half of our bills, I’m the one that stays on top of all their due dates. We each do our own laundry. This situation might be okay if I felt some appreciation for what I do, but…nothing. I get thanked for cooking, but that’s about it. In every other respect I feel like a taken-for-granted domestic servant. Talks about this have resulted in promises to be better, with no follow-up action. If I don’t do these things, they simply don’t get done, and I can’t live like that. 

Financially, while she does pay half of most bills like I said, almost every other cost of living is paid for largely by me. I pay for everything related to our car (she refuses to drive, by choice, but is happy to be driven around when she needs to be). I pay for almost every major home-related purchase. Almost all the big-ticket items she uses regularly (laptop, nice camera, nice bicycle, etc) were paid for by me as birthday/Christmas gifts. She often bristles at being asked to pick up the check at restaurants. Admittedly, she’s on a (very generous) grad student stipend while I make a salary, and she always says that she needs to save now because academic job prospects are uncertain when she does finish her degree, but she’s managed to save a LOT more money in the bank than I have. Basically, I feel like her expectation is that she gets to strategically hedge her financial resources while I expend a greater proportion of mine supporting her/us. I don’t feel like I get any significant appreciation, or anything at all really, in exchange for this. 

**3) Attraction.** This is the one where I start to feel awful. I’m just not attracted to her anymore. We’re both in better shape than we were when we met, so it’s not like she’s let herself go. It’s more just…what I find attractive has changed, and I feel terrible about that. She’s not at all ‘girly’ – she doesn’t embrace signifiers of conventional femininity to any substantial degree. I found that attractive when I was 20, but at 30 it’s pretty much the complete opposite. I find myself wishing she were more feminine, that she were more into ‘looking good’ – she doesn’t really put much effort into her appearance, and I find it harder and harder to be attracted to her. This makes me feel awful, like I pulled some bait-and-switch on her, but…on the other hand, you can’t force yourself to be attracted to someone. And I’m just not attracted to her anymore. I don’t look at her and feel lust. I wish I did, but I just don’t. 

**Countervailing positives:** I know I’m focusing on the negatives here. It’s not all bad. She can be very sweet and kind, and she really likes me. She’s a genuinely good-hearted person, and she doesn’t deserve the pain that a breakup would cause her. That’s what gives me pause. 

**Conflicting thoughts:** when I really start to get down on our relationship, I feel terrible about myself. I feel like it should be my responsibility to communicate my needs better, to find things about her to be attracted to, etc. I think about how badly she would take a breakup – I just can’t imagine causing the pain that I’d see on her face as I walk out the door the last time. I often think that it’s better for me to be somewhat unhappy in this relationship than for her to be destroyed by me ending it. I don’t even know how to begin communicating how unhappy I am, because I don’t want to upset her. She’ll take it very poorly. About a year ago I started an “I’m unhappy” conversation, and she immediately started to take it very hard, so I basically chickened out and veered the conversation towards all the things I felt like I was doing wrong in the relationship, not her. I feel trapped. I can’t bear the thought of causing her pain, so I just soldier on, trying to be the best partner I can, but secretly wishing she’d choose to leave me so the relationship could end amicably. 

I get that I am the bad guy here. I’m conflict-avoidant to a fault, I’m preventing her from finding a partner who will love her more than I do by prolonging the relationship, I’m functionally lying to her by acting like everything’s fine. I am more at fault than she is, I get it. I’m asking for help in resolving this bad situation that I’ve caused. So if you’re planning on laying in to me, trust me, I get it – I’m at fault.

**TL;DR**: I’m unhappy in a 9-year relationship because I feel like we’ve grown apart, I’m under-appreciated for what I contribute, the burdens in the relationship are highly unequal, and I’m losing attraction. I do a poor job communicating these feelings because I don’t want to hurt her, which I understand is a terrible approach. Seeking advice on how to proceed.

I said I didn't want to hurt her and that the decision was up to her, but that I was unlikely to change my mind.

She said we shouldn't have sex because she wasn't that type of girl so I backed off and just started watching the movie we had on. She asked if I still wanted to have sex, and I just thought she had a change of heart so I went for it. We hung out a few more times, but it's only been about a week and a half at this point.

Immediately after she started texting me all day every day and snap  chatting me constantly. She calls me late at night drunk just to talk, and keeps recommending we do couple activities like taking walks through the city and going to visit friends of hers from high school. I ended up telling her it was getting too serious, and that we should stop hooking up because we want different things.

She was upset, and I said I still wanted to be friends and we could hang out casually every now and then without hooking up.

323,3a2n8f,"Our relationship - we've been together for 6 months, known each other for a year, and it has been amazing. We have great physical and emotional chemistry and nobody has made me laugh and feel as great as she makes me. No major fights just a couple of those new boundary conversations. We do not live together. I live alone with my cat and she lives with her parents to save money.

She was called a few days ago to be the co-pilot of a plane who's owner/operator needed one. She landed at her destination and like always, struck up conversations with the people at the airport. She often takes jobs like this, during a bar conversation or someone calling her because someone recommended her. I'm for that. She got an offer to work multiple dates for someone while at her destination, one being a co-pilot for a fairly famous band's tour in July. Then she said The only thing is he wants me 23-25 this month.......

My birthday is the 24th. It's my 30th, a milestone, and I want to spend it with her and my friends. I have spent the last two birthday's alone because I moved up to my current city for work and I didn't know a single person.

**Our conversation over text**

Her: The only thing is he wants me 23-25 this month........

Me: Ok

Her: We can talk though

Me: So it's really something you're entertaining?

Her: Well I told him I may not be able to cause of my other job, not wanting to say your birthday. But that trip gives us the time we need for me to get to know that airplane. It's such an amazing opportunity.

Me: and how do you think I feel about this?

Her: Like shit. And I hate doing this to you.

Me: and you told him maybe because you want to talk me into it.

Her: I just wanted to talk to you first. And to see his reaction about me not doing it.

Me: Ok

Her: It was either I tell him maybe and hope you support me and my career even though the timing is horrible or I make the decision without you. I wanted to include you in the conversation though.

Me: I do support you and your career. I expect the same consideration to support me and be there for me on the one day that should be off limits. This is my 30th birthday. This happens once.

Her: I'm sorry. I'll call him tomorrow and tell him I can't do those days but hope that we can still continue on the trip that starts the 30th. And I'll be home on the 3rd and 4th.

Me: Thank you

**30 minutes pass**

Me: This upsets me

Her: Me too. I never want to put you in this position but this is the reality of my job. I'm going to miss stuff.

Me: I just don't understand why you have to consider missing my 30th. I get that you have to go to places on a moment's whim but you owe nothing to this person that you just met. I feel like shit, I get i'll never be first in your life but this is low.

Her: I'm so sorry. You're right, I owe him nothing. But he offered me an amazing opportunity and if there was the slightest chance that you would say it's ok for me to go and me make it up to you, I had to ask. But that's me being selfish. It should have even been a question. I'm sorry.

At this point I told her I was going to be and that I would talk to her tomorrow.


A few things I take away from this. An apology is not an apology if it's followed by a but. She did this multiple times and her apologies or acknowledgments of crappy things don't feel genuine. She tried to manipulate me into thinking, if you don't support this one trip, you don't support my entire career or me. That one hurts. I've picked her up, told her it was alright that she missed a weekend when we had plans, listened to her, talked to her, etc.

I'm looking for advice and an unbiased set of ears (eyes in this case) so thank you for taking the time to read this.

8,3h9q7e,"Real quick, some background on us: barely knew each other before end of April, met up at end of semester party at a park, began talking right before I left, kept talking long after everyone else left until 4 am and made out. This was right before finals week. We continued to hang out with each other for about a week, then we became officially gf/bf. We were able to see each other almost every day throughout the 2 weeks before and during finals, staying the night at each others' places a few nights(no sex). She then went on a weeklong summer Christian group trip without any communication (they gave up their phones during that week), which sucked but we were fine. She came back for a few days in which I helped her pack and move her stuff before she headed home for the summer, while I would be at college for classes. 

We worked with the long distance, and it seemed okay for the first month. We texted everyday, and skyped every night or two. It seemed like we were okay. Problems seemed to pop up around June. She thought I wasn't making enough effort for our relationship, and while I was cutting back some, we still were talking everyday. An issue was she had no job or classes or anything taking up her time, buy I had 2 upper level classes and rotc work to do. She was coming to me anytime she was bored, but I had things to do. Also, she had problems with anxiety/depression, which I was willing to work with, and I wasnt able to be there for her when things weren't going well. It kept getting more strained through June, but we had planned for me to come up for 4th of July. I still went up to visit with her, but at the end of the trip, we sat down and talked about how things were really rocky between us, how maybe we took things too fast, pretty much skipping the getting-to-know-you stage and went straight to dating, and doing long distance after only 3 weeks in person may have been a bit risky. We mutually agreed to split. In my opinion, I thought she was a bit overly demanding of attention(she was definitely spoiled by her parents) but it wasn't something I would've broken up with her over, and I admit I could have done better with communication. It just seemed like we were together at the wrong time.

Fast forward to today, and we haven't talked since my trip home while I was at the airport. We were ok when we agreed to split, not hostile at all. We said we would be friends and maybe if things went well in the fall semester, we might get back together. But since we haven't talked since, I feel like we may have lost that opportunity to salvage anything. She just texted me pretty much asking how the rest of my summer has been. It feels strange beginning to talk to someone who, despite being closer to her in a matter of weeks than I was with almost anyone else, feels like a stranger. I have thought about us and how I want things to go. I would like to be friends, she was a nice girl, and being around her was fun, I enjoyed her company, but I don't feel like we wouldn't have a chance if we started dating again. I'm not sure if I want to date her again either, I have never really been one to go back to someone if you have spilt up before. 

I feel like I want to get back to being friends with her but I don't know if she thinks we are going to try to date again. And right now, I don't know if I would want to. I feel like I am overthinking this. I would talk to my buddy, but he isn't responding(very likely sleeping, he is usually good on talking to me about this stuff). If anyone has any advice, I would appreciate it, I need someone else's view on it.

I asked her to call me before bed to say goodnight. She said we could talk tomorrow. This bothered me because it was like she was choosing socializing over me.

Her side of it is that I am over controlling and she can't even have a night to herself. The main reason I was upset is she didn't tell me she would be busy. We are a LDR currently and I don't mind if she tells me she will be busy for a few hours. But when she doesn't tell me and then just brushes me off when I ask to talk to her it really upsets me.

It got to the point I said I was going to break up with her if she didn't call me. Which was a horribly wrong thing to say and was said out of anger. In the phonecall she pretty much just kept saying this this and this but.. or we'll see.

A few months back I was offered a promotion in my job but I would have to move to the west coast.  I decided that I cared about her enough that I would decline it if she had any feelings towards me, so I told her how I felt even though I felt like an ass for doing it while she was still in a relationship with somebody else.

Anyways, lately I have been missing her, wanting to talking to her and all that jazz, but I keep thinking if I should even text her and if I do, should I even try to get back with her. These feeling have been happening for about three weeks now.

When we broke up, it wasn't mutual, she didn't want to break up, I did. Although she was sad, she never cried and to be honest, I thought she was going to show more emotions. Maybe a tear came out but that was about it. She would keep texting me for about 2-3 weeks after we broke up telling me that she misses me and so on but i stayed with the no contact rule and did not text back because I did not want to lead her on or want her to keep thinking that there was still hope. After those few weeks, she stopped texting and we haven't had no type of contact, not even a word.

Our relationship was good. We enjoyed similar things and did not fight so much, just your petty arguments that were over in a day or two, never got into a huge argument. Sex life was good, nothing to complain. She was happy with me and I was happy, but again it wasn't perfect and I don't want to start discussing why I broke up with her. We never said we love each other even though we were together for a year and a half. These are just extra details that I don't know if they'll make a difference but I'll mention them. I was her first. We broke up for a few days during our relationship. In which I broke up with her and then after a couple of days, I couldn't stand the thought of being without her and I told her that I wanted to be with her again and we got back together. When we got together, both of us had just come out of a relationship. 

I have been thinking about it a lot. I haven't just given into my impulses of texting her without knowing exactly what I want because i do not want to text her and everything goes good and we get back together and just for us to break up after a couple of months. I want to make sure I know what I want. And the last thing I want is to hurt her again. I want to know that I'm in it for the long run. 

I think about it a lot. Sometimes I think, maybe all I want is sex, but the thing that contradicts that is that 1) I have gotten laid many times since we broke up. I would understand that if I hadn't then maybe thats all I would want, but its not. And 2) I know this is stupid but being a young guy sometimes I think with my dick instead of my mind, so, many guys say rub one out and think about the girl and if you still want her then you do like her and if you don't care anymore then you probably just want sex and I still think about her afterwards. To be honest if we did get back together, I wouldn't want to have sex with her yet. I would want to show her that I'm not just here for the sex and hold off on it.

I already look like a total douchebag for breaking up with her and now I want to be with her again. And I'm sure her family will not exactly welcome me with open arms and its something I'm willing to deal with too.

I have no idea what to do. The thing I'm scared of is being in a position of where things go well and we get together, just for in 3-4 months, for me to want to break up with her again. I feel at this point everyone is wondering what is going to be the problem or what was the problem and its because she's more on the introverted side and I'm not. She likes to stay in and watch a movie or read a book. I don't. I like to go out with my friends and drink and stuff but she doesn't. That was one of our bigger problems and a reason I broke up with her. And i don't want that to happen again where I'm inviting her to go out with me and my friends and she doesn't want to. She would say no, so many times and I got fed up with it. Apart from that, we got along well.

Should I even consider texting her and contacting her? And If yes, how should I even bring up this whole thing of wanting to get back with her? I know at this point, she is going to be the one to say yes or say no and she has the power.

293,2qidp4,"My fiancé and I have been dating for 3 years, and are planning to get married in June. He met “Laura” when they were in foster care together, and they're sort of like siblings.

Laura died five days ago, leaving behind her 11-month-old son. Laura specifically said she wanted custody to go to my fiancé. Months ago, Laura had sat us down and said she was rewriting her will now that her son was born, and she asked my fiance if he would mind being named as guardian in the event of her death. He/We accepted, but to be honest none of us thought it would be relevant. Of course, I don’t blame her for giving custody to my fiancé rather than both of us, since she’s much closer to my fiancé and it doesn’t make sense to give custody to two unmarried people in their twenties.

At the same time, I’m still pretty invested in this kid. Laura and I are friends on our own terms, and I was in the bathroom when Laura took the pregnancy test, FFS. But I’m also not really sure what my role is. I don’t want to overstep somehow. 

It’s a huge mess, and obviously we’ve just had Christmas so things have been crazy. 

My fiancée went out and bought some basic baby things and we brought him home last night. 

My mom is here at the moment but she and my dad live two hours away and my mom spends a lot of time and energy helping my eldest bro and SIL (who have two high-needs kids). It takes a lot out of my mom, and while she’s great as a parenting resource, she’s getting too old and exhausted to act as a childcare provider on a regular basis.

My fiancé spent the first few years of his life in an abusive home, and then a string of bad and so-so foster homes. He doesn’t have a lot of experience with good parenting, and he’s more than a little terrified at the moment.  Not to mention the fact that he is still grieving Laura. He got some parenting books and is listening to what my mom tells him to do but it seems to go deeper than that.

My fiancé works 55+ hours/week, and we haven’t really figured out how to handle that. He’s taking 2 weeks of leave but to be honest missing work is hard for him and he doesn't have the kind of job where it’s easy to work from home. I work fewer hours, and my workplace has on-site childcare, but we're not eligible until we’re married. 

Neither of us know what we’re doing, and my fiance very insecure and worried.

He’s a beautiful baby boy, but this whole thing is just a nightmare and I’m worried about my fiancé. Not to mention this poor little boy who just lost his mother.

I just graduated and moved back home where I will begin a full-time job next week. He is a grade below me so he still has his senior year left, 2 hours away at our college (also about 2 hrs away while on summer break). He's pre-med and applying to medical schools now (hopefully to be admitted for Fall 2015). He won't be applying to any too close to me. Some of the schools he's applying to are near cities, and I'd consider relocating if we lasted through to his college graduation.

As I haven't done this in awhile, I'm not really sure whats normal and what's not. I like being direct with people, but I know others don't necessarily do that. If she didn't want to hangout, would she have said so, or just never respond?

About two months ago Scott and I strted hanging out almost everyday. I've met his coworkers, bandmates, and even his Mom briefly

This is where things start to get weird. When we first started hanging out we were having sex 3-4 times a night. He would hold my hand in public and basically act like we're dating. As of recently we haven't been having sex. I haven't seen him in a week and a half. I've barely heard from him over the phone. He's blown me off maybe 4 times in the last week. 

I'm close friends with a girl he previously dated and I asked her how they broke up. She said he basically just stopped talking to her and that was it. He and I are very open about our previous relationships, so this kinda threw me off.

Now, he's very introverted and suffers from depression(which I just found out through his ex). I completely understand and I am more than happy to give him space when he needs it. I just need to know where I stand with him. We've agreed to be exclusive and I don't think he'd mess around with anyone else. I called him last Saturday and told him that I needed to speak with him. We're planning on meeting tonight(if he doesn't blow me off again), but I don't know what to say. I've assured him it's not serious(i.e. I'm not pregnant), but that I needed to speak to him. How do I approach this without coming off pushy or scary?

 I should also mention that his other previous SO really fucked with his head. Cheated on him multiple times in his own bed. I've tried bringing this up before and he keeps saying that we're adults, he wants to take it too slow, etc. How slow is too slow though?

I know that I'm her type as we've talked about this before when we were just friends.

Recently she told me that she's also been dating someone else, and she thinks she has more chemistry with him than me. I asked her what chemistry was to her, as I've always thought chemistry was what we had, like I said above and she told me she can't explain it. So I ask her things like does she have better conversations with this other guy, and she says no, they have a lot of awkward silences. I then ask her what is it that she likes about him better than me and she can't name anything.

So right now I'm pretty confused.

Now I'm kinda at a crossroads. I miss her a lot; I miss our relationship, and I miss how we got along. I know there were things that made me want to leave, but for the most part, my anxiety was like a barrier that held me back from giving myself fully to her. I'd constantly worry about if the relationship was right for me, and had only one foot in the pool, so to speak. 

So I want to tell her all this and say that I want to recommit myself to her, explain myself and how I'm feeling and ask if she wants to give it another go. 

I'm also okay with being friends. Thing is, I'll need some time to get over her. I think a friendship with her could be a very good thing, but right now it pains me to think of her dating other guys, and I'm not yet used to relating as friends and not partners. So I know I need some space.

Hello there all.

Now before I begin here, I would like to inform you that I am not some raging teen spitting disrespectful things on the internet about my parents.  This is a legitimate concern and I truly need your help, reddit.

This all started to happen a few years back in my freshman year of high school.  My school life was going well, and I had straight A's with all honors and I was beginning to blossom as a violinist.  All was going well, and never would I have imagined what was to follow in the future.  

My mother was always strict in her disciplining but I started to realize that since 7th grade when I had my first major grade drop (C's and D's for some grades in major subjects), she would try to control and discipline me through her anger.  Shouting and belittling language (such as, You're dumb, and, You must be stupid not to do this) was beginning to be thrown around.  From that time I was beginning to feel unsatisfied with my relationship with my mother because she could not be pacified by any means.

Coming back to my freshman year, I started to really get into an online game about halfway into the year, and I started to sacrifice my night time sleep for it.  The way I was able to do this without friction with my mother originally was because my parents were divorced, and I was able to indulge as long as I wished at my father's house.   It was an addiction since the very start, but I found it a great method to alleviate the stress that was put onto me by a perfectionist mother.  

My mother eventually caught onto what I was doing and beginning then, from the summer after my freshman year, started to battle urge to fill my emotional voids with videogames with anger, shouting, and a refusal to heal through embracing and understanding.  The frequency of belittling language, extremely strict lectures that I was forced to listen to, and verbal punishment became extremely common.  Around then I was becoming lost.  I did not know what to do.  I needed to play games but then my mother would spit her firey wrath.  If I forfeited games, then I was afraid that I would psychologically break.

At first, the were no noticeable effects of her increased use of belittling language and verbal punishments on myself.  I just brute forced my way through them and at least try to understand them because I knew that it was for my own good, and that it is hard being a parent, especially a middle class parent with multiple children.

Entering tenth grade, the start line was looking good, but then my game addiction essentially ruined around 3/4 of my school years worth of grades.  The verbal punishment directed towards me was ramped up even more, and it was around then that I started to notice that I was becoming a little... different.

I was starting to lose my self esteem.  I felt useless.  I felt as if I was a burden to society.  I started having feelings that not many people liked me.  My stress was also starting to break me down physically with the combination of sleep deprivation that I would get from playing games to alleviate that stress (ironically).  I was becoming physically weak, with low endurance and I was beginning to weigh less and less each month.  

During this entire descent to hell physically and mentally, my mother continued her policy of verbal punishment and harsh, criticizing language all throughout it, and that only accelerated my fall.  This caused her to become controlling, and I started to lose my privileges just as quickly as my overall health was declining.

In my junior year of high school I started to dig myself out of that hole with relatively positive results.  I started to brush off the dust that had accumulated on me through a whole year of mistreating myself and my grades took large turn for the better.  

This however, did not change my mothers persistent parenting tactic of using anger to control me.  

I had years prior to my senior year won awards as a violinist, and my junior year I was starting to become a pretty legitimate violinist as well as a strong chess player, and I won a handful of awards. 

What was damaging to me through my observations is that my mother seemed to value me through my accolades, and not through who I am, my own unique self.  It was beginning then that I started to have suicidal thoughts... monthly.  My self esteem just worsened even more despite success cleaning myself up throughout the year and I began to feel darkness beginning to taint myself.  As a result, I became sour and cynical with my demeanor and I was feeling sad almost always inside.

Entering my senior year this year, I am certain that there is no doubt that my efforts in school have shown.  Last year I had taken 2 AP classes and got 4's on both exams, and this year I am taking 4 AP classes (I know I know it's not a lot) with a great record of 6 consecutive years in my region's honor orchestra, and 2 years in my state's All-State Orchestra, as well as numerous awards awards in violin, and chess, as well as a GPA that is not bad thanks to my kick ass freshman grades and my pretty good junior years grades.  I volunteer to teach chess, am an expert swordsman, and educated in computer science.  I felt that I was a well rounded student, but all of this apparently is still not enough to quiet my mother's verbal punishment and controlling nature (such as telling me what to do for almost anything and keeping an eye over me almost all times around me, which lead to multiple breaches of what I consider basic privacy, such as being able to close the door to your own room.  Also, she almost always insists upon her suggestions on most decisions and very rarely even considers mine despite mine many times being logically more acceptable

Now that college is one year away, my mother is dumping stress over me by comparing me to others whom she sees more successful or more hard driven when I as an individual have accomplished much, much more than she had ever during her years in secondary school and surpassed many, many people in my grade in academics and intellectual pursuits.  

As a result I am now tired, almost constantly sad, have very low confidence and self esteem, and have suicidal thoughts at least once very month, since the only way it seems that I can escape this environment, since I am a minor, is through death.  I am not sure I can endure much verbal punishment and belittling language from my mother beyond my high school years and for now I have resorted to considering cutting off contact with my mother during my one or maybe more years while I am in college.  I just don't think I can fix this crazy parenting strategy of my mother's and I cannot trust that she will relieve it when I depart for the outer world.  I need time to develop myself as a person, to live by my own system, and to spiritually cleanse myself without a domineering perfectionist using brute force tactics to try to mold me into the ideal person, although I am uneasy about this since this violates the ethics of many, including myself to some extent.  

At this point I am simply lost and I am not very sure what to do myself, and I simply desperate for help. 

Help and suggestions are greatly appreciated, and I hope that those who stumble across this thread with similar problems may be enlightened by reddit knowledge.

1203,2i4wqu,"Some time ago, around a year or two, my girlfriend and I nearly ended things because she was doubtful about our relationship. Admittedly, many of the issues then were my own doing and I worked hard to fix them. However, during our troubled period she had been in contact with a co-worker and admitted to being interested in a romance with him. We patched things up and I asked her to break contact with him as I was uncomfortable with her being in contact with someone who would seek romantic relations with someone in a relationship.

Since then she made a new friend with the same name who seemed awfully familiar awfully fast. I was naive, painfully so, and believed this to be a new person. It was revealed to me two night ago that it was not. She says about a year went by where she had zero contact with him but over time she missed the friendship and they reconnected about six months ago, during which time she has been actively lying to me about this person. 

I'm torn on how to best handle this. My instinct is to insist she break contact again. I'm painfully suspicious of this man, regardless of her assurances that they are just friends. However, I don't know that my asking will have any effect, considering that she was willing to keep it from me for so long. Am I in the right to ask her to do this? Or was my asking her to break contact the wrong thing the whole time?

Update:: Thank you all for your responses, they've helped to make things clearer. I was wallowing between the two choices out of a need to do what I need to but not make her unhappy. I've told her no more contact. She intends to send him one message to explain the situation, but on the understanding that I'm there when she does so. She's been forthcoming and earnest to fix things and I'm looking forward to getting back on the right track, though with eyes a touch more open, I think.

I say 'we both seem' because I don't know what he's feeling or thinking now. While his actions and interest in me back up everything we've discussed and agreed upon (monogamous relationship), this past weekend changed how I perceive his interest.


We were at dinner saturday night and he was very into/excited about a conversation he was having via text with this girl. By now I know all his friends, and the names of some he no longer keeps in touch with. I had never heard this girl's name mentioned before, and the whole situation made me very uncomfortable. But whatever, 4 months doesn't give you all the info on someone.


The next morning I acted upon paranoia and bad memories from my last relationship, which ended 4 years ago after my bf at the time repeatedly sought out other girls. I looked at his texts due to this paranoia of being hurt in such a manner again, and it wasn't exactly his convo with this girl that got me, but the one he had with his best friend (F) about this girl.


I'm going to break down what I read and then what he and I talked about in the order in which it happened the other day, for ease of organization. 


Texts with the new girl: 
The night prior to us being at dinner he had texted this new girl, with a little random memory like 'hey stranger drink any whiskey lately'. There were very few texts exchanged that night, but he did ask if she'd be down to get a drink sometime and she said yes. The night we were at dinner she had texted him first with a random quizzo type question. I literally thought he had a friend at quizzo when he read me the text. They continued exchanging facts about or names of interesting animals, and the entire convo was pretty benign, like the non important banter you would have with a friend. 

He and I spend hours exchanging bits of knowledge we have, and this has included animals, so the fact that he has a friend who does the same didn't really bother me. Didn't seem out of the ordinary. It was the fact that he was more into that convo than my company that bothered me. That's why after looking at their convo, I looked at recent texts exchanged with his friend next.


Convo between him and his best friend (F):
Friday night (the night before we were at dinner) he asked his friend if this new girl's number 'was still the same'. He said he was nervous to text her since she's attractive, and he'd feel bad talking to another girl right now. His friend said a little friendly remark wouldn't hurt. After the new girl answered his initial text, he texted his friend with 'omg she answered!' then 'She said she'd get a drink. I'm all like &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3'.
His friend just said yay or that's good, and they didn't say anything else about it the rest of the night or on Saturday.

I was livid and heartbroken when I read that. I felt and still feel like complete shit that I looked at his phone, but I feel somewhat validated since his convo with his friend was him being excited about talking to her again. I did not want to let it out that I looked at his phone, but had such a hard time figuring out how to talk to him about this. Essentially I point blank asked him if he wanted to continue this, or pursue other girls. He said of course he wants to be with me, to which I said 'You know, I have a bad feeling about your convo with 'new girl' last night. You seemed more into that convo than being with me.' He got angry that I didn't say something that night, and I said I was curious as to where she came from since he hadn't mentioned her before.


According to him, they had been on one awkward date a year ago, which I'm fairly certain was facilitated by his best friend. The girl was just starting to see someone else at that time, so they never kept in contact or saw each other again. He said that she recently became single and was asking his friend about him. So his friend, who knows he is involved with me, provided him this info, and he decided to contact her.


I told him I didn't appreciate him reaching out to her under those circumstances. To me, that is both of them picking up unfinished business. He was adamant that he was not interested in her romantically, and wants me and him to work. I said we aren't going to work if he acts upon this or he communicates with her under that pretense. 

Despite this convo and him not talking to her the rest of our weekend together, I am pretty sure I know where this is going. We also have not yet officially declared each other boyfriend and girlfriend, but early on we established that neither of us care for labels and that agreeing to only see each other was all that we needed to confirm we were dating. Everything has been great aside from a few disagreements that we've worked through, so I never thought to question where he stood. However, I now almost feel as though he uses being a 'label-less' couple as an easy way to not have to think he's in a relationship or tell someone else he is in one.

Now, I don't know if I want to take this one instance and break it off. He didn't set a date to see her, so I feel as though I should take his word about us wanting to work but keep an eye on him. I do not believe I'm overreacting in thinking he has intentions to see her given his convo with his best friend, however, I still can't prove anything until he actually sees her.

So, am I essentially answering my own questions as to what to do? break it off now or wait and see if he is true to his word?

1040,2m9pmk,"I'm going to start by saying that I feel like a huge, selfish, slimy bastard right now. Probably because I am. There are 2 really wonderful girls in my life and I deserve neither of them. 

Let me start by describing my long-term girlfriend, who I shall call Ann here. I've been with Ann for 5 years and our relationship started because I really admired her. Ann was everything I was not. She had this natural charisma and was filled with passion and drive. She cared deeply for those around her, especially her family. She was artistic and creative. I would say she still is. 

And she also seemed to admire me for the traits she did not have. I know we have our differences, in everything from character to interests, but we worked on it and have been able to make it work. I've even proposed and we're getting married soon. 

Then there's a new girl I've barely known for 3 months. Let's call her Beth. She's a new colleague at work. And if I were to be honest, I still barely know her, but we just operate on the same wavelength. We also have far more in common than I do with Ann. And we started talking. A lot. We could talk non-stop and still feel like it's not enough. I felt a kind of chemistry with Beth that I never had with Ann. 

And it scared me. I knew that if I allowed it to grow I would not be able to contain it. Both Beth and I were in long-term relationships and I did not think it would go anywhere. But I didn't want to give our friendship up. I just wanted it to be safe. I told Beth that she was like a long-lost sister to me. 

But Beth didn't accept that. She told me she felt a special connection between us, something she feels she had not found before and would not find again for life. She did not want to just give it up without saying anything to anyone. I told her that I'm sorry, and that I had nothing to give her. I kept a distance between us and she respected it. Since then, our interaction became much more limited, with most of it happening when we went out with a rather large groups of friends from my workplace.

Despite all this, however, the emotional impact it had on me was very real, because I could understand what she was saying. I've never felt a connection with anyone similar to what I felt with Beth. And I couldn't keep it to myself. I confessed to Ann about it because of how guilty I felt. Not really the special connection thing, but that a colleague developed feelings for me. I'm not sure what I was expecting. Perhaps forgiveness? But that was just my own selfishness. Ann started having trouble trusting me, and I don't blame her. It was my fault after all. 

This all came to a boil when I wanted to go watch a movie with my colleagues. Beth would be there. I told Ann about it and again tried to assure her that there was no longer anything going on between Beth and I. I even told her that she could come along. She told me she would allow me to go, but that it would make her feel emotionally insecure. That I was not to talk to Beth. Being stupid, I told Ann it's a large group and that interacting within the group meant talking to Beth. Ann got more emotional and started blaming me. I asked her if I could not even have Beth as a friend. 

Ann then issued me an ultimatum. If I wanted Beth as a friend, she would leave me. I begged her to reconsider but she would not have it. At the time, my contact with Beth had already been rather limited but it still felt wrong somehow. I wanted Ann to change her mind. But it didn't happen. 

I ended up texting Beth at 3am that we couldn't be friends any more. But as I did that, I felt something in me die. Something in my life just felt wrong now. I sent a screenshot of my message to Beth to Ann, then told her that I can't continue my relationship with her either. That I'm sorry for all that I've done and that she would be happier with someone else who she could trust. 

Beth's reply came first. She was obviously hurt and confused but told me that she could feel how heartbroken I was. She said that she had been willing to hold herself back from talking to me all this time because she thought it would make my life easier and happier. And that since it was not the case she would not leave me alone anymore. I told her I still had nothing to give to her, that I would only cause her pain and grief. She said she had no expectations of me, but that she would not just leave me be.

Then came Ann's reply. She told me she was sorry. She didn't mean it. That she still loved me and was just afraid to lose me. That she wanted to start again with me. That the only reason she had issued an ultimatum was because she wanted me to see the importance of our relationship. She wanted me to take back what I had said. She told me that she would try her best to build an even better relationships with me. I told her that I couldn't just take back what I said because it was important to me. That she shouldn't have issued an ultimatum which she had no intention of following through. But that I would try to love her again. 

Since that day I had been talking with Beth again while trying to make things go back to the way it was with Ann. Ann in particular started trying really hard. She started picking up some of my interests which she did not have before. She tried doing more for us. All this even though the person who made a mistake was me. She was willing to forgive me now. As for Beth, well, she had apparently broken off her relationship with her long-term boyfriend when we weren't talking much. She doesn't say it again but I know that I'm not simply another friend to her.

And if I continue on as I am doing now I would just be cheating on both of them. And they don't deserve this. Both of them are truly wonderful girls who deserve someone who would treat them right. And now I truly have to choose. My head tells me that I should stick with Ann. We've had such a long relationship and had been looking at happily ever after. And the things she is trying now really touches me precisely because I know she is doing it only for me. But my heart wants to go with Beth. When we started talking again I realised how much I had missed it and how much I had missed her. And the things Ann tries so hard to do just comes naturally to her. 

The last choice, which is the one I'm leaning towards, is that I will choose neither. I can't go on with Ann now because my heart really isn't in it any more. I know leaving her would hurt her, but if I didn't I think I would eventually hurt her more. And I can't start a new relationship with Beth now because then I would just be letting her clean up the emotional mess that I have left myself in. I would need to start talking less to her again because if I just keep talking to her like I am doing now I'm just leading her on. 

I know this is a really long, rambling post so for anyone who had made it all the way here, thank you. I know all this is really juvenile and I feel really stupid about it, considering how old I already am. But any advice would still be great. Thank you.

535,3fu9l3,"My name is Neve and I live in Texas and my boyfriend lives in Georgia.

I met this guy online around mid-January. I was in a relationship at the time that was very unhealthy and abusive and Bobby, my current boyfriend, helped me through the tough times I was going through with my ex. 

Finally I ended things with Justin, my ex, and moved onto Bobby because he treated me so special. He told me ever since he saw me he knew I was the one. He's bought me so many things and I haaaaate when men buy me things because I'm more of an emotional person than a materialistic kind of girl. But he bought me a 4,000 dollar ring (he's wealthy) because he said he was for sure that we're going to get married.

A lot of people I tell about our story disapprove of the relationship because they think the way we handle it is creepy since we fell so hard so fast. 

Anyway, we've been planning to meet for a while but he had work and school and his probation officer to deal with so I waited. 
Last month, he comes and visits me. 
I hid it from my family because they're racist and he's black and I'm white and they're against the whole interracial thing which is a whole other story. But anyway, he comes and visits me.

We have the best of time, we connected and it felt so real. I completely felt his love. With my exes, I manipulated myself into believing they loved me but I actually felt it and even feel it as I'm writing this. We spent four days together. The first day, July 4th, we were together from 6pm to 8am just walking around together. We went to a hotel but you had to be 21 and neither of us were, obviously.

After that, we just stayed out there trying to get ahold of a cab but since it was the Fourth of July, no one picked up or was available. 

Blah, blah, blah, he lost his Visa card that night so he didn't have a place to stay because he had no money. He slept on my porch and in my backyard because I was so concerned for him even though just THAT would risk me being able to see him.

The day he left, we sat and cried. I wasn't the first to cry. He was quiet that day and I was kinda getting mad at him for not talking to me but then he put his head down on his knees and I saw a tear fall onto his jeans and then we both just lost it. 

When he got home, we talked every day on the phone, through text, etc. Then two weeks ago, he stopped responding and I was like um wtf. I texted him things like um wtf why aren't you responding??? and he never read or replied to them. I finally got kind of nervous so I called him.

A woman answered. 

Then I jumped straight to the conclusion that he was cheating on me and other bullshit like that but then she said This is Bob's mom. Bob got arrested. 

My heart dropped because I knew he was staying clean and sober and I thought he was seeing his probo, but apparently not. 

I've been talking to his mom every day since then and finally last week I got to speak to him on the phone. His mom did a three-way call and it was really emotional and he said he just focused too much on me and i told him he needs to shape up and get his priorities straight because he was supposed to move here in the near future. Now, that plan is obviously hindered. 

He's still not out and I've gone into a deep depression, self-destructing and whatnot. I've tried to keep happy but I really just can't without him.

I'm a little upset right now, so if any of this didn't make sense I apologize.

Basically my question and **TLDR** is, what are your thoughts on my relationship with a man who is in another state and is now in jail?

542,39guwo,"Hey guys. So, I just wanted some quick advice. I've been dating an amazing girl for 7 months. She has all the traits I've ever wanted in a girlfriend. After being cheated on in High School, I was very hesitant to get back in a relationship. However, it was easy with her.

We started dating 2 weeks after we met. There was no awkward first date to see if their was feelings and than a kiss after. The way I knew she liked me was us making out in my room. We dated for 3 weeks and then began our relationship. We recently just went past 7 months and I'm loving every second of it. I fell hard for this girl. Way harder than I wanted too. There's just a couple problems, and these problems are making me consider breaking up with her.

Before we started dating, she was in a relationship with a guy for 3 years. Someone who she admits she saw herself marrying one day. They went to college 3 hours away from each other, but they made it work. One day, he just dumped her over text. Obviously upset, she drove up to see him. According to her, they barely talked. He gave a couple reasons, and that was that. She was devastated. We started dating 6 months after that. She said she wasn't looking for someone either when she met me. However, like me, she just said it was easy. However, she still clearly not over it. Even after an entire year and some change, she's not over it. She just doesn't have any closure. Myself and many of her friends have told her to talk to him, but she's scared to do so. She doesn't want her old feelings for him to show up and for me to get hurt. I don't think this would happen though, because she's told me she doesn't have any feelings for him.

The last couple of months, this whole issue with her ex has been a problem. But it hasn't just been about him and not going to talk to him, it has been about how she changed after that. It affected how she treated relationships in general. Now, I'll preface this by saying yes, we do both love each other. The issue is that it is obvious I love her more than she loves me. We've both told the other about this. As a result, I see more in her than she sees in me. I can honestly say this is someone I could see myself marrying one day. She on the other hand couldn't say that. She said it's because she can't make plans for the future. She did once, and she got majorly hurt. I understand that, but I would think she could see some sort of future with me. Now, when I say I could see myself marrying her, that doesn't mean I actually want to marry her. There's alot in my life I want/need to do before I settle down. It just worries me that she can't see any future with me.

And then, the part that worries me most. We were talking about this issue of myself loving her than she loves me and she told me this gem. She told me that it wasn't me that was the problem. That I am literally everything she's ever wanted in a boyfriend (even listed them off). It's just she doesn't feel that right now. She wants too, but she can't. This definitely concerned me alot. I've always thought if the feelings aren't there, they just aren't there. I wouldn't want her to 'try' to get feelings for me. They should come naturally.

So, I was thinking of breaking up with her. Not only to help myself, but help her as well. Just to kinda ease the feelings away and not get more her by spending more time together. I don't know if I'm overreacting and just need to be more patient and wait, or if this is a real problem. My friends aren't very helpful, but I figured you lot might be. If there are any questions, feel free to ask and I'll give the best response possible. Thanks!

1024,3co35n,"Hi Reddit, I'm sorry I'm using a throwaway but I know couple of my friends are also on this subreddit.

So I'm having this kind of an issue. I have this very good friend, who's actually a lovely guy, he's smart, kind funny and sweet. For ages he was having a crush on me but I had a boyfriend. When I split with my ex I spent some time by myself, and eventually we started going out. 

We had dinner together,  and we had some wine and we kissed and everything was going great, until we did end up in bed. 
I'm not picky or anything, but a)he has a very very tiny penis (which we couldn't even get up) b)he's got no experience whatsoever . The experience part is not such a problem, one learns. But the other part is what is killing me.


I'm this kind of woman who likes sex a lot, and I've always been having boyfriends I had LOTS of sex with. 
I can't even almost imagine having a relationship without this kind of sex and so on, and I feel really shallow for feeling this way, and I feel cruel almost, but it's three days I'm obsessing over the fact that if we really are together, then I'll have to completely change my sexual habits, which I really don't know if I'm willing to do?(and I keep thinking the only time I cheated on a boyfriend was for this reason(=I was sexually unsatisfied) although I have to say to my defense that I confessed the very next day and left him).

Moreover, we were going out together on a very tight group of friends, and now this happened just once, but if I suddenly withdraw I'm going to separate the group of friends and everybody will hate me. Not to mention that I'm going to seriously hurt him, and seriously, he's such a lovely and kind person, and this makes me feel like crap, honestly.
But I'm just thinking and thinking and could I be living without actually feeling anything during sex and I don't think I can, but then on the other hand it is better to have a lovely boyfriend and no sex than a shitty boyfriend with good sex, and then I'm obsessing there must be guys who are both?

I am so confused, maybe some of you can comment on the situation, because me myself I am just going nuts over this issue.

I'm just thinking there is no easy way out of this, and if I could just pack my bags and run away I probably would, but its impossible for me to go anywhere as I'm in the middle of uni right now. 

tldr: had sex with a good friend, looks like we're not compatible in bed. Don't know what to do, panicking.

I've known he had some sort of feelings for me for quite a while, I was able to ignore it and keep acting like I didn't see it, but it's becoming more and more obvious, and it's starting to get awkward, it's starting to annoy me too. 

He's an extremely nice guy, wouldn't hurt anyone, he's overprotective, and he looks at me with eyes that screams  I love you. I like him as a friend, we have great talks, but it's starting to annoy me, and I feel bad all the time. 

Yesterday we went to a club with other friends, I was pretty drunk, he didn't even try to do anything with me ( thank god! He's kind of good looking ( I mean, he's not incredibly hot, but he's not ugly either) , but he just sucks with girls.) he kept following me around making sure I wasn't getting into trouble, I'm a mess but don't want or need someone to protect me like that.

We were both sleeping at a friends appartment, but I left in the middle of the night to join my fuckbuddy, which I almost didn't do because I didn't want to hurt him. This morning when I came back, I felt super guilty, he looked so disappointed, he wasn't mad at me or anything, but I could tell he wasn't ok with this.

He's not straight forward, I know he won't tell me, how do I tell him I'm not interested in him that way ? 
I don't wanna make it too awkward, we hang out with the same people, I also don't wanna hurt him, I know he doesn't have much luck when it comes to relationships ( I feel like he's always friendzoned )

At first I was with him a lot because I liked his company, it was selfish of me to do this, I was too friendly, but now, it has gotten to a point where I can't even stand him anymore because it makes me feel too guilty. I don't even answer his texts anymore because I don't wanna give him anymore false hopes. I hate to hurt people. It usually feels good to know someone likes you, but now it makes me feel horrible.

How do I approach this ?  Do you think it's ok to directly ask him if he sees me as more than just a friend ?

41,1ls07e,"So my friend is dating her first real boyfriend, they've been dating just over a year and are quite close. Do most everything together, spending all day with one another, going places. They live in towns 50km from one another, so it impacts her social life with her other friends dramatically.

Now whenever my friend and I plan a weekend together her boyfriend becomes ridiculously jealous. This happened the other weekend where me and my other [18F] friend organized a night out to the movies then staying at my house for a night. He ended up making her cancel her plans because he believed me or my other friend (who i'll call F) would come onto her (I'm rather bi, swinging to girls and F has short hair and wears flannelette shirts a lot) and she's not allowed to stay over because he's jealous. 

Me and F just became disappointed, watched the movie with G and then she left after her boyfriend came to pick her up. We ended up spending the night together &amp; watching movies, etc.

Now another night we went out to an event at a bar and had a few drinks together with her boyfriend there too. We got quite drunk and a few of our friends left until it was just me, G, F &amp; her boyfriend. We chatted as we usually would when it was just F, G and I, chatting shit and gossiping a little. Whenever G talked, his eyes would focus on her like he wanted her to stop. When it was me, the same thing happened. He talked a little bit but he didn't really join in much. 

G &amp; I have both tried adding her boyfriend to facebook and he hasn't accepted either of our friend requests. Now the other morning I went over to F's house and her boyfriend had slept at her house. The whole time he would talk to me whenever I looked at F, or talked to her. He'd interrupt me and make me talk to him. It's like he doesn't want his girlfriend having friends.

I don't know how to deal with this, I've nearly stopped hanging out with F recently because whenever she tells him of how she did X with me, he tells her of how I shouldn't be doing so much with me.

I've known her for 6 months or so and G has known her for about 10 months. 

TL;DR: Friends boyfriend gets ridiculously jealous in situations he shouldn't, I feel it's not my place to say anything so I don't. He's recently gotten worse and I'm starting to feel like I don't want to be around her due to her boyfriends jealousy. I'd like advice on how to make it so I don't want to stop being around her.

1151,1vkg8d,"**The Background**

To begin with, I love my family very much.  I grew up in a fundamentalist Christian household in which my parents did their best to isolate us from the  evils of the real world.  I am the oldest of nine children, three girls and six boys.  During the entire time I was living at home, my mom was either pregnant or nursing.  In addition, we were all home-schooled from elementary school through high school graduation, and my six siblings still young enough to live at home continue to be home-schooled to this day.  Throughout my growing up, I had contact with few other children my age since we lived far in the country and all my activities outside the house were primarily solitary (i.e. piano lessons).  Although my parents have become more lenient over time, I was forced to dress modestly growing up and was teased for it throughout my adolescence until I refused to interact with the few children my age I did come into contact with.  All in all, I was very lonely when I lived at home and jumped at my chance to attend college away from home.

My mother (F53) runs the family, and my dad stands by as a passive observer most of the time.  If he dared to do anything else, I'm not sure my parents would still be married today (despite the fact that they don't believe in divorce).  My mom's relationship with the other individuals in my family is rocky at best, and when I interacted with her more, our relationship was especially rough.  As the oldest child and the most responsible, I was often the target for her disapproval, and as I grew older, I refused to back down from her more and more often.  She would often tell me that she thought that I was stupid and that she didn't know who would ever want to marry me because I was so difficult.  She would joke to her friends about how I was the difficult child and about how strict she had to be with me.  Once, in a fit of rage, she threw a chair at me; however, she never physically abused me.  In fact, she often prefers to manipulate us either with tears or by being passive aggressive, and she often shrinks from direct confrontation.  

The three of us siblings who have left the house have either adhered closely to the strict moral and religious code set by our parents (my brother) or have been plagued with depression and anxiety (my sister and I).  By and large, my issues are minor; I have social anxiety and find it difficult to talk to people, even those I already know.  In fact, sometimes I have difficulty leaving my apartment because the thought of seeing people is so overwhelming.  My sister's issues are worse: she was hospitalized last summer for attempted suicide, is currently undergoing counseling, and takes antidepressants.  

I currently live a nine hour drive from my parents' home, have received my masters degree, and work a decent-paying job.  For the most part, I rarely talk to my family since my mother cries if I talk to another family member without talking to her and sometimes speaking with her can be unpleasant.  She criticizes all of my life choices and tries to guilt me into doing what she wants.  For example, she is currently trying to get me to move back to my hometown and change my career path by telling me that my younger siblings aren't going to remember me, that I need to be a role model for them, and that I can't possibly be fulfilled by what I am currently doing.  

**The Current Situation**

I have been dating my boyfriend for more than a year and a half now.  He is my first relationship of any kind.  To say the least, he is not parent-approved.  He has less education than me, is of a different race, and identifies as an atheist.  (For what it's worth, I also no longer consider myself a Christian but have not revealed this fact to my mom.) However, he is simply an awesome person, and I love him.  Currently, we are long-distance while he finishes up some schooling necessary for his career, but we are very much in love with each other, and he plans to move to me when he is done with his schooling.  At the beginning of our relationship, I gave my boyfriend a brief rundown of my family and warned him that he would never be approved by my parents and that I probably would not tell them about him unless our relationship became serious.  He was initially fine with this, but as time went on, he became impatient for me to just get the introductions over with.  

Last summer, my brother got married, and I thought the wedding might be an appropriate time to introduce my family to my boyfriend.  I asked my brother if he was all right with me bringing a date to the wedding and then informed my parents that I was dating someone who they would get to meet soon.  My mom asked me if he was Christian, and I said that he was not.  At the time she didn't push the issue.

The wedding went well, but after I returned home, I received a facebook message from her telling me that this was not the man God had for me and that I should use the amazing mind God had blessed me with to find someone else.  She also told me that I was settling because I was old and panicking (not true!).  In response, I told her that I appreciated her concern but that I was not dating my boyfriend because I was feeling too old and that I loved him.  She did not reply.

Since that time nearly six month ago, my mom has not acknowledged my relationship with my boyfriend at all, even in passing.  It's like my boyfriend doesn't exist to her and never did.  However, I have heard from my siblings that she is gossiping about me to extended family and family friends behind my back, telling them that I am a terrible person and that I don't love my family.  I have no idea what to do.  I don't want to fight with her, so I'm hesitant to bring up my boyfriend with her again.  However, I do want her to know that ignoring the situation won't make it go away.

As a few additional notes, my boyfriend and I are getting more and more serious, and I need my mom to start taking me seriously.  However, I am afraid she will cut me off completely, and I really, really don't want to lose contact with my youngest siblings.  Therefore, I want to be firm but still as non-confrontational as possible.  I'm a big girl and can stand up for myself, but based on her current reaction, I simply don't know how to approach the issue.

- We're best friends (like, we literally spend all day together) who can be silly but also have 'deep' moments.


- We met on the first day of move in (we're college freshmen currently) and have been inseparable since. Everyone assumes we're dating or hooking up because we're always together... I go to every party with him, we spend all our free time together, sometimes sleep over after nights out on the weekends, study together, eat together. Basically, if you see one of us you can  safely assume the other is there too.


- he's always been a little flirt with pretty much everyone and he describes himself as a touchy-feely person so I never assumed anything.


- We've made out but only while really really drunk.


- lately he's been even more touchy/flirtatious, like kissing my cheek/neck/hand and stroking my arm, grabbing my ass, touching my boobs, tickling, picking me up, etc


- more sex talk (casual talk about what we've done etc)


- any of the flirtatious touching is only in private. he doesn't like other people to walk in on us

- from what i've collected, im not at all his type physically

- hes still hooking up with other people - I feel like he's using me a little as a source of positive attention. I dunno what to make of this. I've never had my best friend be a guy. I don't know how they think.

The first two times we kissed is because we were at a party and I tripped and fell back onto a couch and he fell on top of me and kissed me. I've only gone for it once (I was completely blackout drunk, I don't remember this at all. He told me this is what happened) and he was like You were all over me etc etc and he sounded like he didn't like it. That was before he started getting more touchy with his flirting, though. So I don't know.


Honestly, I don't know what I want. I do know what I don't want, though. I don't want anything casual or fwb. I've done that too much and I'm sick of it. I want a boyfriend sort of thing and I feel like he doesn't like me, he just likes flirting and the attention. He walks away feeling good about it because he gets my attention and also is hooking up with someone. I get this attention and then am left hanging so to speak. People think I'm in a relationship or whatever and don't want to flirt with me so I don't get to meet people who actually like me.


He will call me pretty and cute and stuff but I definitely feel like its jokingly. Especially since he comments on other girls' looks. I know what his preferences are and I'm not it.

1126,36mzo2,"Full story: In November my girlfriend of a little under two years broke up with me, and I've been having a tough time getting back on my feet ever since. I'll preface this by saying I've been in a decent amount of relationships since high school, the longest of which being three years, and I've never had a breakup affect me like this. 

I started dating (whom we'll call) Kate right before my last semester of college. I was dating a different girl (the three year relationship) and we were getting set to move down South where she grew up after graduation, where we had a house and jobs lined up. Long story short, I was starting to feel like things between her and I were getting sort of flat and starting to second guess if I wanted to commit to having that future with her, so when Kate came along it really started to make me question what I wanted in a relationship and what I wanted for myself.

Kate and I worked together at a grocery store. She was in an emotionally and physically abusive relationship, and we became friends and talked a lot about what love meant and how to be happy and things like that. We started going to the gym together and it became apparent that we had a deeper connection than just friendship, so I (somewhat tortured by the decision of leaving a sure future with someone I definitely could have had a future with to gamble on something I thought I felt strongly about) broke up with my girlfriend and started dating Kate.

Things between Kate and I progressed very quickly, and I can honestly say I've never reached a level of comfort to that extent ever before, let alone at that speed. Things were pretty amazing, and we were planning for the future after she graduated from college. Things cooled down a little bit passion-wise, but I think that's to be expected in most relationships. 

On a few occasions she would question our relationship and we came close to breaking up a few times. I never really understood these episodes, and the only reason she could give was that something didn't feel right. In November (on Thanksgiving actually), she broke up with me and said it was for good over text, but that we could remain friends, which we did, even maintaining the sexual component. Right after Christmas she begged me to come over one day and I begrudgingly obliged, despite wanting to watch football and spend the day by myself. That night I found out she had feelings for her boss, and this culminated in a huge fight. I felt really used, but I couldn't bring myself to not talk to her anymore. She continued to sort of lead both of us on (her boss had a girlfriend, and she said she didn't want to do anything with him until that wasn't the case, she was also confused because I was still in the picture sort of). 

I got sort of tired of the situation and told her I wasn't going to do it anymore, but this turned into a weird talk about how much fun we'd had and we ended up sneaking into my parents' house to have sex at like 2 in the morning. For a while this kept up as well. We got a couples massage, I would drive to her school (about an hour away) sometimes to hang out.

Then suddenly it dried up and she pushed me away and I didn't know why. Turns out her boss had broken up with his girlfriend and she's sort of dating (I guess, read fucking) him. We got in a huge fight about how she has to do what's right for her and doesn't owe me anything and didn't lead me on and now we aren't talking.

Since the November breakup I've felt really lonely. Even with the friendship maintained I felt myself slipping into a depressive state. I started seeing a therapist and got on anti-depressants (which I don't think are doing anything). A lot of my friends have moved away (as is expected when you're 24) and as a naturally shy, and somewhat social-anxiety inhibited person I've found it hard find things to do or ways to connect with new people. The bar scene isn't really for me. I joined a softball league, but I haven't really made any lasting friendships there, and don't really foresee that happening. I really only have one friend left in the area, and a small handful of friends from high school/college that I still text occasionally. I work at a very small publishing company, where my only coworkers are a guy who works off site and my boss, who only comes in once every few days, so I'm alone in my office all day. I'm also moving out of my parents' house at the end of the month and living on my own.

I've had people break up with me before, but it's never affected me like this. The thought of her being with him is killing me. It's gotten to the point where I don't really enjoy the things I usually do (sports, video games, reading, writing, movies, making music) because I can't focus on them and I know I'm going to slip back into a natural depressive state after, and obsess about the thought of them together. I legitimately feel like it's taking years off my life. Therapy makes me feel better for a brief time, but once I'm on my own it hurts again.

Although I don't think much about online connections and relationships, I quickly found myself in one.


In the beginning of July I built this undeniably strong connection with a girl [Jamie] over the internet. I went into this knowing she had a boyfriend but I didn't think too much about it because I was not expecting to feel more than just friends. Jamie came into this knowing that she wasn't happy but she could tolerate what her boyfriend was putting her through.


We texted all day and all night from the beginning of when we met and conversing about many things petty things but also things that we cherished and the conversation always had a start to finish and never did I once feel like I was bored of talking to her.


This is where things started getting tricky. The more I talked to her the more I heard about her boyfriend Trey. Trey was her boyfriend that came to her at his convenience; she always told me how inattentive he was and he got jealous easily. She hinted at the idea of leaving the relationship explaining how unhappy she was with him because she didn't get the attention she deserved. Every time she brought it up, he would try to tell her it was all in her head and their relationship was fine.


She wanted to leave the relationship with him but was not ready because he was her first for many things. She told me that she was never in love with him but loved him.


For the past month I was her supplement of happiness because I was a mini getaway and I showed her I cared, that she did deserved attention. I was capable to provide emotional support and was always willing to talk to her about/through things. It was apparent that we got closer and closer because what she lacked in mental and emotional happiness I was able to bring her. Our feelings grew exponentially for each other. Before I knew it, I had feelings that I never intended for and she did too.


Last night she broke it off with Trey. She told me she would still see him around at school and I was okay with that. She still wanted to do things like how they did within the past 3 years and she wanted to slowly leave the relationship. She essentially told me she wanted to use him as her FWB until she was ready to leave. That was the part that hurt me. So why did they even break up? I don't know either. 


I care about her but I know it would kill me to just drop her from my life but I also know it would hurt me to see her doing stuff with her ex.


I guess what I'm just trying to ask for is some advice. Should I wait for her to slowly die out of her old habits with her Ex BF [Trey]? Or should I just leave the relationship we have and never look back.

87,1v38fu,"About an hour ago, my friend, (D), left my apartment. I've been close friends with D for two years. He was a mutual friend of my ex (at the time) and I. We've been hanging out as usual, (as friends) since my ex and I broke up, - over the duration of two months - but it has been strictly friendly up until about two weeks ago.

Two weeks ago, before I went to my hometown for the holidays, D kissed me goodbye. We kept in touch here and there during the holidays. Now that I'm back in town, he came over to mine to watch some episodes of a series and drink beer - the usual.. It's what we've always done.

After we finished up a few episodes, I was getting up to get a glass of water and he stopped me and kissed me. Things got a bit heated and as he went to unbutton my jeans, I stopped him and told him I couldn't because it was my time of the month. I know that this was a stupid lie, but I panicked. 

D said everything was fine and not to worry about it and then said So I've been thinking, are we a thing now?. Again, I panicked and said yes.

Things kind of wrapped up there and I walked him out. We said our goodbyes and he told me that he'd call me so that we can pick up where we left off next weekend.

I'm at a loss here. This guy is great.. Too bad I feel awfully about the fact that I don't know what I want. I feel bad saying this, but he also wasn't the best kisser and everything just felt awkward and uncomfortable for me. How on earth do I approach the fact that I do not want to be his girlfriend? It really caught me off guard. I truly appreciate him as a friend and don't want to lose him.

I can't even decide if I want to give this a shot or not, but I don't think it's a good idea because this has clearly moved along quickly given our previous record as close friends.

We live together. He doesn't brush his teeth. Maybe once every three or more days. In the past I've tried suggesting him coming and brushing with me before bed or before we leave and he instantly gets defensive and rude- saying things like hold on I'm eating first. Or ONE SEC I will. In a really snappy tone. Then he never actually brushes. 

I'm getting really sick and embarrassed of it. Obviously when he doesn't brush in three days, yellow gunk is very visible around his teeth and gum line, and his breath stinks. Two days ago his five year old niece called him out that his breath stinks and he didn't do anything. 

Last night I decided I had enough with him not brushing and brought it up before bed. I asked when the last time he brushed was and he lied and said the day before. I told him since he hasn't brushed his teeth all day and it was midnight- shouldn't he brush at least once, since you're suppose to twice a day? He got really defensive and said well maybe if you showered more I would brush more (btw- I shower every day or other day because if I do every day it dries out my hair too much and I never do anything strenuous enough to need a daily shower) I got a little aggravated and told him I shouldn't even need to ask him to brush, and he told me then stop nagging him and acting like his mother. I said I wouldn't need to nag and act like his mother if he just took care of himself. He just got all huffy and rolled his eyes and I went to bed upset. He has yet to brush his teeth and its twelve hours later which is why I'm posting. 

I love him a lot, but I don't know how much longer I can stay with him when his teeth are yellow- and I whiten mine weekly and brush twice a day. 

I love kissing and being sexual- but I refuse to kiss him when he hasn't brushed in days. Even when I refuse to kiss and tell him he needs to brush before I kiss him- he won't. It's damaging our intimacy and sex life- I won't make out with him or be interested in kissing since he doesn't brush- therefore not interested in sex. 

It's concerning to me that his girlfriend is trying to help him and obviously needs him to work on something and he won't listen or make an effort. If the roles were switched I would do whatever he asked if I could see it's important to him. 


TL;DR
boyfriend refuses to brush teeth- even when I ask him to and suggest he does it more often. He gets defensive and tries to turn it around and make it my fault- like if I do X more, he would bush more. I love him but can't take this much longer.  

Edit:  thanks for everyone's replies! You are all bringing up some issues I've kinda suppressed and should start dealing with now.

I think it's perfectly normal to not need a shower every so often when literally all you do is relax at home. Obviously every weekday or every day I go out or see people or go in public- I shower and get ready. If you tell me you've skipped showering on a weekend day every so often because there's no need to if you don't go out or see people, you're lying.

But a year after we started going out, I was able to move to China. We were in a normal relationship for a year before I moved back to the US and she stayed in China for school. Now she's moving to America to continue her education.

Now I do love her, but I don't think I'm romantically in love with her anymore. Its difficult to say when theres been such a long period where we haven't seen eachother.

The reason its complicated though is this. Now, if she was attending school in my hometown, I'd definitely want to continue the relationship. But unfortunately she chose a school which is 5 or more hours away. This bothers me the most because she was also accepted into a good school for her major a mere 2 minutes away from me. But her culture values the prestige of the big city so thats what she chose, even if it means that I'll only be able to see her a couple times a month and with a heavy investment of time and money.

960,3fhs1w,"I'm going to give a lot of backstory here so please bear with me.

So I'll start with the fact that I've liked this girl since 9th grade and only this year did I Manage to actually get up the courage to ask her out. From the start the relationship was pretty shaky. Between my lack of self-confidence at the time and miscommunication we’ve had a fair amount of issues through our 6 months (from jan to jun).

The situation right now is, like I said in the title, we’re on break. How this came about is she was leaving for the summer to go to a college program. The day before she leaves to go on this program me, her, and two other friends were all hanging out. The plan was that later that night, me and her family were having a birthday dinner for her since she was going to be out of town on her actual birthday. So we were hanging out and then she tells me that another friend (a girl) is going to drive her home. At the time it made zero sense, but I told myself it was nothing and that she just wanted to spend more time with that friend. So I head home too to get ready for this dinner. I get a text from her saying what time I should be there for the dinner, and then 15 minutes later she calls me and breaks up with me over the phone. Her reasoning for breaking up with me was that “she just couldn’t be in a relationship right now.” I was very quiet for the phone call. Just saying Okay’s and trying my best to contain the confusion, anger and sadness.

The next morning I wake up to a text she had sent early in the morning saying how breaking up with me had been a mistake. How “me not saying anything (on the phone call)” had hurt her and how she “wished I had fought for us because now she sees how big of a mistake she had made.” How she was afraid of going away. How she would “rather have nothing to come back to so that she’s not worrying about people here while she’s away.”

Of course I’m still crazy about this girl so I say maybe the best thing for us to do is to go on a break for the summer and see where we are at the end. 

For the past weeks I’ve been getting advice from those around me on what to do. And they all think that she is awful to me and that I should get out. What’s happened in the relationship is as follows:

So the big issue was that I read queues from her incorrectly a few times. 

The first time was the first time I took off her shirt and bra. We had been dating for about a month and were in a heavy make-out session and I just felt it was the thing to do (this is my first real relationship also). She didn’t stop me or give any indication that she wasn’t comfortable with it. It wasn’t until afterwards, the next day through text, that she got mad at me for doing so. I apologized profusely and really still do feel bad about that. Because the last thing I ever wanted to do was make her uncomfortable.

Next was another failed queue. Going to second base. Again intense make-out session. At this point she’s comfortable with me taking her shirt off and such so I start trying to go further. I slip my hand down her pants. Again no, “No”, no physical sign of disagreement and she even slips her hand down mine. Then suddenly she gets up and says she has to go to the bathroom. When she comes back she says she thinks I should go. The next day I try to contact her but she doesn’t respond for quite a while into the day, at which point she again gets extremely mad at me for it. I was so confused because it seemed like she was fine with it and now this. 

So for the next 4 months we don’t ever go back to second base. She felt physically reserved from me for that time. Never coming up to me to kiss me (just a regular kiss), as in if I didn’t try to kiss her she would never kiss me. And we didn’t make out very often. I get that that experience was emotionally scarring for her and that she might have difficulty because of that, but after a while it just felt like a weird grudge because in the moment she had gone along with it. (This was not her first time going there with someone)

Where I get more confused is five days before she breaks up with me we’re making out and, without ever having gone to second base, she decides she wants to have sex, right then. It was weird because we hadn’t ever gone past shirts coming off and suddenly, this. For me it was wonderful, because it told me that she was finally moving past what had happened in the past. That she was ready to move forward. And I was ecstatic because I hated the fact that she was uncomfortable with me because of that.

We were both virgins at the time so it is so strange to me how 5 days after she does that with me, she breaks up with me. Honestly it hurts a lot because I feel like I have been cheated of that moment. Because it’s hard to feel like that moment mattered when she so quickly dumped me afterward.

And the night she breaks up with me, she’s texting me all these super dirty seductive things. Less than 24 hours beforehand she’s texting me this. I don’t understand.

There are other things:

For one she had this friendship with her ex. They would send each other texts of songs they thought each other would like. And she would text him while she was with me. I expressed that annoyed me and she stopped. However the bigger issue was that for the last month before she broke up with me, not a single date went by where she didn’t mention his name. She’s quite a storyteller, which is something I love about her, but she kept bringing him up over and over (she even did in a fight one time). Even after I expressed that the texts annoyed me she continued to bring him up and it drove me insane. She told me the texts didn’t mean anything and honestly with how much she talked about him I had a hard time believing her.

Finally, her issue with me. She said that she was getting bored in the relationship, that I was being “spontaneous” enough. And it was true to a degree. I didn’t come up with super spectacular date ideas for us very often, but… My experiences being spontaneous with her were hardly encouraging to make me do it more often. On Valentine’s Day I showed up early at her house to make her breakfast in bed, came with a present that was a book of the works of one of her favorite artist’s, and tickets to a play later in the night. What that got me was her not eating the breakfast I made her, and her texting her ex on the drive to the play (on our fucking valentine’s day (one day after technically))… When I had tried to be spontaneous sexually I made huge errors and moved way too fast. Asking her to prom I filled her room with balloons, made her a huge “Prom?” sign in calligraphy that took me hours. And that got me a smile (if I remember I didn’t even get a hug for that). And finally on a drive to some botanical gardens (a “spontaneous idea” I crafted) I hid in my car chocolates, flowers, and a drink she really liked and revealed them to her over time. No thank you, and she left the flowers in the car afterwards. It’s true I could have done more. But her responses to nice things I did for her were really underwhelming and honestly made it very hard to do consistently.

There’s more I could write, like how she’s a self-proclaimed narcissist, how it always felt like hot or cold with her, but what matters is through this there’s still a part of me that wants to be back with her. And I don’t know what to do. I’m resorting to you guys.

Should I try like my heart (sorry cheesy) tells me to? Or should I listen to everyone around me and stay away?

**TL;DR**
Im on a break with my girlfriend and there’s a bunch of shit I can’t ignore that tells me I shouldn’t stay with her, and yet for some reason I still want to. Help me please..

I broke up with my ex girlfriend about 6 months ago and started online dating to find someone new - I'm from Europe by the way in case that might change anything.

As it goes in online dating, you find a couple of interesting girls and send them a message. Some of them answer, some don't. You meet up for a drink and if you have fun together things move on to the next level. 

In that particular week, I met 4 girls. 2 were boring or just not my type, 2 were great. Thus, you meet again, and again, and end up in bed and ... now there are 2 great, educated and attractive girls who are totally girlfriend material but don't have a clue that there is the other one and that I would do such a thing.

Just to give you a perspective: I met each girl a couple of times but things got already close and intense. I think I totally fucked up since I don't want to hurt anyone which might be inevitable even at that early stage. Yet, realistically, it is at an early stage and I should clarify the situation, i.e. end seeing one of them as things will become closer and more difficult. 

Now, I have absolutely no idea which one I should drop - and how to do it. Both are great and have their advantages. I would have to go for meaningless secondary criteria and might end up with the one I might not want to be with.

Seriously, I don't know what to do and things will get worse.

I'm also wondering if this is perceived differently by different genders. E.g. As a woman (in a relationship) I'd discourage someone flirting with me because they could potentially be scary or threatening.

My mother is moving into a 2 bedroom house with 5 kids a month after I turn 18.. she has made it clear I am not welcome to join them. So I have no choice but to work my ass off or live in a box. I'm trying not to allow myself to become too stressed about this, because it will eat away at me. I have accepted the situation and am doing what I can. 

My boyfriend is finishing up high school, has not applied to any colleges, does not have a job, and plays video games locked in his room most of the day. I have tried to talk to him, help give him a little extra push in the right direction. I am not the type of person to force things upon someone, so I give him my opinion and let him make his own decisions. He is a very intelligent young man with great potential that I don't think he is living up to. He says that he wants to get a job, go to school, ect.. but when it comes down to it, he hasn't put any effort into any of it. His parents try to encourage him to do things, get a job, anything other than play video games and smoke. It seems the more encouraging people do, the less he wants to do it.  His parents are also very much against him freeloading off of them after he graduates. When I try to talk to him about future plans, or us moving in together, or him going to school, anything that has to do with the future. He has nothing to say... or he'll tell me he sent in applications and a week later say he hasn't gotten around to sending in those applications. 


I love him dearly. I can see myself spending my life with him and he says the same. His lack of ambition worries me though. It's not that these conversations come up a lot, or that I'm trying to push him in a direction he doesn't want to go in. If he wants to live off his parents and play video games forever, than that's totally fine... I just won't stick around. 

I'm nervous because I have some big decisions to make.. I want him to be a part of those decisions but I also don't want to push him into growing up as fast as I had to.

About 2 months into the friendship it sort of turned into a relationship. This didn’t last too long. See Alice has this ex and she has a kid with him. The thing is while I and Alice were getting into a relationship he was nowhere to be found. Once he found out she might be moving on from him he started to move back into her life. 

Once I found out about this I got upset because she was letting him back even though I was in the picture. So we had a little fight about it and things got weird between us. Once this happened she started hanging out with the ex and not me. This lasted about a week until she came back to me. We started to hang out once again and things were good for a little while. But now the ex wants to be with his kid (which wasn’t the case for the last 4 years) which she lets him do because it’s also his kid. That’s fine with me but the thing is I think he’s using the kid only because he doesn’t want to lose her (he’s very controlling). She has said to me many times before that she just doesn’t want to be with him for the rest of her life. But the thing is she has been with him for 6 years and I see her trying to move on but every time she does, it ends up with her trying to figure things out with him. 

Anyways I and Alice we cool for a while until I found out she let him live with her because she felt bad for him and its easier. This has happened before, but she came back to me about a week later. Again I got upset because I thought it was stupid and just because you feel bad for him doesn't mean you owe him anything and don't do things just because its easy. This was about a week ago and we really haven’t talked ever since. I've tried multiple times to sit down and talk but she keeps avoiding it. I know she and the ex are talking and she always gets weird when she’s around him and that’s why she may be not talking.

1189,3f4zq4,"Hey Reddit! To start off so you know a brief summary of the type of person I am I've taken a couple Myers Briggs personality tests and came up with the result ENTJ and once or twice as ESTJ. I am quite an attractive young man, very intelligent, fit and emotionally aware. Throughout high school I kept to myself and wasn't too worried about social structure as long as I felt comfortable and was in a friend group where I was accepted no matter what. I also was probably addicted to video games and the internet (although not the social media side.) I liked to party, drink and smoke weed from time to time but my friend group of course didn't ever really have parties as you could probably guess. However, over my high school career I did attend a few of some of the more popular kids parties because I played a lot of sports. Sorry for this lengthy intro I'm just trying to give y'all a better picture of who I am, not that you need it I guess.

**Tl;DR:** Fairly good looking guy, smart, fit, but addicted video games and hung out with the gamers in high school. Liked to party, but did rarely.


I have been with my girlfriend for just over 6 months now and this is the first serious girlfriend I've ever had. She spends her free time playing soccer and just hanging out with friends, which for some reason I get really jealous of or suspicious that they're going to sneak out and smoke weed and/or see other boys. She has only had one other semi-boyfriend who I have not met but I know he cheated and has been asking to get her back and I guard her fiercely. I was her first nearly everything, other than me her previous boyfriend she had only made out with, (to my knowledge) we have gone as far as anal. She also happened to be my first everything including kiss (that wasn't just a smooch.) 

The real problem lies in the fact that I do not trust her and I have no reason I can think of for that. I always find myself asking her where she is and who she is hanging out with, always making sure that if she's with a friend there are no boys around or they aren't going out. I hate when she goes out and drinks not because I don't like alcohol it's just that I don't want her seeing other guys there and for some reason even though she's shown no signs of it, I always get a weird feeling like she's cheating or something if she isn't talking to me via text the whole time, which when I think about after the fact is probably crazy. I do everything in my power to not allow her to go out to parties because I am worried of her developing feelings for other men at the very least. Another incident is when she wanted to go to her first rave and I somehow managed to talk her out of it and tried to shame her for wanting to go because they seem slutty to me and I know the guys my age go just to hook up with chicks and I fell like that's what the girls do too. I remember her saying I just want to go to see live music and dance with my friends. I felt infuriated by that excuse and like it was bullshit. To me what that translated to was I wanna go grind on guys and make out with them. I worry and stress myself out and even get angry at her almost every time she goes out. 

I myself am still quite reserved and spend a lot of time alone playing video games and occasionally seeing friends but almost never partying. To sum all these incidents up; I freak out and feel like she's cheating whenever she's with guys I don't know (and only the ones I don't know) or if she's with her girlfriends going out and seeing people etc. Sorry for the wall of text everyone! Can anyone here help me clear up some of my misconceptions and lack of trust in my girlfriend? Please? I'm worried about our relationship going into the future.

916,2kknss,"Sorry for text wall; this is complicated. To sum up, I think my SO is being really overly-dramatic about his future career prospects... but now he's got me worried too.

I've been in love with this guy since freshman year of college. I graduated, he needed to take one more semester (stupid college bureaucracy). I'm in grad school (not a program where I get a stipend, sadly) and he's finishing up that last semester of undergrad on the other side of the country. We're still together. It's not very satisfying to carry on a relationship via Skype, but it's working.

In December, my SO will graduate. If he manages to have a job lined up by then, then we can stay in touch, because he'll almost certainly be living somewhere where he has internet. Maybe he'll even be able to move to the same town as me, which would be really nice, but I'm not counting on it. We'll work apart for as many months as it takes for us both to become financially stable, at which point we'll do what we can to be together... possibly for good. I don't know. We've been deeply committed for almost five years; it would be unspeakably good to know that I never have to say goodbye to him again.

But here's the thing: if he doesn't get a job, he says, I will never see him again... and although I think he's being melodramatic and ridiculous, I'm starting to think he might be right. His family is not well-off, if he can't get a decent-paying job of his own right out of the gate, he'll need to move back in with them. They live in a remote, mountainous area; there's no internet, no cell phone service, no public transportation, and only one car for the whole family (which he isn't allowed to drive). He's several miles' walk from the nearest tiny town. The last time he was home, his parents got very upset that the phone bill was so high, because he called me for two hours once a week, after everybody else had gone to bed on Saturday night. My only reliable means of communication with him will be the good old USPS.

My SO wants to work in a highly technical field––and he knows that without internet access, finding this job will be utterly impossible. He believes that if he goes home, it'll be a one-way street into a bleak life of service jobs. Without reliable communication, he says, I'll drift away. I have been unable to convince him otherwise.

I have been trying to talk him out of this feeling for months, especially because the stress of what will happen if he doesn't get a job is impeding his ability to actually get that job, but it's pretty hard to do over the phone. I keep telling him that it's not the end of the world if he has to work in retail for a while, but he sees that as a complete failure––he spent thousands of his parents' money to go to college, and for what?

I wish I could just take him in with me until he can get on his feet, but I can't, for a variety of reasons (lease that only allows one person to live in my apartment, family has problems with him, in tight financial straights myself at the moment).

Reddit, how do I talk him out of this stupid melodrama? Or do I not, and just pray that the job thing works out? It's really unlike him to be this irrationally morose about hypothetical situations. I've even wondered if he's trying to use this as an excuse to break up with me... but A) he's assured me that if he wanted to break up, he'd say it outright, and B) he seems to have so much dread over me leaving that it's actually hurting him.

465,1w2g8z,"Some background: 

I've known my boyfriend since the beginning of college, going on four years. We were good friends until we started dating a year ago this valentine's day. At first he was enthusiastic,  energetic, positive and encouraged me to be positive about my life, because I was in a bad place when we started out.  Over the summer I basically moved in, and he seemed happy. 

Slowly I watched him become sad, withdrawn, negative and bored. When I asked him what was wrong he told me he was bored and unhappy with his life. This was about a month and a half ago. It didn't seem like something that was going to end our relationship.

Fast forward to two days ago. All week I had asked him what was wrong but kept saying nothing. I finally forced him to tell me and once we started talking he suddenly spit out I think we should take a break and there was no going back. He said he knows how much I love him but isn't sure if he loves me in the same way, or if its possible at all. He won't tell me why he's depressed, he just pushed me out of his life. He just kept saying he needed time.

I know that pushing him right now will push him away for good. He kept saying he knew that I was perfect for him. A 9 out of 10 relationship and girlfriend. But that he needed time and space to figure things out. I don't know if there's hope anymore.  What hope I did have is slowly slipping away. I just don't know what to do anymore. How much time is enough. How much time will turn into too much that pushes him away. Any advice would be appreciated. I feel so incredibly lost and completely heartbroken. 


Edit: in the time that we've been dating we have never had a serious fight. We both cook for a living, have the same friends, go to the same school for the same degree. I guess that's why this is so difficult. Even though it had only been a year I feel like my other half is missing. He was me in male form.

291,2b106g,"We met through some mutual friends at the start of June. Her (let's call her Jane) and I were in the same group skype call that regularly played games together from two nearby highschools, mine and hers. I was never well acquainted with the majority of the people in that chat, and Jane was primarily there because she was dating one of the guys there at the time. 

When everyone else started up a league of legends game, I noticed she had been left out to dry and hit her up with a message asking if she wanted to play a few games. She wanted to and we started chatting on voice and video late into the night (like 4 am). This became the regular procedure for the next week and a half. We seemingly had everything in common, from views on the world to past experiences to our favorite kind of ice cream. We became really good friends quickly and probably within a couple of weeks best friends. I feel bad about it because it was over such a short amount of time but we had such a natural connection between us, we could talk all day and all night every day and never get bored or annoyed with each other and always talking about something. And we're both rather shy, so it was miraculous for me.

Jane ended up breaking up with her boyfriend about the fifth day after we started talking. That night she started talking to me about a potential relationship she wanted with me but the very next morning decided strongly against it due to it only being a week in. Jane regularly switches her mind about important things from one day to the next, which often left me confused and concerned. I made the mistake of saying I loved her then despite it being way too early and I was just trying to be sweet. So I never said that again and she never told me she loved me either.

A week after we started talking she took a vacation and we couldn't talk much but she still wanted to as often as possible. We started playing other games like minecraft and after she got back she just started becoming my whole life and it was amazing for me. I had never had this close of a connection with anyone and everything just felt right. I think we know almost everything about each other. She always managed to make me feel better and I really hoped it was the same vice versa. She always gave mixed feelings, sometimes I feel like she loved me wholeheartedly but other times I feel like I was just a pain to deal with and that she didn't like me at all.

Anyway, two weeks after we start talking. Enter this guy, we'll call him Chris. Jane tells me that she went on a date with him but she said she didn't get anything out of it and that it was awkward. She said she just did it because she wanted to see if there was any personality to him to back up his attractive looks. She always said he was very attractive. While it did hurt me a bit, I acted like I didn't mind. A few days later, she tells me she wants to date me.

So we do. We spend a few hours at a mall together and got sushi for dinner which was fun and I think we both had a great time. She wasn't sure she wanted a relationship or was ready for one. I was, and I told her I really liked her but I made sure to not pressure her into anything. She told me she really liked me too but it was complicated because she had a lot to deal with in her life. Last year she got horrible grades despite typically being a A-B student, her mom got remarried this summer and soon she will be a big sister though she'll be 17 before it happens and probably won't get the full experience of it due to the age difference. So I understood completely and didn't mind giving her time to sort her feelings and priorities. 

Fast forward to last Monday. Jane comes over to my house to hang out, and we watch a movie, cuddle a bit and have a great time. She meets my family who all loves her because she is so nice and sweet. That night she told me she wanted to date me exclusively, and then later that night after a bit of talking she said she wanted to have an official relationship with me. Which I was more than fine with.

Wednesday comes and she comes over to hang out at my house again. Watch another movie and have a great time snuggling, we kissed once. She logged onto her facebook and showed me some cute childhood pictures of her and I did the same on my other computer's photo folders. I thought everything was perfect. 

That night, after spending two hours out running errands I message her and don't get a reply within two hours when she normally is always on. Confused, I check skype and she's changed her profile picture. Which means she's on and must not want to talk to me. However, since I trust her and care about her so much I give her the benefit of the doubt and go to check facebook to see if she's online there. 

Turns out she left her facebook up. No biggie, I'll just log out and get on mine so I can see- and then, I get a message from Chris. About how much fun that would be. So before I know it I'm reading the chat. They have barely even talked over several weeks but apparently now Jane is complaining about me to him, saying how she wants to cuddle with him and go to homecoming with him, and how I'm sweet but controlling (her reasoning for this is, I ask her to go to bed at a certain time, like 2 or 3 am, because she is always really tired in the morning and a complete mess when she's tired). So if that's controlling I'm sorry. I have done everything I can to be the person that you can count on and trust, Jane. And I'm not sure she ever trusted me now. And she also mentions that she'll tell me all this after I get back from my vacation so it looks like she put thought into it so it doesn't hurt me as much. The vacation is now cancelled anyways because my sisters sick. That's when I really started crying. And I never cry.

So I do probably a very stupid thing. Message her on skype again saying there's something I really want to talk to you about. She picks up call. First thing I blurt out is, Hey. You left your facebook logged in. it takes her a second but she understands and then backs up her point. Yeah.. I just don't feel it and don't think its going to work out. 

This is when she initiated a kiss with me no less than six hours beforehand. She seemed like she was having a great time. And the whole week before she was trying to decide whether she liked me or not, swapping off every other day between I love him or I don't. Confused and frustrated the hell out of me because I felt really strongly for this girl.

Anyway. We stay on call. She says she's sorry. I say it's like I've been stabbed through the heart ten times. Which is completely true. I could've said other things I was feeling too but didn't, like that this is the worst anyone has ever hurt me and that I just want to die. She says she's sorry again. And again. And before I know it she just breaks down and cries for twenty minutes that she fucked up so bad and ruined something that could have been amazing, that she did this to me of all people who has been so nice to her. How she doesn't ever deserve me or to be friends with me or to even talk to me and that she understands if I hate her. And then I go emotionless. She says we'll talk about this tomorrow and hangs up.

Then I get another facebook message from Chris (still logged into Jane's account). Hey bud ;) Jane responds and then before I know it I'm at the log in screen because Jane changed her password and kicked me off. Must really not trust me even after what she just did. Then I feel the effects. My heartbeat gets even more irregular and quick, I'm sweating, lightheaded, and dizzy and it's getting progressively worse. I'm losing it fast and thank god one of my best friends (call her Jessica) was available to text at 1 am or I think I might have gone into shock. Jessica tells me she loves me (as friends, we're really not each others type and she has a lot of relationship issues) and is really sorry for me and to get some sleep because I'll feel better in the morning. Which is enough to keep me sane. 

Morning comes and I'm up at 7. This is Thursday by the way, day before the night I'm writing this, and I spend the whole day waiting for Jane to get back on and talk to me about it. Finally after much ignoring on her part I get her to message me back on facebook at 9 PM. She says she fucked up and can't bear to speak to me because she feels so much guilt. That we can never date again because she's too afraid to hurt me like that again. That she doesn't even know if we can still be friends because she doesn't think I can look at her the same way. Then she says she needs some alone time and to leave her alone. 

So I do. And I don't know what to do now. The person I talked to during my waking hours is now away from me for at least a week, the person I loved is now gone, and I feel like it's all my fault even though it isn't. And then I get on reddit, make a throwaway account, hoping to get some advice on what to do next and how to handle the situation. Sorry for the long read.

245,2ple7s,"Living in couple for 5 months, everything happened in a heartbeat... i fell for him instantly, his loneliness attracted me from day one. He can be the best bf despite his flaws, which I have looked past because he “claimed” he wants to better himself (hardcore smoker and very unhealthy lifestyle). He can eat any and everything and wouldn’t stop eating unless he cant move, like he would eat a full meal, with side dishes (salad and leftovers), desert, chips, candy, and still continue to eat.. At times I felt as if I have been spending my paychecks on grocery, I cooked almost every day, even make breakfast in the morning for him. I am juggling two part time, one which I am still in training and have lots of classes and modules. My bf works 7 days. He hardy does anything around the house, we have had an issue before about him helping out.. he does dishes once or twice a week. And I never hear the end of it. 

Hes so lazy when it comes to sex. Like we would go for over a week without sex, he get arouse but don’t want to do anything. He doesn’t even wants to cuddle/hug me before falling asleep, instead he hugs a pillow and wants his own blanket. I am very sexual. I love having sex and I made it very clear from the beginning. (his exes cheated on him in the past for the same issue). He claims he cant sleep if we touch at night, which is bs cause nights that we touches he falls asleep instantly. Its no different from the other nights. I put up with a lot of crap but no sex or cuddling is a deal breaker in my book. He stresses me out with his job issues, his health cause he wont stop smoking, he complains about getting fat but wont stop eating. We don’t go out, only time we do is when we need to get grocery or sometimes we do movies. We would argue for the smallest things. He keep complaining about his life and wouldnt do anything to improve it. 

I am a happy person, always jolly but lately I have been so down with all of this stress. Every time I suggest we breakup things gets back on track. He has a very nasty temper, holds grudges for days. At times he would say he doesn’t love me, he don’t want me, or I should get out of his place. Then things are back on track.. he would say the nastiest things to me and then expects me to forget about it. For example: he brought a blanket from his mom, I cant sleep with it because the material has a lot of statics, we have a full bed, he is already sleeping with extra pillow on the bed and now suggested he wants that very blanket also. That was an argument cause the blanket scare the crap out of me with the constant static shocks. Instead of him being understanding towards me like have some consideration he gets upset, then later claims that he don’t care, he just wanted the blanket because it was there. He wanted to make things better and so did I, after work things were good, then comes bed time…….. he left me at 10;30pm to go fix his dads computer, came back at 11:45 and still wont hug me to bed.. then this morning we argued about it and about me wanting sex. He said I don’t get it.. he don’t want to have sex with me. He says a lot of things when hes angry. I am so confuse about his mix signals.. hes 28 and I am 33.

558,1ivyjl,"Over the last several months, I've found myself being tossed some emotional turbulence.  I'd like some helpful advice, fellow redditors.


I'm trying to figure out the right path here to an issue that has been making me incredibly unhappy, and I think I'm struggling because it hits at the deep core of what makes me - and maybe people, tick.


A couple of years ago I was seeing a number of women, albeit casually. After several months, I decided to take a shot on one (30F). My decision wasn't based on heavily physical attraction, but more so, the interaction we shared and that I saw our lives growing along similar tracks.  She's an incredible young woman who has proven herself to be a great partner in many regards.  So, I broke things off with the others and committed. Chemistry wasn't our high point though. Sex was OK, but I often felt something missing.


Fast-forward two years now.  We're still together and are mapping out some major life changes.  Thing is, I'm afraid that our sex life is not all that I'd want it to be, and that literally, that I may have feelings for someone else.


About 6 months after breaking off all other dating relationships, one of the women I was previously dating got back in touch.  Over the last year or so, we've developed a friendship, knowing we were both involved in other people.  We've built up a ton of respect and caring for each other, and tend to just naturally get each other easily.


Thing is, maintaining our friendship hasn't been easy - due to attraction.  Thing is, it just doesn't go away. While we've kept ourselves above board, we recently talked about this and mutually decided to cut off contact after she came out and told me flat out that she wants to be together. As in, I choose you, period.


The problem is is that I haven’t found my current relationship satisfying, and I think it comes down to just not having an amazing sexual connection.  We're amazing partners and companions, but not great lovers. And this pull towards my friend is not simply because someone is interested - we just have that connection.


It’s as if we are amazing life partners, but not amazing lovers. And mind you, this issue would be present regardless of the fact that someone else is interested – that in and of itself is no big thing to me - it has been that this pull - and confusion - has often been there.


I’ve often found myself wanting to be able to explore things, but what to do? How can someone pull the plug on what is otherwise a great relationship?


how can I go about breaking up what otherwise would be a truly amazing relationship over something we have no control over - i.e. chemistry?


I'd appreciate some solid advice given that I'm trying to dig down and sort this all out internally in the right way - looking at everything with a critical eye (including myself). I want to do the right thing here, and be fair to everyone, but it's beating me up.

426,352s2f,"Basically a few months back I met this girl and we really hit it off. For the first month of so we were constantly talking to each other and on a few occasions we got physically really close. I invited her over for a movie and she stayed overnight and slept in the same bed with me. Things were going good, we had a few sort of playful kisses but mostly cuddling and she seemed like she was really into me at the time. 

However soon after that we no longer saw each other outside of school, because she was having some personal issues and while I was constantly there supporting her, she always had a reason why we wouldn't hangout. This could genuinely be because she was sad or depressed about something, or she just didn't want to be with me. 

At some point I confronted her about it and she told me that she is not ready for a relationship, as a couple months back she had a rough breakup. She had told me about this previously so I kinda want to believe her, but I'm not sure if this is just a load of cheap
bullshit for me to stop bothering her, but she still said that she would like for us to be friends. Even though I still have strong feelings towards her, I said that it's fine and that we can stay friends.

Lately however I feel like she has been sort of getting a bit closer to me and sometimes it feels like she is flirting with me. I might just be imagining this, but I feel like there might be a tiny little chance, she is still into me. At some point I stumbled across one of her social media things and I noticed that she had said that she does have I guess a crush on someone. I'm not sure if this someone is me or if I'm just really desperate.

I would like to ask her, but I feel like after her telling me that she does not want a relationship with me, it's none of my business.

I occasionally smoke weed and she has expressed that she would be interested in trying it at some point.

795,2s2bl8,"So, my SO has always been...well...not the best texter. Suffice it to say, in the very beginning of our relationship, it was confusing to the point of me wondering whether she was all that into me. Most of the time, she's just fine, but sometimes she can go long stretches without checking in. Might not sound like much, but it's always signified a bothersome level of aloofness for me. It's something both of her parents (she's an only child) have gotten on her about (i.e. she does the same thing to them and others), and which I have pointed out has been confusing and a little hurtful for me a couple times in the past. 

So, long story short, I recently moved to another city to make a life with her and, last month, she decided, much to my somewhat irrational annoyance, to visit the east coast for the weekend for an excursion with her best friend from college (nice girl; I've met her). Their plan was to see a concert with their old college pals.

As I predicted, I didn't hear jack squat from her last night. I texted her a have a great time! message earlier in the evening, and now, the following morning, there is still no correspondence from her. 

Keep in mind this is not totally unusual. More than likely, she got inebriated, caught up in the moment, but I'm pretty upset. It seems only right to me to at least text a had fun, going to bed now message of some kind simply to let one's partner know that all went well and that everyone is safe and sound.

I know it it might seem extremely petty of me to be upset over such a seemingly small infraction, but I think it pisses me off because I've been very clear in the past that radio silence bothers me. And I don't think I'm crazy for wondering about a few things...i.e. is she ok? Did she take dangerous levels of alcohol (or whatever else) and pass out in a bad situation? And, I'll admit I'm worried if she banged another guy. Who wouldn't be in my situation?

I guess my question is...should I be upset? Or am I overreacting? Should I have a talk with her about this? 

I'm trying so, so hard not to be possessive or jealous in any way, to the point of maybe excusing some things and looking the other way when I shouldn't.

We both have conflicting work schedules; she has an internship that ends mid-day while my job makes me work nights.


The lack of seeing each other kind of contributed to the rising tension. It also included with a severe lack of sex since we're both tired at the end of the night. This along with a myriad of other problems made me quite depressed about the whole situation. 


We had a serious talk, and I asked her if she really can do commute. She said she cannot do the commute, she was being honest with me. She had to move out in order to be closer to her University. I understood, the drive and the amount of work she would do would be stressful, and I'm glad that she is doing this. 

I went to a school therapist and they suggested we take a break; a time for us to decompress, and expand on ourselves as individuals rather than being a couple. I talked to my GF about what the therapist said, and this idea scares both of us, but the therapist made good points. I am for the break (because of what the therapist said), but she is not (though she said she will do it for the benefit of us getting better and me being happier). We love each other very much, but I feel like time apart will do us good. 

I have seen on this sub-Reddit and people have said Break = Break-Up, you only want to fuck/sleep with other people. This isn't even on my mind and farther away from hers. I told my girlfriend my intention of the break is to decompress and focus on ourselves (as the therapist said). I did tell my girlfriend that if we do meet someone, we can date them seeing that we're on a break. I love her and who she is and everything she does, but I feel like time apart can do *some* good. By mid-August, she will be leaving back to her university about an hour away from me for her last year.


   
**tl;dr**: Talked moving in with GF for ~2 years, sounded fun. Moved it, tension rose, talked about taking a break idea from therapist. We love each other, but understand why we must break, but things on Reddit scare me about breaking.

I am finding it very hard to cope with this loss and I have no idea what to do. I am a figity nervous wreck anytime I have time to myself. I haven't eaten anything in days, I've lost at least 10lbs of weight, and I don't get any more than 3-4 hours of sleep. 

I already bought a ring and was planning on proposing to her. She broke up with me because of the time it would take me to finish my degree in mechanical engineering (she too is going for the same degree). I'm at a very low point in my life, and the time it would take to finish this degree would be at least 3-4 years. She will be finished with hers by May of 2016. 

She says that she cannot wait for me, that it would be too long to start a life together. That my study habits aren't as determined as hers were when she was in the same situation a few years back. She is very determined now, but she feels I don't have the same determination as she did. She also said that my complaining annoys her. I would vent to her my frustrations with school/work. Something that I think anyone would express to their significant other, but I didn't know I was just giving her the rope to hang myself with. 

This breakup was completely out of the blue for me. I did not see it coming at all, and she said because of the reasons stated, that she rationalized things and they wouldn't work out. I always treated her the best, and always put her ahead of all other priorities. I had no idea there were any problems in our relationship until the breakup. I don't know what to do. I don't know how to cope. What makes it worse for me is that I have finals this week, and this just added extra stress to an already stressful time. 

She says that she needs time and space. Her last words to me were I dont want to say this is it. But i feel like i want so much space. And it hurts me to rationalize these things. I just don't know what to do or think. I've rationalized a lot, despite what you may think. And it isn't something i expected to happen

I really don't want to lose her, and have yet to talk to her face to face. The breakup was through facebook.

I come to you broken, I was with a girl for 3 years and in that time I worked a good goverment job and contracting job in order to make ends meet. I would give her an allowance of $600 a month out of my $1400 to survive, and buy her anything she would need such as food and clothes. She's a cosplayer so when ever she wanted I would buy her outfits and send her with cash to con's. Yes she only went to 5 cons and then to her model friends in Florida and Las Vegas but I still paid for those trips. 

I admit I wasn't a great boyfriend. I tried to support her until she got a job as a jailer, a goverment job. now she does nude modeling on the side with that job. I fear that, that will hinder her or comeback and affect her, but she doesn't want to hear it. I tried using reason and even posting about it as a threat to wake her up. But to no avail. I have no plan of ever releasing this information or what site she's on. 

I've known she sent guy's nudes and money, from 2011 and she just now admitted to it right before we broke up. I believe she was jealous because I was talking, nothing more, to a high school flame, that started the issues.  

We never had sex nor could she, which was backed up medically finally this year. That always lingered on my mind and drove me insane. 

My point is that i paid for everything and have nothing to show for it. I hate that I'm a jealous bitter man. but part of me say's I should get paid back some small amount.

today was the day that i was to meet my GF and talk about things and hopefully patch things up and move on... 

in talking to her i knew that i had made a big mistake, giving out to her for not asking me to go with her to visiting her friends.  her reply was that she didnt want to pressure me by asking if i would like to go... i dont know about you... but asking isnt pressuring... pressuring is asking non stop and making someone feel bad about it. 

but anyway, after that she gave out to me because i was supposed to know how she was feeling, she was borderline depressed the past 6 weeks because of a medical issue, which she told me 2 weeks after it showed up. i tried to talk to her about every issue that arose, her family arguing, her aunt being unwell, her medical issue, the exams, everything that i could i asked her about and half the time she would reply with i dont want to talk about it 

now i understand that she doesnt want to tlak about things, but is it fair to assume that i should know the extent of her bad feelings when the only way we can talk is through text (that she never talked about her feelings in)? when i see her i can tell by how she is sitting if she is scared or nervous, i can tell by how she eats her bread if she is worried about someone or if she is angry... but i havent been able to spend 1 full day with her in 6 weeks and im supposed to just **know** how bad she is feeling? 

to me that is unfair... what i did was wrong... but the reason that all this happened is because i gave out when she was trying to get over these bad feelings she never told me about, feelings i had no idea about... when i ever even made her feel remotely bad for doing something or saying something that i wasnt happy with , that i never told her, she would always reply, you cant expect me to know if you dont talk to me... well she did the same thing

the issues with her friend... even her mother had no idea until she went back home and her mother could see how bad she was... people wont just **know** you need to tell them... 

so here i am after being on a rollercoaster of emotions from being terrified and close to having a panic attack, to being sad, depressed and crying to now being pissed off because i lost the best lady ive ever met because she assumed i knew things she never told me and things i had no opportunity to find out by her behavior. 

this sucks... but all i can do now is be there for her because she needs someone to be there and ill be damned if i make this worse by making her feel like she has lost another person in her life. i hope one day she has a clear enough head to be able to look back on this and realise that i couldnt know... there was no way i could know... not without seeing her at least... 


**tl;dr** GF broke up with me saying i should be able to sense how bad she was feeling from text messages in which she would barely talk to me in, and would never talk about how she felt... she thinks that in a relationship the people involved are supposed to know exactly how someone feels all the time, whether together or apart, for days or weeks, whether they tell them or now...

74,31hhkn,"First of all, when I transferred to my SO's school, I had to live on campus (while he lives off campus) because it's the university rules. Their dorms cost 10k and I found an on campus apartment for 5k but I would live with 3 other girls (we don't split the cost everyone pays the same price which sucks). I ended up living secretly with my SO for a year, my mom didn't know that part because I know she would've flipped.


My parents know and have met my SO and they like him, his parents also like me. We've known one another since high school.
My SO and I attend the same university and both of us pay a lot of money for housing, my dad constantly urges me to find a cheap place that I can live in next year. My SO also wants to save some money by splitting the current apartment with me. He currently pays around 4.4k for it but separately each would pay around 2.2k a year! 
I already told my mom about the plan and agreed that it would be a good decision financially but my dad would never allow me to live with a guy unless I'm married. He would rather have me live with a female friend (I've asked and a lot of them already found apartments and roommates and they are way more expensive) and pay more than allow me to live with my SO where we would split everything evenly and save a bunch of money.

My family isn't even religious and my dad has these messed up sexist and conservative views towards how women should live and act. He still refuses to call my SO my boyfriend after 2 years, instead calls him my friend. Honestly I think my older sister messed up everything for me because she NEVER asked my dad for his permission to let her live with her bf, so she ran off with him and soon after dropped out of college(they are still together 5 years and going strong).My father was angry at her for over a year for disobeying him and he hated her boyfriend for awhile.

 I feel like my father thinks I will end up like my sister and completely abandon my education which I never intend to, I'm already in too much debt to do so anyways. I understand that I'm the youngest and he still might feel very overprotective and probably worries about me being irresponsible and getting pregnant. It hurts that he seems to think so poorly of me, I've been much more successful than my older sister, I've been very academically driven, worked part time, got into the best school in the state and it's still not enough to prove myself to him. I'm grateful that he is helping me through college by paying part of my tuition and my apartment and I really do want to help him financially. 

My family struggles financially, my dad is the only source of income and he always urges me to find the cheapest way through college (we don't receive any Fafsa bc my mom could work but she refuses to bc she has diabetes..)

My mom suggested that we could just lie to my dad, that I'm living on my own and I would move in with him. The problem is that my dad is not that dumb, he will want to come over and see the studio, and probably visit me more often since I would be on my own then my SO would have to constantly move his things out to his brothers whenever my dad comes around.

My SO's mother (who also think's my dad is being ridiculous) suggested that he should just propose to me if that will get my dad to allow me living with him. She's been nothing but very supportive of our relationship and she's very open minded. (Although I was flattered that his mother is so supportive of us, I do not favor this plan because we do not want to be moving in that direction until we graduate and start paying off all of our debts).

211,2jasow,"So very recently, I became engaged to my wonderful partner of 6 years. We have two children together, and this proposal has been eagerly anticipated by my family for a long time. 

Part of me is totally over the moon and ecstatic to finally plan a wedding with the person I love so much. The other part of me is totally devastated because my mom has turned into a complete psycho, and not only isn't happy for me, but has now written off my future husband. To top it all off, she has started rallying family members to her side, so now I get to contend with calls from them (my fucking family is beyond intrusive, as I'm finding out), and hear why I should essentially force my future husband to smooth things over with her. So here's the story:

Saturday morning, we go do family photos with my father (moms ex) and his wife (they've been married for several years, my mom adores her, they get along great, my mom and father tolerate eachother, and occasionally share a laugh. Before this moment, everything had been calm and harmonious with everyone). To clarify, my father and his wife have quite a passion for photography and have awesome cameras. The idea was they would take our annual fall photos of my little family, so we'd have some great shots of my kids growing up. Now, during this photo shoot, my SO decided that he would use this time where we were in our special spot, having essentially professional photos taken, to pop the question. There were no intentional exclusions on his part...he simply had this ring he's been sitting on for nearly a week, and felt this would be the best time to do it. I said yes, of course, we got a few great photo's of our engagement, everything was grand.

Fast forward to the evening, when I was FINALLY able to get a hold of my mom and stepdad. I convinced them to stop by our place, so I could share our news ( I was insistent that the news be shared in person not over the phone or text, and absolutely not on social media). I was unbelievably wired and excited to tell my mom especially, because, well, it's my mom and we have typically been fairly close...and this is a huge moment for a mother and daughter (or at least, I thought it was)...I was basically bouncing when they came to the door. They walk in and I immediately tell them. My mom hugged us both and then wanted to know details.

Right off the bat, she figured out that my father and his wife were there taking photo's-so her mood darkened, but she still seemed relatively happy. My stepfather catches this and tries to change the subject by saying Let's give credit where credit is due-I actually kept my mouth shut when *** (My SO) asked for hand a few days ago. This is where my mom completely loses control. She screams at him for not telling her. For knowing and keeping her out of the loop. Me and my SO sit there stunned at first, trying to determine if this freak out was actually happening, when my SO speaks up and says I explicitly told him to NOT say anything. This unravels her more, and she makes reference to being told anyways. He stands his ground and says no, I wanted to ask just the dads (I consider them both to be my dads and I've always counted myself very lucky to have such a great family set up that I could do so), and then we wanted to tell you in person first. She just keeps repeating how she can't believe my stepfather kept her out of the loop, blah blah blah. At this point, I'm pretty upset, so I excuse myself to go to the washroom to have a moment. Unfortunately, when I'm upset, no matter how hard I want to hide it, my body betrays me and I turn bright-red, and my eyes instantly go blood shot. I compose myself, come out of the washroom, and my mom starts in on me WHY ARE YOU CRYING?! I can't even speak at this point because I'm about to burst into tears and SO says Because you're completely turning a good day into something else and your reaction to not being told first is ridiculous. At this point, she completely flies off the handle, screams at us all to have a nice fucking life, then storms out. 
So, to recap so far, the day I'm engaged, literally hours after the event, the person I'm most excited to share it with in the whole world, not only has not shown any excitement for me, but has at this point turned the whole thing into something about her, and now my kids, who are not ever subjected to these kind of outbursts are confused and beyond upset. I'm a sobbing mess. My kids are screaming. My step dad is trying to calm the kids down. My mom has taken off. SO is trying to comfort me. So while this is happening, she comes back a few minutes later. Storms back in, says Sorry. I just don't think it was right I was excluded. I'm the mother AND the father, and I just don't think it's right. Sorry I wrecked your day (Her whole apology was spit out more than spoken, and probably the most insincere apologies I've ever heard in my life). As she stood there, essentially glaring at us, my SO says calmly and quietly Please leave. I don't think anything can be sorted out right now while everyone is so raw and upset..Just..please leave right now

At this point her jaw drops and she says she can't believe she's being kicked out. She looks at me to I guess say no that's ok or something like that, because I just stare at her and shake my head no. I couldn't spend another second with her. She starts screaming for my step dad to get downstairs and go with her and he says No, I'm not leaving right now. Go get a coffee and cool down or something

Apparently, she went and sat in my driveway sobbing for...some amount of time, then finally sent enough texts to my dad to get him to go with her. 

They leave, and I just feel...destroyed. Despite her ruining the moment, and casting an ugly shadow over a beautiful day, despite being a total monster, my SO says that he feels bad that she was so upset that she felt excluded (which, he reiterated was not the intention at all) and that she was probably mostly mad that my father was there for it and she wasn't. I was so mad and upset at this point, I tell him that doesn't matter. It's not about her, but she made it so. And for that, I'm furious. My phone the whole time, is going off and beeping non stop. My mom is sending me message after message that basically said I'm SOrry FUCK, I SAID IM SORRY, WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME!? then What can I do to make this better?

I responded with ...nothing will make this moment better. But I'm wiling to discuss ways this doesn't happen in the future. One of the things I won't do is sit here all night texting back and forth like 13 year olds. I'd be open to talking once everyone cools down. If you have such little control over your emotions, than maybe you should consider talking to someone and getting help for that. As far as what took place today, I'm upset that you made this about you. You had no right, and to be honest, the big picture isn't whether you were told first or not, it was that it was important ***(SO) ask my dads permission, because that's something I've always wanted. You get lots of mom knows first things, this wasn't one of them. You got to know first in person. Why does the rest matter? You have a crazy sense of entitlement. 

Since I didn't want to leave it at that, we went out for a few hours as a family, and then I called her and asked her If it was alright if we could come so we could talk. The talk was essentially me watching her sob, and feeling sorry for herself. I didn't pander to it, but I also didn't sit there emotionless and robotic. I tried discussing what underlying issues there were. I got nothing.

So I tried the next day. Nothing.

The third day I tried, and I got a total unleashed verbal diarrhea from her which mainly focused on: 1-how my biological father is a piece of shit who didn't deserve to do my photos, she should have been there, not him, etc etc.
2-My Future husband is an arrogant dick head with no respect for me or anyone else. He is borderline abusive and I only stick with him because he's emotionally beaten me down to agree with what he says and because I must feel like I won't do any better. Also, he is a shitty father to my son and has no patience for him and that the idea of us having more children made her sick because she doesn't think he can handle anymore (This is incredibly offensive to me because I spent many years with someone who WAS abusive, and did treat me terribly-and the man I'm going to marry is completely unlike him. It's because of him (My current SO) that I am able to look in the mirror and feel good about myself. It's because of him encouraging me to do what I need and want to be healthy and happy..in regards to work, school, even hobbies, that I feel content with life. He listens to everything I say intently-and contributes thoughtfully to what I have to say. He treats me as his equal. She knows I'm sensitive toward the abuse thing, and I felt like it was a shitty dig for no good reason. As far as his skills in the parenting department. We are tough parents, but fair and loving. We are not physical with our kids and make a point not to yell. Raised voices, yes from time to time, but what parent doesn't. I've never seen someone so involved in their children's life as my SO and my own mother has commented on it in the past. This is a grasping at straws thing, but a thing that she said, nonetheless). 
3. Since that wasn't enough to trash the men in my life, she continued on to inform me that I was  liar, I was selfish, and ultimately, everyone in my life walks on eggshells around me because I'm moody. At one time, yes, that would be true. The moody bit anyways. I did some extensive work on myself which involved some pretty intensive counselling (you know, because being encouraged to get healthy mentally by my SO is a total red flag of an abuser *lol*) and have come so far, I never thought I could be ...such a stable person. The selfish lying bit..I'm not really sure what that is, but ok, maybe I told a white one to her sometime and she has dwelled on it for a decade. I honestly have no idea.
 
I accepted that she must have built up resentment toward my father. I offered to rearrange any family get togethers so she doesn't have to be subjected to him. I told her she doesn't have to be required to get along with him, and if she wants nothing to do with him, that's her choice. I will do what I can to make it easier for everyone...but then someone at sometime is going to always be excluded and that was just a fact.

I suggested she baby sit my children less, as she claims part of her outburst is related to being tired.

She insists that she doesn't want either of those things to happen. She doesn't want separate family functions. She doesn't want anyone else to babysit if she's able to do so. 

She has also said she will no longer come to my house until SO apologizes for kicking her out (WTF?!). She claims that her and I are fine, and that she is happy with me in a way, but he kicked her out after excluding her, and she wasn't going to be able to get past that.

So I guess...I'm just wondering, what the fuck do I do? I'm so confused. I'm so hurt. I'm so frustrated and exhausted. I feel like no matter what I do, it's not the right thing. I feel like I shouldn't have to do anything-why am I being punished, for being happy?! I'm allowed to be happy...I'm not a bad person! Do I cut this person out of my life? Do I cut ties with my own mother and ultimately, have my children suffer (they LOVE their grandma). ? Counselling is apparently not an option as she has made it abundantly clear she doesn't require it (though, I beg to differ.)

What do I do about my SO? He's just as hurt, but hiding it much better. And as far as kicking her out he simply asked her to leave until cooler heads could prevail. If he didn't do it, I would have. Am I terrible daughter? Ah...I'm so...twisted up over this. How do I get past it??

I'm also writing on my phone.

Me and my boyfriend have been dating for about 3/4 months, and everything has been wonderful untill recently because I start to see things in him I definitely don't want in my life.

He's drinking alot (usually from friday to sunday and sometimes in the middle of the week), snorting amphetamine, smoking weed, and fighting to mention a few. He also has a daughter who's 1 yr old, she's with her mother though.
I have been talking to him alot about this, and he always promises to be a good boy, but everytime he gets wasted and end's up in a different party. None of my friends understand why I'm not just dumping his sorry ass, but it's not that simple.
He's one of the few men I have met who do not harm women in ANY situation and he absolutely HATES cheating, plus we fit together so well.
We have the same humour, he makes me feel beautiful and sexy, he can always make me laugh and I absolutely adore his daughter.
Plus if I try to keep distance for a while he starts bombing me with miss you messages and calling me whenever I'm not doing anything special. He just makes me feel happy when he is just with me, since he usually ignores me alot when we are at the same party.

He has been promising me not to drink as much as he used to, but I haven't seen any change in his behaviour the little time we have together (we live maybe 10 km away from eachother and neither of us have driving license (I'm still head over heels in debt after my mother left me with the bills for the house she owns), so he usually calls me or comes by in the evening and sleeps at my place. He's really caring when he wants to, and says the only thing holding him in our town is me and his daughter, but still he drinks about every weekend and hangs out with really suspicious people.
I was with him the whole weekend (I was sober) because I wanted to look after him. He ended up in a fight with two guys, and got cuts and a bump in his forehead. I was shocked since I have always had respect for the fact that he defended himself when it came to fighting, there he actually got up from the sofa and started shoving this another guy, and they ended up in destroying alot in the appartment we were in.

When he was done there the only thing he was talking about was drinking more. He got a driver to drive him over to another party, and me home since they were so close. He said he was going to call me in one hour since he was only going to check on his buddy who was at that party, he called me maybe two hours later, but I was asleep and couldn't hear it, now he's battery is dead and I have no idea what to do...

517,2ns7nr,"Ill try to keep this short and concise. This girl is awesome, and I love being around her. We have a lot in common and text every day (but only 10-15 texts). The problem is that her parents dont want her to date and so we keep our relationship a secret. This makes going on dates hard, and on top of that she has her own friends and is very busy.We only hang out once or twice a week and for only 3 hours at a time. Its hard to include myself with her friends because we have to keep our relationship a secret, and the solution to all of our issues with not spending enough time with each other I feel can be solved by asking her parents if we can actually date. I asked her last time we hung out if she thought about asking her parents about this, and she said that she has thought about it and the answer is still no. (she wont ask under fear that they will say no and ban her from every seeing me). 

I very much trust this girl and she has said that she wants to date me and that she wants to spend time with me, but the lack of affection is tough. I know she is attracted to me, but it hurts my self esteem when she hangs out with her friends and makes me feel like low priority.

 I don't have an issue attracting/talking to girls, but I've never been interested in a relationship and I'm trying to adapt to find somebody for something longer term as opposed to something casual.


 So I'm 18 years old and I'm just about to finish my first term of my first year at university. I've always been very reluctant to commit, I've never had a 'serious' girlfriend, but I've had say 6 or 7 casual 'relationships'.


Since joining university I've been going out ALLOT and I'm starting to get bored of casual encounters. 


 So how do I meet somebody for a relationship? I'm pretty active in  a number of societies and I'm on the rugby team which means I meet lots of girls who come to games etc. But It is  a completely different enviroment to just grabbing some girl in a nightclub. I don't understand how you go about getting to the point where you start a romantic relationship with somebody, when I go out everything is quite structed and formulaic, just dance with somebody, kiss, go out for a smoke, wait for closing time, go home and fuck. Perhaps keep in contact if I want to have sex with them again. 



But with this isn't at all formulaic and I'm completely confused as to how to escalate with somebody In my 'social circle' who I see more regularly.

Recently, my girlfriend was diagnosed with depression and OCD. She has felt depressed regularly for quite a long time before her diagnosis. 

A lot stems from her childhood, her father left the family and has been verbally abusive to her and her two sisters and has even broken into their house with his new partner, causing him to get a restraining order. They haven't seen their father in over 5 years. Their mother also suffered about of heavy depression in the past.

The biggest problem with my girlfriend's OCD is that she is analyzing everything and anything (people she sees on tv, childhood friendships, how she feels during sexual activity) to work out whether or not she is gay. She has told me that she has questioned it before, from as young an age as 14/15.

She has started going to cognitive behavioral therapy, all the signs seem to show that she is not gay. She says she feels sick thinking about being sexually active with other women, and she says that our physical relationship still turns her on. The OCD makes her question and analyse everything in her life which really brings her down, it drives her crazy.

I know nothing about supporting people with OCD, I've comforted her in any way I can, given her a shoulder to cry on, a person to vent her feelings to, and told her she still means the world to me, which she does! I would appreciate any insight into OCD in particular and how I can make things easier for her.

594,39w051,"Sorry for the length, and let me know if this better belongs in r/sex. Okay, so my ex of nearly two years and I broke up last month because of college (we both finished freshmen year despite age difference). I felt like she had been more reserved with me and two weeks before coming home I confronted her about her recent change in mood and she admitted that the distance had made her love fade for me. I was feeling it too and planned to end things in the summer, she admitted that was her plan too, but since we had told each other we no longer loved each other there was no point in continuing. 


However, while I'm sad that it's over, I'm happy it ended because I know I can do **much** better than her. I had a fun with her and don't regret a thing, but I realized that I couldn't see myself with her in the long run and she had a long history of mental problems which made things difficult and I felt like I was doing all of the work to keep the relationship going. The thing is, she was my first. But she'd already been with four other guys before me.


I shouldn't care she's fucking someone else now, because I don't love her anymore and know I will find new love eventually but it makes me feel so gross thinking about it. I know from a mutual friend that she feels empty inside and using sex to make up for the lack of love in her life (me), but it doesn't make it easier for me to know. I've been extremely sexually frustrated the past month but I feel fantastic otherwise and content with my life. I'm pretty sure she stopped working out since the break up and I when I saw her recently she looked worse than I remembered, and I've been working out tons the past month and look better than ever. I long since deleted her number and blocked her on social media btw. 


One thing I've became good at over the last year is removing emotions from decision making. I still want to be her friend and I knew she would have strong feelings for me again once she saw me so I could have gotten laid, but I put all that aside knowing the right thing to do is not see her. Plus, I only have enough blood for one of my heads and if I saw her I don't think I'd have done my thinking with the right one. 


Regardless, I wish I didn't feel so disgusted thinking about her with someone else. I know it's not an insecurity thing. I'm in fantastic shape, very smart, speak four languages, and a very talented person doing great things with my life, while she isn't doing anything with hers except smoking pot and drinking (not that there's anything inherently wrong with that, but again she's only 17). Of course I have some small insecurities, don't we all, but I love myself and know I'll be successful in finding love again and in life overall. Not only that, but I have a 7.5 (19 cm) penis, and according to her was very good in bed and would made her come every time (she had never come during PIV with anyone before me) so whoever she's railing now statistically has a 99% chance of having a smaller dick than me. That sounds really vain and I don't mean to offend anyone, it just gives me at least some comfort knowing that whoever she's banging now is most likely less endowed.


The problem is that I don't have a chance to get laid myself really. I think that if I had the opportunity to get laid I'd feel better, but the chances of that for a long time are very slim. I'm a West Point cadet and not only is the academy 85% male, but I'm also not interested in any of the girls who go there. There was one really cute girl I liked and spent time with one on one, we got along great and I thought things could go somewhere but after getting to know her she told me Obama is the Antichrist and gay people should all be put down for their sins which turned me off completely and I cut contact with her because of it. It was fucked up. 


Currently, I'm on leave but have had no success getting laid. All anyone does in my town is drink and smoke pot. I can't smoke pot (because Army) and I don't drink (bad family history with alcohol) so I've been finding it very hard to meet girls with similar interests who aren't crazy. 


The one bit of hope I have is a girl I ran into (literally) my first night back home late May. Oh my god is she beautiful. At least a 9/10 if not straight up 10/10. Also incredibly smart and we have the same major (my ex dropped out of college after one semester). Her dad was in the army for 20 years too, so I've got that going for me which is a plus. We had a nice chat and exchanged numbers, but she was leaving the next morning to go abroad on a school trip (just my luck) so we couldn't hang out long. She came back yesterday, and told me she got me a gift! She seems interested in me (we were snapchatting during her trip and obviously the gift is a good sign), and we even have a nice date set up for tomorrow. She also looks very different from my ex which is important. Problem is that I leave in 10 days to go back to the Army and won't be home until Christmas at least, so my chances with her are seem pretty slim.



The only thing that makes me feel better is knowing that in the end things will be okay for me. I'm getting a free education at one of the most prestigious colleges in the U.S. and guaranteed a well paying job after graduation that opens up pretty much any door for my future. I just don't know when that end is. Even if things do go well with this girl over the next 10 days, I don't know if I'll be able to get the images of my ex hooking up guys on one night stands. I still have three years at West Point and then five as an officer, so how do I move on knowing there's a chance I won't see any action (romantic, that is) for a long time? It kills me to think about, it's stupid stupid jealousy on a superficial level. I'm not jealous of her life or who she is at all, just jealous that I may not get laid for years while she's already sleeping around. But how do I not feel jealous of this?

The event convinced me it was time to finally separate myself from him before something else happens.

In my original post I asked how I should go about cutting him off. The consensus was that because we work together and will still have to see each other, I should slowly phase him out. This seemed like good advice but now I'm not sure that it's the best option.

The incident was unexpectedly traumatic for me. I've been having trouble sleeping the past couple nights because the event keeps playing over and over in my head. After that, I'll start thinking about all the other shit I've had to deal with in my life and won't be able to stop my rushing thoughts. I feel like I'm going crazy.

Because of this, I feel that I need to cut ties with my friend *now.* He's always been nice to me and tried to keep me out of his crazy shit so I have no fear of him retaliating as someone suggested in my last post. My only concern is that I don't want to come off as an asshole and hurt his feelings. I know, however, that I need to do this for myself regardless of how it may affect him.

We finally moved into a new house about 4 months ago on a 2 year lease, We both found stable equal paying careers.  We have 2 puppies that are just about a year each that we both love to death.  We are more entwined then some married couples I know, Car loans, Student loans, Lease agreements, Joint bank accounts,  Everything has both our names on it.  We were looking at rings 6 months ago.  We have had some ups and down but overall we have had a great relationship and we both know that we care about each other.


Since I was so distraught about the break up I called off work Friday to talk to her about it.


I suggested that we live as friends and try to grow personally and see if we can reignite our old flame.  She agreed to try.  I have moved into the spare bedroom and into the 2nd bathroom.  I am not allowed to tell her I love her anymore.  We are allowed to hug, as friends.  Not sure if that is helping or hurting but it is a temporarily physical relief from all the tension.  We have been getting along, She knows this is the hardest thing I have ever done.

We met each other shortly before going off to college and once we got there, we ended up in Air Force ROTC together. However, for various reasons, the two of us ended up dropping out of the program. When we reflected on our experiences in ROTC, both of us expressed joy and satisfaction with the program, but we highly disliked a large portion of the group mentality involved. She would often refer to it as being in a cult.



As our relationship went on, I noticed as she began to lean more and more towards right wing economic politics (i.e. Libertarianism, Anarcho-Capitalism, etc...) and she developed a greater dislike for the government, and by extension the military. While I agree with her on many things, I still feel that there is a purpose for the government and for the military, and I'm not ashamed of my decision. 



We've been broken up for almost a year now, and both of us have moved on. I've been in other relationships and she's been with the same guy since August. She dropped out of school to live with him and join him and his online based company. The guy seems like a good guy, but I also know that 1), he has cut off many ties with people in his life including his parents, and 2), he is an anarchocapitalist (ancap). The last time that I talked to my ex, she told me that she had completely embraced the ancap philosophy and even though it was the first time that we had skyped in months, instead of asking about how I'd been, she made the whole conversation about why I joined the military. At the end of our conversation, she had tears in her eyes, and she told me later that she cried after her talk.

She was above all my absolute best friend, and she was there with me through some of the toughest challenges of my life so far.

I miss the intellectual debate that she brought to my life, and I miss being able to see her face. After our last conversation, she told me that she didn't think that she could be friends with someone who was a part of the oppressive arm of the state. She didn't even want to be in contact with me, and she cut me out of her life completely.



From an ideological standpoint, I can understand that to a certain extent. But after all of the history that we had, and especially since she moved halfway across the country with this new guy, I would think that it would be nice to keep people in your life that you know for a fact care about and love you. 



It just kills me that after all that we went through, she won't even speak to me when I've done nothing wrong. 



So I'm trying to stop thinking about how much this hurts me, but I can't. And taking a fuck you attitude isn't my style either. I don't miss her as a girlfriend; I've got someone much better now.

As per 'Seven Principles of a Highly Successful Marriage' I do think it's important to know the challenges and successes of my wife and I do take an interest in some aspects of her work-life. Objectively however, my interest often wanes quicker than the conversation comes to a natural end.


My original thought was to illustrate how I find the personal 'life' aspects to her day alot more captivating than the minutiae of administration and business systems. This has had more success, but unfortunately not enough.


She is upset that the conversations feel forced and fake to her.



This is not a complete deal-breaker and it's something we've spoken calmly about a few times: this must be a common issue among couples, but neither of us have the correct answer in our toolset for this one.

953,395tmp,"I have a very good friend who is in an open relationship, let’s call her Sara. She is married to a man, but they have an agreement that allows her to sleep with women as long as she asks for permission from him first. She is not allowed to sleep with men. 

I’m totally fine with this – every relationship has a different set of guidelines and expectations. Whatever works, works.

The issue is lately she has been very aggressive in her pursuits of bedding women. I’m a lesbian (Sara and I actually briefly dated in high school) so I have a lot of friends in the LGBT community. Once Sara finds out that one of my friends is into girls she then proceeds to ask for “permission” if she can sleep with them and usually ends up doing that.
Additionally, she often makes sexual comments about our past sexual history in front of others.

My best friend is straight, and she is even constantly making sexual comments about her and her friends… whether they are straight or lesbian.

Yesterday, she basically asked me if it was ok if she hung out  with my ex-girlfriend for the sole purpose of sleeping with her.

I have no issues with polyamory or open relationships, but I’m starting to find her behavior very disrespectful and I feel as if she is becoming a liability to hang out with.  It’s to the point that we have to warn our friends in advance that she might *try* to sleep with them.

Am I over-reacting or is she sort of out of line here? I spoke to my best friend about it and she agreed that Sara is being a bit disrespectful, but we are not sure if this is just because we aren’t too familiar/comfortable with the swinger lifestyle. She is the only person we know in an open relationship.

578,2d1v8f,"I have been dating a woman much older than I am. It started off purely sexual, but over time both of us seemed to be getting closer and more emotionally attached. Early in the relationship, I found out that she has been married for almost 20 years and has 4 children with this man. This man, however, beats her and constantly and stirs up fights around the house and in front of the kids. She tells me he is a good father to the kids, but that he could care less about what they do. 

She married just so she could escape her hometown and has been unfaithful to him even before they got married. She won't divorce because her occupation doesn't provide financial stability or benefits, and because her and her husband basically live separate lives, she doesn't feel the rush to divorce but she also pays for groceries, gas, toys, etc. all from her own money. 

After being together for almost a year, she has told me many times that she is the happiest she's ever been and that she feels more with me than anyone she has ever been with and no longer feels empty and alone. She has told me many stories about her past that make me uneasy and worried when she decides to go out with friends to bars, but by spending so much time with her I have seen that this woman I am with now isn't the same woman she's told me about as last summer. We spend almost every day together. We work at the same facility so I get to see her a lot, and so over time her kids have gotten to know me pretty well and even play with me or sit with me to have lunch when I have free time. 

Her husband knows she is seeing someone because he has gone through phone records and knows my number. I have received a phone call telling me to leave her alone and that She still loves me, she just doesn't know it yet. Divorce papers were in process about two weeks ago, but a few days after that he has supposedly gotten saved by the church so he is shoving religion down her throat to convince her to change and become a happy family again with him. She continues to tell him that it is over and that she's happy he's saved so that it might make him a better dad, but he doesn't pay attention to that. 

Sitting down with her at dinner last night, I had to bring up the series of uncomfortable dreams I have been having about her and her past/present situation. After me talking for what seems to be an hour, I finally ask her if she has had any sexual or intimate moments with him since being with me. She told me that they last had sex in January just so she could see if there was anything left in the relationship, and she was repulsed and uncomfortable the whole time. I got upset and told her I was done with our relationship, but after talking it out, I realized her position and how after being married for 20 years, divorce is tough and I would've probably done the same thing. But she told me that was the last time ever that anything between them would happen, but I told her nothing is final to me unless the divorce papers are signed. We spent the night together that night, but the I didn't feel the same way after she told me that... 

I feel like *I'm* the one who was cheated on, in a weird and twisted way.. I know I still love her, no doubt at all; she makes me feel love deeper than anyone has ever made me felt. I want to believe she's a different person, but until there is a divorce, things are hard for me but I still want to stay with her even if she has a crazy past and a crap-ton of baggage. I love her so much, but I want to know what you guys/girls think of the situation. Sorry for the long read.

318,38zt49,"Hello there. I was in a really bad relationship for a couple of years about 6 or 7 years ago. It ended but we remained friends and continued to live together (which I know was a big mistake.) About two years ago, I finally cut the last ties with her (as Facebook friends) after she tried to drive a wedge between me and my current girlfriend (who has been the best girlfriend ever.)

It's been a couple of years now. My girlfriend and I were having a conversation about my past, and afterwards I decided to write her an email because it was easier to express my feelings. Here's a snippet:

&gt; She hated her parents one day, then loved them the next, then got in large arguments with everyone and asked me to help smooth things over, then got mad at me over nothing and it just never ended. I was constantly walking on eggshells. I was told that I don't want other people to know we're together while we were dating. I know she told people that my good quality was intelligence and sometimes funny, but it wasn't looks. I wasn't good enough (her words.) I think I was a relationship that she could write about and pretend was a fairytale when in reality she just made fun of me and pushed me away. When she drank she wanted everyone to know how SILLY she got when she drank and then wanted to make out with girls and laugh at me. Physical contact was off the table pretty much all the time, the only difference being when she wasn't my sole focus.

I realized after writing that out (and talking to my gf and hearing her reaction of oh my god, it was so abusive) that it really was a bad relationship. I started reading posts and blogs and websites, and realized that she hit a lot of the bullet points of abusive relationships - she withheld physical contact, made fun of me to my face and in front of others, I always found myself apologizing to others for her behavior and trying to defend her, and honestly I dreaded being around her because I knew something dramatic would happen. It wasn't until I pulled away from her that suddenly I got apologies and promises to do better. I finally moved out of our shared house and things got mostly better. She still stayed a part of my life, and it wasn't until I could see her messaging my girlfriend with lies (and then lying to me when she thought my gf wasn't around) that I fully saw it. I cut contact that day and never looked back.

I'm letting all this out because reading lots of websites doesn't show too much for guys who are in emotionally or verbally abusive relationships. I find myself struggling with talking about it because I feel like I'm weak for letting it happen and for not getting out sooner. It still affects me today subconsciously. Whenever there's any sort of disagreement with my girlfriend, I become super passive and apologetic and I'm quick to say it's my fault. I let myself get on edge like before even though my girlfriend is SO lovely.

How can I move past these feelings? Is it normal to feel what I feel?

It's a long soap opera... but I live a silver spoon of a life and love my parents. My Mother [52 f] is the spiritual and caring house wife and never flinched in her relationship with my Dad. 

5 years ago, I went on a trip to London with my Father. Giving only the bare necessities, my Dad stupidly decided to ditch me from a festival we were at to get with a women he'd been talking to for the past 2 days (who I found out he knew for some time prior). I felt weird the whole time. Got a 'sense' that something was wrong. When his work pals pawned his absence off on childish excuses I rushed back to the hotel. Found him mid-action. I'll say to you what I said to my Mom after she found out I witnessed this: It did not scar me in any unimaginable way, I did not walk away with PTSD or anything like that. I don't need a counselor to walk me through steps of grief. I dealt with that all on my own. I talked with him right after (she packed up and left while I went the restroom--only thing I could think to do) and he was so stupidly apologetic. 

My dad is a powerful businessman. One does not get to where he is without being strategic and intelligent--which is why such a stupid move seemed so out of place. The first thing I did was address how much of a mistake this was. The second was to immediately forgive him and tell him I'm more concerned for him and Mom. I yelled at him and told him to not mess up a good thing and that I would not tell Mom. He seemed mad at me for this. He was angry that I wasn't going to punish him. I didn't really get it at the time. I was selfish, I wanted my life to go back the way it was. I basically got my wish.

Fast forward to this last December, my Dad says he's going to lunch with a work buddy and that he'd be back late. My Aunt gave my Mother a text saying she'd seen my Dad with another women walking out of a swanky hotel downtown. I used to think my Mom was really bitchy. Always up my Dad's ass, not letting him breathe on the small things. I always thought it crazy that they were together... but it all started to make sense. The reason my Mom's first thought was to jump to cheating was for more past incidents. She immediately confronted him. He confessed on the spot. He'd been leading a relationship on and off again for 3 years with another married women [unknown age, my guess is younger than him by 10 years]. He confessed to London ... and then I found out he cheated on her a full decade and change prior right when my baby brother was born. 

My world view of him was broken after London. I thanked him, silently. I needed a kick in the ass. I needed to see my hero fall. But, this? This was hard. It was like watching a cripple get pushed down and, when you try to pick him up, you find out he's been pretending this whole time for attention. 

My Dad lied to me. He made a promise to me in London that this would never happen again. I made an assumption to myself that it hadn't ever happened before due to how sloppy this was. I was so hurt to be wrong. But, I didn't need anyone. I just got my first major job, I just got out of college, I'm moving, my best friend's been 6 feet under 1 year June 3rd, KIA in Enduring Freedom, and I've got a longtime girlfriend I intended to engage in the next few months. With all these distractions, I just wanted to be there for them when they needed me. My mom would talk to me once a day, hysterical. She begged me for a negative opinion of my Dad. But I can't. He has been everything I needed--mostly lately.

Growing up he played the fatherly role that was hands off. Supplied everything necessary and played the role. He was an excellent Dad unless you wanted to throw the ball or learn small niche things. I know he knew this. He would try to make up for it a lot. But, nobody like's being smothered. Instead of a steady stream of 'Dad'. I would get a condensed 1 weekend a month smothering of him teaching me how to change oil, throw a ball, ride a bike etc. Then work would call. He worked 80 hours a week etc. Fast forward to my last 5 years. I've been running through a rough time in school and motivation to wake up for the day. He pushed me, kicking and screaming, through it. He did an amazing job and I've him to thank for my new life outlook. At this pinnacle time of validation for my upbringing, I was being asked to smear him by the victim, my Mother.

I wanted to side with her, but I felt compelled to take a neutral stance. She would wimper that she did everything she could, she told him she loved him every day, etc. I believe her, but that doesn't take away from the fact that he's human. I don't penalize the man for wanting something/someone else. I penalize him for tearing someone apart and taking the cowards way out by cheating.

When my Dad talks to me, he tears up every time. He's so sorry I had to see that. He's sorry for what he's done to this family. He wants it back so desperately. He wants to be punished. He gets mad when I downplay it (what am I supposed to do? It's not like I'm saying It's okay but when he's balling in my shoulder saying I screwed up I just sorta say Yeah. You did, but you gotta pick yourself up man.). He makes it sound like I'm giving him a pass, but, I'm not. It's just, I don't know what punishment he needs/wants. Or, more importantly, what I can give. I feel like, since I sat on this for 5 years, that I don't have a right to be mad at him. I gave that up. That was the price I paid the devil to make all of this go away in the short term.

On top of all this, I'm one of 3. My sister is older and knows. I spoke with her and my Mom passively accuses me of desensitizing her. I talked logically to her about how we need to handle this, and she's been less irrational about her anger. My Mom needed someone to scream and yell at with. I took that away from her. If there is any sorrow that I feel, it is this. My brother is 7 years younger, just graduated High School and has a full ride to College... he doesn't know a thing right now. 

Day to day, my Dad's texts make me cringe. He tiptoes between trying to get back to normal with me (huge baseball fan and we used to talk every day about it; also sends me life/job advice and we discuss deeply about work philosophy) and embarrassingly apologetic. We used to go to a baseball game 2-3 times a season. I've been to a dozen so far this season. It's the same feeling I got when I was younger and he smothered me once a weekend. I know he sees his time running out as my Mom is moving ever closer to an obvious decision. So, he's trying to milk the time. But, every time I get with him alone, it comes back up. I can't enjoy it, I can't ignore it for an hour. Not that I think I should. I, just, I want my freaking Dad. I want him back so bad...

...Now comes Father's Day. I get along with him just fine, topically. Like, we have dinner once a week as a family and such, I have a beer with him and laugh about the baseball team. My question, outside of how to deal with him day to day, is what I should do/get him for Father's day and how should I treat it? I feel like this is his last as a 'whole' family (I know that's only literally true). I know my Mom will put on a good face and let us do what we want etc. but what sends him the message of Hey, I love you, I'm here for you, and though I don't agree with what you did; can't walk with you as you go through this; can't understand why you did it, I will always be on the other side of this as your Son and friend. I always got him shit gifts (or chipped in on gifts my Mom bought for him--though I doubt that's happening this year) for Father's day and just played golf. Should I just ignore everything and do the same as every year? Should I do something special? Does he deserve it? Would I be humiliating my Mother by even doing something at all?

Thank you for reading the whole thing.

711,1h6vyt,"My ex-girlfriend [22F] broke up with me [25M] about 1.5 months ago. We were dating for almost three years. There were a lot of reasons why she broke up with me but it came down to her needing to work on herself (she has a lot of issues that stem from her childhood) and that our relationship got boring. I also didn't give her any signs that I was committed to her (I didn't get her a ring or any kind of jewelry). I agree that we both got lazy and comfortable with each other in the relationship. And I also understand how she didn't feel wanted because I didn't show any signs of commitment.

I was really upset when she broke up with me because I did not want to split up. I asked her if she would be willing to get back together and give me a chance at showing her that I'm willing to be committed. She told me she doesn't want to be dating anyone right now because she needs to work on herself. She can't give 100% of her if she doesn't even have 100% of her (again, personal issues she's trying to work through). She's not willing to date anyone right now, and doesn't plan on dating or hooking up with anyone.

She did tell me that I'm her best friend and that she feels comfortable around me and can be herself around me (she can't be herself around the majority of her other friends). She wants to be friends because she doesn't want to lose me. She loves me and cares about me. I told her that I didn't want to only be friends, I wanted to be with her. I can't be her friend if she is going to start dating other guys, it would break my heart. Again she said she has no plans on dating anyone right now.

This is my dilemma. I could either let her go, and not risk getting hurt in the case that she starts dating someone (eventually). Or I can be her friend, hang out on a regular basis with her for the next couple months and show her a good time. Show her that a relationship with me would be fun and exciting and show her what she's missing out on. I know what she likes to do for fun and what makes her happy.

If I were to be friends with her, she said she would be honest with me about if she were to start seeing someone or sleeping with someone. I figure this way I could break off the friendship if she started seeing someone. I'm definitely not going to pause my dating life...I'll start making an attempt to see other people in case I get shut down at the end of all this.

I want to point out that I wasn't really snooping when I saw the pictures - we used each others' laptops, phones, &amp; tablets freely and I thought neither of us had anything to hide. The downloads folder was on his desktop and when I clicked on the photos, and I (stupidly) thought, Oh look, a bunch of pictures! Probably from our last vacation! Boy, was I wrong...

This happened on a weekend morning, while Chet was still asleep (it was normal for me to wake up before him and go on his computer or watch TV). After seeing the pictures, I quietly put my clothes on and left to go back to my place. I texted him saying something like I found something on your computer that clearly wasn't meant for me to see, and I feel like you've betrayed my trust in a big way. 

A short while later Chet woke up, realized what I had seen &amp; where I was, he came over. He had a key to my place. Chet didn't deny anything (would've been futile - I'm not stupid), and told me that - yes, he cheated on me, yes, he's hooked up with guys, and, he's been fooling around with men since college and I'm the only person in the world who knows about it. He asked me not to tell any of our friends. I didn't really say anything, I was still in complete shock. I told him he should seek therapy. Then I told him to GTFO of my place and give me back my key. That was the last time we saw each other.

To give a little background on our relationship... we met and started hooking up about 2 1/2 years ago and were exclusively dating for about the past 2 years. We always had a great relationship - it felt very mature and I was really, ridiculously happy. I'd dated plenty of other guys before, but never felt as 100% in love as I did with Chet. We didn't live together, but we made an effort to sleep together every night and spent nearly all of our free time together. And although we'd agreed we're too young to get married (we both imagined we'd be closer to 30 before tying the knot), I truly thought he was the person I'd spend my life with. Clearly, I had no idea that he might be cheating on me, and I had *NO* idea that he might be gay or bi. Finding those pictures was, to say the least, extremely shocking.

Since then, I've tried to move on, and see the silver lining. I realize that he had no intention of ever telling me the truth - and that the coincidence of seeing the pictures may have ultimately saved me (additional) years of wasted time, and greater heartbreak. I've made an extra effort to hang out with girlfriends and embrace being single. I've also spent a lot of time asking God for strength and guidance (who wouldn't?). I also should point out that I haven't told most of my/our friends about the fact that there were men in the pictures (basically, I've told the entire story of him cheating, while leaving that detail out). Almost all of my girlfriends have boyfriends/fiances who are also friends with Chet. Keeping that secret has been a source a stress. I feel like most of friends really don't know the extent of what I'm going through.

Chet has called and texted me a handful of times, but aside from my arranging to pick up my things (under the condition that he wouldn't be home), we haven't spoken at all. He has said that he wants to apologize, but I haven't heard from him in almost three weeks. I don't think there is anything he could possibly say to make me feel better. Part of me wants to let him know how much I hate him, how I feel that he wasted two years of my life, and that he deserves nothing but to be miserable - but I don't know if that would make me feel better either.

All of this being said, I've tried dating other people, including a close friend, Mark, who says he is very into me and has been a huge source of emotional support since I found out. However, every time I am talking to a guy/going out with someone, I feel extremely guilty, anxious, sad, and frustrated for reasons I can't really explain. This is especially a problem in dating Mark, because he makes me really happy (he's amazing!!!!) and I really do want things to go well between us. I just want to move forward very badly, but don't know how. I know it hasn't been that long, and maybe all I need is time, but I don't want to waste another day feeling sad about Chet.

So r/relationships - any advice? Do you think I should arrange to talk to Chet, since it may give me closure? How can I handle dating new people? Anyone been through a similar experience? Just typing this all out has been helpful. Thanks everyone.

608,2b8nph,"I started dating a girl from my work in the beginning of 2012. Things were off to a rocky start right from the get go. We had a hard time making our relationship work and I had a hard time admitting to people at work that we were dating. I've always been a very private person and there are just some things about me that I would prefer that certain people didn't know. Regardless, I genuinely and sincerely liked this girl and sacrificed a lot of my privacy to try and make her happy.

We went through the year (we're both teachers so up until late June) with numerous we can't do this anymore's and calling it off. But each time we did that, we'd both mutually come back and tackle our problems with our relationship from different angles. There was a lot of talking and we communicated really well whenever we were talking about how do we make us better. 

Over the summer she lost her job and got hired in another district. I was so relieved by this and thought it was going to be really good for us. But even when we had some more time to ourselves, we seemed to keep hitting bumps in the road. 

Every time we would hit one of these bumps, I'd become initially exasperated. She would communicate with me what she was upset about and what she needed and I would try and make compromises but always felt like what I was saying wasn't good enough. Most of my life I've been battling the feeling of not feeling good enough and it definitely transpires in my relationship as well. 

I have had so many moments where I think to myself this isn't meant to be if it's going to be this hard and contemplate walking away from everything. But there have also been so many times where I find myself thinking there's nobody in the world I'd rather spend the rest of my life with. 

I feel like this may be a product of my inexperience. Before her, I had officially 1 girlfriend, and had only kissed 3 girls in total. She had been in relationships with 6 different guys and had been previous engaged. She tells me that she has never been in love with anybody like she has with me and that what we have is incredibly rare. But sometimes I don't know. Is it incredibly rare to find someone that you love unconditionally? I sort of put that question to the test.

We went on a break in January of this year and haven't been together since. During that time I went on dates with 6 different girls. Of those six, I went on second dates with 3 of them. Only two girls did I date more than 3 times, one I went on 5 dates with, the other 7. Nearly every time I was out with one of these girls I would think about past SO and would be unable to keep her from my mind. And whenever things got even relatively sexual, I would almost break down.

I had sex once with the girl that I went on 7 dates with and after that lost almost all interest in her and incessantly thought about my past SO.

I've contemplated therapy because at this point it's started to effect my life. I haven't tried reaching out to her yet because I am honestly scared. I love this girl but the back and forth we go through isn't good for either of us. What can I do? Does anybody have any advice for me?

My boyfriend has been freaking out a bit when it comes to sex, he has basically no previous experience, so this leads to problems when we actually do have sex. He's gone flaccid twice this past week, and continually struggles in the bedroom, but still REALLY wants to have sex. 

Last night my boyfriend went flaccid during sex, had a bit of a freak out, and then just left my house. I texted him this morning letting him know that everything was okay, he shouldn't be embarrassed, all of the above. I thought everything was going to be okay, but tonight when we hung out, he let me know that Sunday morning, he called up his ex girlfriend to discuss his intimacy problems, and what ME, his new girlfriend, could do to help him. 

As he's telling me this, he also lets me know that his ex wants to befriend me, and wants to go on a double date with her boyfriend and us. I'm pretty pissed about the situation. I understand staying friends with exes, but I'm not okay with my boyfriend talking to his ex girlfriend about his sex life.

428,3h055u,"We've been married for 5 years(dated 2yrs), this is my first marriage her second, she has 3 children from previous marriage (live with us full time), I have a child from a previous relationship.

After the first year intimacy problems started to develop we've been through discussion/fights/counselling and even switched meds (ADD, anti-depressants) to try and bring back things before we were married.  My wife during this time doesn't really view this as an issue, and has openly stated that because now we're married and knows I'm always there she doesn't feel she needs to affectionate or intimate.  I've often quipped the dogs get more affection than I do.  This alone causes tension between us, but the other issues have been piling up as well.  

Her children aged 16/12/11 have been a constant source of strife in our relationship causing a breakup previously before we got married.  As they've gotten older then strain they've placed on the thin balance we had is causing constant fights from difference in parenting styles, constant insubordination, lying which has led to CPS being called several times by her EX. This has almost cost me my job, but all complaints were dismissed by CPS.  Things were escalating in an attempt to diffuse things I've closed myself off and let her manage them entirely, which slowed the progression but feels like a holding pattern more than anything.  The only time things get close to normal is when they leave for the summer and about a week before they return we are at easy enjoying each others company.

Financially I've had to remove all access for her from our joint account and my accounts, as she was spending beyond our means.  Obliviously this causes lots of bickering and her openly complaining to anyone who will listen that we don't have enough money and that I'm not helping her out, but never saying anything about the EX that rarely pays child support.  But will complain that I'm paying my EX too much in CS.  I've been keeping us afloat but just barely so this has taken it's toll on me as well.

Our relationship is good when it gets a chance to be that way.  We both work full time me (60-70) her (40) and because of my job I've had to cancel plans we made on several occasions but always tried to make up for it later but this is constantly thrown in my face.  Any misstep I've made is always thrown in my face I'm not allowed to defend myself.  I really do care for her, but the stress and strife is just draining me so much so that talking with friends and trying to just recharge my emotional battery I've run into someone who I've started to develop feelings for.  I'm not one to cheat and I've forgiven her for cheating (in the first 6 months of marriage) but cheating is cheating whether physical or emotional and I've been trying to resist this but I'm feeling like that divorce and starting over would be a far better option.

I care alot for her and her kids and it frightens me what might happen to them if I'm gone not watching over things but I don't know if I can/should continue this on.

885,369tif,"Me [19f] and my bf [19m]  Have been in a long distance relationship the past school year and in a relationship about a year. We got to visit each other a lot so it wasnt to bad. He treated me well, always was loving, told be he loved me ect, did wonderful things for me, and we communicated splendidly. But all of a sudden, a little over a month ago after his spring break, there was this weird switch on his end.

 He just suddenly stopped being affectionate, started parting more, and in general had less time for me. He had not been feeling well on the eve of Christmas break. Kept saying how much he missed me, how much he needed me. Come right around after spring break then, he went colder...  He waited to saying anything about it till he got back in person a day ago. He said that he just suddenly lost interest and didnt know why but  thought the best thing to do was break up. He said he didn't meet anyone else, and didnt know why hes feeling this way.  He left after a long exhausting sob-conversation, both of us confused and crying. He ended up texring me later saying  that he didnt know if that was the right decision to break up, but he did think that we are on different stages of the relationship. 

So i called him asking him to elaborate and the more he talked the more he kept saying he just been feeling lately like hes lost and confused about everything.  We ended up deciding to not call it a break up, but a break for now and be open to the possibilities.. He said that he thinks he needs him-time to try to i guess collect himself a little, and deep down i think that would be good for me to. But I feel so scared. I don't understand whats going on or how his feelings for me could suddenly change, or just whats going on with him in general.

525,24silq,"My boyfriend and I have been living together for about a year. We aren't hurting to make ends meet, but it seems like we're always living paycheck to paycheck in spite of the fact that our expenses are probably about half of what we take home. My boyfriend makes twice as much money as I do, and therefore pays the rent note while I'm responsible for all the other bills (electric, gas, water, cable/internet, groceries, and savings). We each have our own cell phone and car insurance bills that we take care of on our own, and they add up to about the same amount for each of us. 

All of his bills come around the same time each month and he's always dipping into the savings I pay toward to help him with his part of the bills. I don't mind helping him out, but this is becoming an issue because I'd like for us to be able to go on vacations, or to be able to afford to get new furniture when we need it, or to even just have money for emergencies. He, however, always seems to need me to pay part of his bills, which drains anything I can save. After my bills, and everything, I'm usually only able to save about $200-$400 each month while still living comfortably. This isn't so bad, in my opinion, but now savings is down to $100 again because he needed money again. This happens just about every month. 

I try to cut back on the amount of activities we go out and spend money on, but this just prompts him to spend money on other things. He's very adamant about keeping our finances separate, so I don't think me managing his portion of income is going to be an option. Does anyone have any suggestions as to what I can do to prevent him from draining savings? I'm at a loss.

First let me be clear that I have nothing against peoples personal belief. I personally think that belief is a personal matter and that every individual can decide for themselves if they want to believe in a personal God. I personally don't believe in a God and would not have any trouble at all with a believing girlfriend.

However, earlier tonight my girlfriend called me and asked me out of the blue if I believe in God. Now I know that my girlfriend was raised with Christian morals and values, as was I, but she and her family never went to church or being commited to their faith.

As I told her on the phone that I'm not a religious person, she started crying. Asking me what the reason is we are living for, and if I don't have a sense of some greater belonging. She went on explaining that she has felt miserable for some time until she saw a show on TLC about a very religious family, and they were having a great time together. She said that she had a sense of something bigger now and that it felt great.

Now I would not have an issue with my girlfriend being religious, if it were'nt for the severe reaction I got when i told that I am not religious and probably won't be.

It also hurt to hear that she has been feeling miserable for some time. I also asked her if she thinks that me being not religious could affect our relation in a serious way, she told me 'I don't know'. This leaves me with a sick feeling, that something so sudden can affect our relation.

She ended the phone call by asking if I could watch this movie she saw on youtube, #FallingPlates.
To be honest, this only feels like salt to the wounds, giving me a feeling that she needs the love of Jesus, while I should be the one making her happy.

705,3cbze1,"Hi all me and my ex broke up about two weeks ago when we were on vacation meeting her dad. Our relationship started off as a long distance, me in Chicago and her in California. I decided to move out to live with her in Cali In oct2014. We have been together for almost a 1.5 years. We played games together and she left me for a guy I knew and played for 3 years in WoW. I guess I can start off by stating what I think I did wrong. I am a pretty mellow guy and she is a high maintenance girl. She wants to feel secured about the relationship, wants to feel loved, and wants attention a lot. I couldn't keep up with what she asked for (small gifts, flowers, or love noted). I would definitely get her things on special occasion like holidays or birthdays but I've tried to do things for her on normal days but I've stopped cuz when I see something I want to give her I always get the thought she would hate it so I don't do anything about it. 

Well we played WoW and what I thought was my best friend swapped numbers. Her, him, and me so we can keep in touch if he needed anything. Fast forward later they text quite often but I think nothing of it cuz I had trust in both of them. There are times where I asked if she wanted to play something else but once she told me she rather play with the other guy cuz it's more fun with him and that hurts me. Then there were signs of her turning off her phone when I get close when she is texting him or she angles her phone away from me when we are out. Then a couple days before the vacation to see her dad I caught a text from him and she put a little heart next to his name and told her what's up with that. She just said it's a Purple Heart, just friendly. Then I told her I don't care what the heart means, she has told me she talks to him about our relationship, I just didn't know if it was good or not then. (It was all bad I found out later)   Then I clammed up and I couldn't talk to her throughout the vacation even though she asked if I was fine, I just swallowed my pride and said I'm fine and went through the vacation without talking about it. 

Then we went out during the vacation and I catch her texting him some more, hiding it away from me but I can still catch some texts. I've seen her sending all these heart emotes and others like she has done for me and that's when I blew up. I tried to talk to a friend but she found out and asked me what was that all about and just straight out told her it's about him and her and that's when she told me they started to grow feelings for one another. He had some issues going on with his family and she was there for him and I wasn't doing the things that showed I loved her or show her I appreciated her so he was there for her. We had an argument when we got home and she wanted to see me fight for her. One, she's the kind of girl that doesn't go out so much so there's no other man that I can see that can threaten our relationship and two, the things she was doing with this guy was behind my back so I didn't know until it was too late. I still had about a day or two left in the vacation and it was hellish for me. I felt like I was having an anxiety attack every time I think of her or see her talk to him so I turned to my friends and family to talk to help me calm down. 

Then we went home and i was just quiet and went back home and let her know and her mother know that I was moving out to my cousins after work the next day. She cried and I told her if she wanted to say anything and she just said no. Then the next day came after work and I'm packing my things and she's just sitting around. I was trying to talk to her but she was quiet. Said this sucked and she didn't want this to happen and I told her she made her choice already. She loved the other guy and already chose to be with him. She cried when I was about to leave. I hugged her and said my goodbyes and she said it was unfair. I just left and wait outside for my cousin. 

So now two weeks later I had to quit my job cuz I had no means of transportation to work. I'm looking for a job and cutting ties to her slowly. She took me off her freind's list of WoW along with the guy she's with. Both took me off their friends list on the Fourth of July and I'm so confused on why. I kept them there for a chance to be friends again if any. But vowed to stopped playing WoW until I get my life back on track. I'm just confused on why this happened. What did I do wrong for her to leave me and for someone I trusted and called my best friend to take her away from me. I'm getting better through the days but that's always in my head. Sorry for the wall of text but I try not to leave anything wrong cuz she posted a picture saying on Facebook before I took her off she doesn't care if I tell everyone, just make sure to tell them what I've done to her but I don't know what I've done to have her emotionally cheat on me with another guy.

Now I'm all for guarding the house and what not, and keeping it in all the public places in the house (living room and kitchen). But I think that it's going to far when my parents decided to install one in my bedroom, under the guise of it's for your own safety. 

I'm not a bad kid, I do my homework, try to play nice, attend and participate in my parents religion. I've given them no reason not to trust me. So when they installed these cameras, I felt it was a huge violation of my privacy. I like my privacy, being alone in the house, naked in my room, etc. I have body issues, so I'm not to keen on having somebody be able to watch me change clothes, stroll naked, hang out in my underwear, or anything like that. 

But now I can't do that. I live in fear of being watched 24/7, and I can't be comfortable in my own home. It's terrible (I know, it's a first world problem). And frankly, as a hormonal teenager, I also enjoy masturbating, and experimenting alone. I can't even do THAT in my own room! 

So I recently decided to move the camera behind the TV today so I can't be watched. Dad got pissed and mom did to. They say that it's there house so they can do what they want. I get that it's their house, but does that mean I get no privacy?

My parents get home at 6 pm EST today, so I have from now to then to defend how I feel about it. Can anybody help me? How can I show them that's it's wrong to have one in my private space? Do I get a right to privacy? Even in the home they pay for? Are there any laws preventing this in NY state? 

Anything would help, honestly. Thanks for reading :)!

I met this fantastic girl a 3 months ago and we where talking every day since that day. About a month ago we started dating and there was affection from both sides and we decided to start a relationship.

Everything went great in the past month, we had alot of fun: Watching movies, going cinemas, diners, we even went to IKEA and she was all like I want that when we ever gonna live together.

We started to get really close, kissing all the time, holding hands etc. We had sex several times and it was fantastic for both, she told me i was the best she ever had.

But last night she couldn't get turned on, she did give me a blowjob (dindt ask for it) because she said she liked to do it. When i started to get down on her i saw that her body was not accepting anything and that her vagina was.. how i say it... defence mode, very tight and the clit was hard to reach. She asked me to stop because she was feeling dizzy and so we did.

The next morning she woke up crying and i asked her whats wrong, she cried in my arms for about 20minutes telling me thats she couldn't say it because it would hurt me. She told me i was the first to know and told me I'm gay and that she can't get turned on by men.

We had intercourse several times and she told me she enjoyed it, she did moan alot (not sure if fake). Altho after lets say 2minutes it would start to hurt her and i would pull out if i dind't came, i respected her.

Ill try to keep this brief. Last year my girlfriend mentioned, while buzzed, that she would want another girl in the bedroom with us. Not for me though. So she can experience a girl going down on her. I joked how I would be involved and she said maybe there would be some rules involving, well, involvement. Months later, she makes the same comment and reminded me she brought it up before and is still interested. The question is.... How do I go about this situation? She would never confront another girl to be involved. Should I? Is this some sort of test? She doesn't normally do these things, but she is a great time in the bedroom.

I think shes serious and I want to make this happen for her without anyone being uncomfortable. Help? Haha.

893,3h595f,"Hi all,

 I actually browse this sub pretty frequently but I'm using an alt because my bf knows my regular account.

 Recently, my boyfriend and I moved from the midwest out here to Las Vegas, where I'm going to be starting grad school.  I was offered a fairly well-paying job in my field before we moved, so we knew we'd at least have some income. He got offered a job within a couple weeks of being here, it was only paying minimum wage and working at an inventory company (so pretty boring) but he was making enough to pay for his cigarettes and his half of the groceries, which was nice because our bills are higher out here than we were used to back home.  His plan was to look for a job within his field (he's a welder) and work this little part time job temporarily.

 After a few weeks at his job, however, he started to really hate it. I've worked retail jobs before, I know how awful they can be, but I've always done whatever I had to to pay the bills. Then he told me he was thinking about quitting.  He was only making about $100 per week, but it was at least something. At the time, I wasn't out of training yet so I wasn't making my fulltime hours and we needed every dollar we could get. I expressed my concerns about the financial aspect and ultimately left the decision up to him. He decided to quit so he could focus on his job search, and sure enough we started running into money problems a couple weeks later. I began donating plasma for grocery money, but he wasn't able to donate because his veins were too small (or something).  

 Since this happened, things have only gotten worse. He's looking for a job in his field, but he doesn't seem to be looking very hard. He's become completely distant. He sits at home all day playing videogames and eating while I work 10+ hours and then go donate plasma afterward 2x per week. When I get home I usually have to spend about an hour cleaning because he just leaves dishes/trash out where they lie, and our dogs will get into them if I don't do something.  His sleep patterns have become bizarre, he sleeps once every 2 days for 15+ hour stretches. Very rarely will he even come to bed with me, opting instead to play videogames until he passes out on the couch sometime in the wee hours of the morning (if at all).  In addition to all this, his personal hygiene has become almost nonexistent.  As of today he hasn't showered in a week, and he wore the same outfit for the past 5 days (sleeping in it too). He smokes about a pack of cigarettes per day, refusing to listen when I ask him to please go slowly and limit his cigarettes to maybe a pack every other day. When I can't afford to buy him another pack he gets irritable and lashes out at me. 

 I am a mental health professional, and going to school (ironically) to become a marriage and family therapy, which makes this incredibly embarrassing to post, but I really have no idea how to proceed. I know that his behaviors are a sign of depression, and he does have a history of depression. I have asked him on several occasions if he is happy, if he needs to speak to a counselor, if he would like me to send him home for a short period of time (or a long one), but he says he's fine and doesn't need any help.  He claims I do not listen to him, and I think to an extent that's true. I have been making an effort to listen to him more, but he will not extend the same courtesy  to me. He ignores me when I ask him to do chores, etc. Whenever I broach the subject of his job search, he gets defensive and doesn't want to discuss it with me. Today I asked him if we could talk and he said (direct quote): If it's about a job, whether or not I'm happy, or anything about us, I don't want to discuss it. I admit that I did get upset after he said this, and I told him I was tired of being the only person working and the only person cleaning in the house. After I calmed myself down a little, I told him I'd be there when he was ready to talk. I've tried to approach him several times to talk to him about other subjects throughout the day but he has been pretending to be asleep and ignoring me all day.

 I can feel myself beginning to resent him. We have lived together for the past 2 years and he has always, always worked and paid his half of the bills.  I simply don't make enough to support the both of us, and I am beginning to feel more like a mother to him than a significant other. I do love him, I do really hope that this can work out, but I'm starting to doubt if it can.

 I don't really know anyone here well enough to talk to them about this, my friends and family are all states away, and I feel so utterly alone and at a loss. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

905,2lb4eu,"My parents split up before I was born. I never met my biological father, and all I've ever known about him is his name, that he's Irish and that he was a 'bastard who didn't want me'. Growing up I was never really curious about him - I'd never met him so I didn't have anyone to miss. Plus my mother married shortly after I was born, and although her and my stepdad split a few years ago, I have and always will think of him as my dad, so I'd never cared about meeting/knowing about my biological dad.

I didn't have a particularly happy upbringing. My parents struggled a lot with money and constantly fought, and my mother was an alcoholic when I was ages 11-16. She's since got sober, but life seemed unbearable then, and it eventually led to her and my dad divorcing, before she finally hit rock bottom and got sober.

A few weeks ago I turned 18 and received my baby bonds to cash in. My baby bonds were worth £1,200, so I decided it would be a good idea to put them into my savings account and let it build interest. I have my normal bank account which I get paid into and have used for everything since I opened it at 13.

 My savings account is with a building society, and my mum opened it when I was born. My building society only has one branch in our region, and it's in the city (we live a town about 45 minutes away). Obviously when I was a kid my mum put cheques into my account for me, and when I got older she continued to do it because she worked in the city.


I have never looked at my savings account. Like I said, it was in the city, I only ever put in a £20 cheque in from an aunt each year, and I wasn't planning on using the money any time soon - I guessed there was maybe £3,000 in there tops. Anyway, yesterday I was off work and heading into the city, so I thought I'd put my cheque into my building society while I was there. My mum's on holiday at the moment, so I had to spend some time looking for the savings account book and eventually found it in the important documents box.


Obviously I look a look and there's over £100,000 in there. £100,000!


The savings book basically looks like a passport, and each page has three columns; Name - Deposit/withdrawl type (cash/cheque) - amount and at the bottom of the page there's a balance. I can see from the day I was born my biological father has deposited a lot of money into my account regularly, and paid larger sums on birthdays/Christmas/Easter in cash. The most recent was on my 18th.


I have SO many questions and my mum isn't back until Friday, which is probably for the best because I need to think! Where the hell do I go from here? Why did my mum never tell me, she must have seen how much he was putting in each time she deposited a cheque for me! Why has he never tried to meet me before or even see how I'm doing? He remembered my birhtday and Christmases so he must have cared. I have NO IDEA how to contact him, who he is, what he's like or if I even want to. What the hell do i do with all this money? What would my life have been like if I'd grown up with him instead of my alcoholic mother?

The main issue is my mum never telling me! She's obviously known about this my entire life. She has let me believe my bio dad never cared about me or wanted to meet me my entire life and never said anything. Now I'm thinking she's probably known where he is all along and kept me from him or something! I'm so lost.

So I met this girl - lets call her Stacy - on Tinder (don't even start) and we seemed to hit it off pretty well. For the first bit we would be texting constantly, then we finally met and everything seemed to be going really well. In total we hung out 5 different times and it was all great. We got past the first kiss and by the end of the last couple times we had hung out, we'd kiss goodbye.

Then I noticed Stacy wasn't texting as much. At first it seemed normal so I kind of left it. Then I really started to notice problems. I would try to set something up with Stacy and she would agree and seemed really excited, until the last minute when she would forget that she had something else and would blow me off. So far this has happened 2 times.

There was also a case in which we both had the day off and I had mentioned that I would like to see her, but she was AFK all day and nothing happened. Then the next day I got a message saying I'm such an ass, I forgot you had the day off and we could have hung out

So finally I decided to confront her about this because I was just getting way to frustrated and don't have the patience for much more BS. This is when she told me that she has commitment issues and that she wasn't expecting things to go so smoothly. She said when this happened she got weird and kind of pushed me away. She is aware that it is 100% her and has told me it's not me being to forward or anything, but it's still frustrating. She also told me that in the past she had a bad experience with someone when she let them get close.

I had pretty much decided to end things or at least give us space, but I don't want that to happen so right now we are just texting and talking, but no further plans to hangout, but frankly I don't like that and see the point in it.

I know that my girlfriend has a very bad image of herself and that's mostly the cause of all of this. How do I know that? I will explain. A few years ago we both took an oath to get in shape. She dropped 20+ pounds and I dropped 40. We were both in the best shape we had ever been in and she would obviously wear tighter fighting clothing and just carry herself much more proudly. 

After hitting it hard for about 4 or 5 months, she broke down one day and said she didn't want to do it (work out/eat right) anymore. I literally started laughing and I told her that she can do whatever she wants to do and I'll love her regardless. The thought that she was doing it because she thought I wanted her to was crazy. I stressed that I didn't care and that I wanted her to be happy &amp; healthy. 

Over the course of the past few years since then she's put on 20 or so pounds and I don't care. I just want her to be happy and I'm attracted to her still so it didn't bother me.

Finally, yesterday I brought it up and told her that although it's not something that I am comfortable doing 100% of the time. I explained that it makes me feel like she is not into it and even if that is not true, it causes me to be less into it and then causes the sex to be less than stellar for both of us. 

She agreed and apologized. I made sure to tell her that she has nothing to be sorry for and that we can work to fix whatever it is. I asked if its her image of herself that causes her not to feel sexy and she said yes. We kinda ended there but I want to make sure that I can be there for her during this time because I'm sure she feels like shit.

Background: She had an awful, awful life before she met my father in her 30's. They met in Al-Anon (support for family members of alcoholics) She was abused as a child, had an alcoholic and gambling addict father, was kicked out of the house at 16 by her alcoholic stepfather. Then she was engaged to an alcoholic that physically abused her, he cheated on her a few days before their wedding and she left. She then met my father in Al-anon. No major issues with my Dad, they're still married. 

How this relates to me: She does not trust anyone. Everyone has hidden motives (insidious is a word she uses a lot.) Any negative trait someone has becomes their whole persona (i.e. she sees someone lie, they are now a liar) She has had this attitude with both platonic friends (even my girlfriends) and my significant others. Also with her own friends, and my sisters relationships. 

I've been dating my SO [22M] for 5 years. One of the main sources of drama in our relationship is my mother. She will love him one minute and then text me a page long rant about how he is a liar and manipulative and playing the victim. These are completely out of the blue and usually take out of context things that I told her (usually positive things that she ruminates into something bad) She also sends emotionally aggressive text messages to my SO and just sent some to his mother (why I am posting)

There is definitely some mental illness that plays into it. We both have very obsessive-compulsive traits (she has a hoarding problem and I have seen therapists for OCD) I think she is ruminating the things that she sees in my relationship into patterns that she saw in the abusive ones. 

We get along fantastic when she is stable, she is one of my closest friends and I don't want to cut her out. We have so much fun together, we are both adventurous and fly by the seat of our pants. 

SO is worried about our future (boundaries with children, fighting with in-laws etc.) I want my mother in my life but she is impossible to deal with sometimes.

61,2o53d9,"Long story short, we have been dating around 18 months. The sex has entirely dried up because her depression has resurfaced.

About 8 months ago she first told me she suffered from Depression. This was something brought upon by bullying all through her childhood and later school life. Apparently she had been in a very bad place until by chance we met, and I asked her out and she felt her life turned a huge corner.

About 10 months into the relationship, we hit a bad patch. I was changing job, changing homes, and to top it off was misdiagnosed with a serious medical condition which thankfully turned out to be fine 3 months later. During this time, I was on medication, and the sex suffered. I didnt want sex at all, and would often find it hard to keep an erection when we did. She took it very personally, that I no longer found her attractive, or that I was cheating, or I just didnt care anymore.

We worked past it all, but it seemed to have been a contributing factor in her depression re-surfacing. It took about 3 months for her to admit to herself and us all she needed to go back to talk to somebody which she has been working on. She had one or two pretty big breakdowns after nights out drinking which brought on this realisation.

Since about 6 months ago, we have probably had sex 2 or 3 times. If you can even call it that. Only full penetration once, and the other times was basically attempted foreplay on my behalf. She seems to have a hard time even considering herself in a sexual way, and is afraid of sex, despite the last time we fooled around she orgasmed multiple times and it really seemed to completely change her for the positive for 2 or 3 days.

Ive tried talking to her about it, and she knows she needs and wants to make a consciouss decision to become more intimate, but most times I try to instigate she panics and worries. Ive noticed its only when we are out drinking together that she looses her inhibitions and would often sexually try and instigate with myself.

Ive tried to suggest we take it in tiny steps, be it spend a night cuddling, then another night let me bite her neck like she loves. Then cuddle with our tops off in bed one night in the dark. Try and work out way up just to naked cuddling with no sexual acts yet.

1219,2ol7yg,"Okay, so starting from the start. I have just come out of a 2year very difficult relationship. Spent the last few months just processing that and embracing life. Wasn't looking for anything, but then randomly met this boy.

He has been with his ex gf for 5years, they had been broken up about two months when we met.

So from the moment we met we've been talking quite a bit and spending quite a bit of time with each other. We decide we both don't want a relationship but let's just see where this goes. 
That's fine by me.

During this time he's just amazing, we connect so well, we get along so well. We talk about everything and for the first time for both of us the relationship/friendship is just easy!

Naturally I begin to fall for him, and I feel he does for me too. Just the way he acts, the way he cares, the way he goes out of his way to make me happy.
So we have a few of 'where is this going' talks, we both almost walk away because we feel that's the best thing to do when he's unsure of what he wants.

We stay together .. Although I know how he's feeling and I am trying everything to give him what he needs to be happy. I tried to give him space, told him not to talk to me, told him maybe we should stop sleeping with each other he tells me that isn't what he wants. I did give him a few days of no contact anyway. After these few days he tells me he can see a future with me and he does like me, it just hasn't been enough time since his last relationship. Which I completely understand. I never stated I wanted a relationship, I just wanted him to know what he wants.

So then this week he goes really funny, doesn't spend much time with me, doesn't really talk to me. I've been a bit female in this week, just one of those weeks where you're just not feeling life and you just have to ride it out. I spoke to him about this during the week and apologized.
Anyway he's still weird and so I offer him to come over so we can talk. 
We talk and he verifies that everything is ok and makes me feel better again. So now we're all peachy.
Now I bring up the fact that I could be moving overseas next year, I am purely talking to him about this to get his perspective and just to talk to someone as i'm confused as all get out. He immediately jumps onto the bandwagon of i'm asking where this is going and having the relationship talk. This conversation goes south very very quickly and things escalate to the point that we have called off seeing each other anymore.

In this conversation he has told me that he doesn't feel the spark with me, this is what I have trouble computing. He's been very hot on me just to turn around and say there's no spark.
It's left me insanely confused and I don't know where to go from here. Do I just walk away and leave it alone or do I try and make a mends and just try being friends?

I [20/m] have been dating my girlfriend since i was a junior in high school, and she [18/f] was a freshman. For a timescale, she graduates this year. The relationship in that time frame was impossibly smooth and we truly enjoy each others company. Spent nearly everyday together and never had any issues whatsoever. The relationship was textbook perfect. So much that it was truly odd.

Due to the length of the relationship and that its impossible for junior military members to live with a significant other unless they are married, we were openly talking about getting married recently so we can be together again. Yet I cant stop this lurking thought that's telling me to not do it.

Earlier this year i enlisted in the military and have been away from home approximately 9 months. Around the 5 month mark i kept noticing a new random male snapchat username popping up on her bestfriends list. I confronted her and she insisted that it was just a friend who was a co-worker. Even though i knew better I let it go.

Later on i still noticed that this username was still at the top of her best friends list, and confronted her. She admitted that she was emotionally involved with this man and that she made plans to see him at a movie theater and made out with him. She then defended herself by saying that the man tried touching her and she: stopped his advances, felt bad, moved away, and stopped talking to him. Upon further questioning she stood by that no provocative pictures were ever sent between them. 

She apologized profusely and i accepted her apology. I believe everyone screws up sometimes, and this is the first time other males has ever been an issue. Besides, it was just kissing, i justified to myself, the important thing is that she stopped it from going farther''. 

Sense then i feel she's been seeking attention from other guys. I continually find new random male usernames popping up on her Snapchat best friends list. Just like before, she insists they are just friends. Of course my spidysenses are going off.

So now I'm at a giant fork in my life. 

Do I ignore my spidysenses saying that she's: too young, not mature enough, and not ready to be loyal with a military man that will be constantly LDR? 

Or take a gamble and forgive the girl that before i joined the military seemed so mature for her age, goodhearted, kind, and had the same goals and values that I have.

584,1i15x5,"Hey everyone, I'm looking for some thoughts/perspectives on my situation.  I have been dating my current girlfriend for over 5 years now. 

About a year and a half ago, I moved 3000 miles away from work.  She stayed behind as she is still in school and has about 8 months left of Grad School as of today.  Over the past few months, I just haven't felt connected to her at all and have been thinking of breaking up with her.  The best way to describe it is that I don't feel like I am in love with her anymore.  She is up here visiting me until Saturday for my birthday.  I was really hoping that when I saw her, I would fall back in love with her and there would be some sort of spark there, but I knew the second I saw her at the airport that I had to end it.  We've been having a good time together and I've enjoyed spending time with her while she has been up here, but I just don't feel romantically attached to her anymore.

She is an amazing girl and I love her to death, but I just don't think I am in love with her anymore.  She is madly in love with me, talks about how she can't wait to move up here with me and start our lives together.  I know I could continue dating her and then have her move up here and be sort of happy, but I know deep down that its the wrong thing to do.  Part of me wants to stick with her because I don't think I'll ever find anyone as nice/stable/sweet, but I'm pretty sure thats just me being jealous and that she deserves someone who feels 100% as crazy about her as she does about me.

So I guess what I'm asking is, how should I break up with her?  Should I do it in person while she is here before she leaves?  Should I wait until after she gets back for a few days and do it over the phone.  I was planning on doing the latter and explaining the above written to her, but the few friends I have asked are split on it.  Also, am I doing the right thing by her by breaking up with her or are these feelings of not wanting to right?

865,2lyn64,"I've recently put myself and someone I care deeply about in a pretty shitty situation. I've known this girl for about a year and over that time I have developed feelings for her. She is incredible. Smart, funny, ambitious, beautiful, I could go on. On the weekend just passed her, myself and a couple of mutual friends had some drinks together, one thing led to another and I foolishly acted on these feelings, only to find out that she too has developed feelings for me.


We didn't have sex. We didn't even kiss. Instead we shared the most beautiful intimacy that I could ever imagine, I've never experienced anything like it in my life. I could live in that moment forever. I went and saw her the following night, where after a prolonged period of the same intimacy I built up the courage to kiss her, I've never felt so much passion running through me. We kissed and explored each other for hours. The same thing happened last night, only this time it was a little more intense, I went down on her, it was beautiful. Afterwards, she tried to return the favor, I declined because it's so much more to me than that.


I seriously think I could spend the rest of my life sharing these moments with this person. But she is engaged. In about a months time she is moving interstate to be with her fiance and to live the life she has planned. To make things even harder than they have to be, I live in a share house, she lives next door.
I feel like I should feel guilty, but I don't. Neither does she. I know she feels for me the way I do her, she wouldn't let herself be in this situation if she didn't. She has told me that she is questioning as to whether she wants to leave. Not only is her fiance already living where she is planning to move, it's where she grew up, everything is there, family, friends, the next step in her career, her life. She believes that there is multiple people that are destined to be with an individual, but timing is the key. I guess that makes sense, but I don't want to spend the rest of my life looking/waiting for something as amazing as this.

I told him that from the start, and he replied hell no. But he insisted we were dating. I ignored it and did my own life. 

Eventually we started getting serious and I moved in with him. He ended up losing his job. He was ok of thr thought of marriage then. I recieved a promotion at work and took care of all the bills and gas. Our agreement was go him to finish college. Well he ended up quitting college and began telling me its for losers. He ended up spending my money without any permission. It was hell. So I moved.

 He randomly would dump me. One time he sent me a pic of him kissing another woman. I seriously dont know why I endured so much from this guy. Maybe it was because I was working so hard and stressed from that, that Indont want to accept what he was doing. I became delusional I guess. The main problem is that he was a virgin before we met. So I tried giving him open heart and forgiveness and taught him the ins and out. Well. This yr I moved away. 

The plan was for him to get ready for something serious and for me to finish college that way finance wouldn't be an issue. Well he dumped me randomly saying we are too different. That was a real earth shattering blow. Im thankful he did that because it woke me up from the delusion. He then assumed we were dating again. I thought ok.. ill play along, maybe something good will come out of it. 

I went to visit him a few days ago. We had sex and I ended up crying so hard. I couldnt stop. Well later I started asking him what he wants for the future. And he ended up giving me a huge lecture about how im too old to find a good man because i have no more beauty, and that his friends are more important and doesnt want any marriage from any woman. Ok I respect that. Thats his wishes not mine.

 So I dumped him. He then blew up my phone about how he doesnt understand why I cant be delusional enough to assume we are married. And how he'd never marry a woman who would hold a relationship hostage over something so tedious. Again, not my problem anymore. I gave him a chance.

I’ve talked about this guy in a previous post – we went out 5 times in 4 weeks and really hit it off. We did have sex on date 4, and also date 5. Since the day after date 5 (which he came back from his beach house to see me), we have been in touch daily, nothing super constant but at least a few texts back and forth each day. This was last Monday. Since then, he has been at his beach house with his family (he is currently not working, starts in September). Wednesday we were in pretty stable touch, with him initiating conversations and asking questions, I got a big promotion that day so he told me how happy he was for me, was asking what I was going to do to celebrate, etc etc. Thursday and yesterday he was a bit quieter but I didn’t think much of it, he is busy with family and activities and basically being on a very long vacation.


Last night he texted me Happy Friday! in response to something I said (in response to his response) and asked me what I was doing this weekend at 6pm last night. I responded about 6 hours later after I got home around midnight because I was out last night and I try not to focus on my phone while I’m with friends. I told him my plan and asked what he was doing.


Now it is almost 12pm on Sunday and no response. I’m really confused/upset. I know it is totally possible he has been busy with family and not on his phone, but of course I jump to “he’s gone forever” mode. This is the longest he’s gone without replying.


However, I don’t think he would have bothered staying in touch while away with family til now only to ghost after ASKING ME A QUESTION. Right?

108,2u2uzq,"**I'm not great at typing posts like these, so I may forget things or keep them unintentionally vague. Feel free to ask for clarification if needed.**

My boyfriend and I have been together for around 10 months now. We met on OkCupid, started dating and that escalated into a full-blown relationship. It's been a great relationship so far and I love to be with him. I'm incredibly comfortable and relaxed when I'm with him and generally am able to show emotions in front of him (crying when watching movies for an example).

However, it is much more difficult to open up about some of my more personal problems and I have a bad tendency to hide these. To put on a mask. At the start of our relationship I was in a relatively good spot and thought I could deal with my issues, but instead it snowballed out of control and I am worse off than where I started. The guilt is slowly becoming too much for me and I realize I owe it to my boyfriend to open up about it.

These are my issues:

I'm having big issues with my motivation for my study Psychology for around 2 years now. My first year went great and I passed all my courses, but my motivation and self-esteem dropped in my second year due to which I failed a few classes. My third year I even failed more than half of them, most even due to not meeting the attendance requirements. This is something that's not normal for me and for which I am deeply ashamed. I can't seem to get out of this downward spiral of trying to motivate myself and dropping down deeper again due to failing at it. I also don't know where these issues came from, since everything was going decently.

I'm currently in my 'fourth year' in which I should have followed the courses that I failed. I had to apply for them in the summer. When I met my boyfriend, I was convinced I could easily manage this. But evidently I didn't...

So to sum it up:

**1) I had to apply in the summer for my courses and I didn't meet the deadline.** I did not try to correct my mistake after that and missed one of the courses already in the first period (August). This is where I realized that something is wrong again. I have always been someone who was good at postphoning things, but I never failed to do them.

**2) I gave my BF the impression that I would be following Statistics from February onwards.** This is where I am 100% in the wrong. Instead of telling my BF that I had issues and did not apply for my courses, I decided to hide it and give him the impression that my courses didn't start until February. This is the same lie I'm telling other friends and family in order to keep up the charade that I'm fine and nothing is wrong. So far nobody seems to suspect a thing. The only one who knows about the surface of my problems is a friend of mine, although I see her little nowadays.

**3) It's even worse because my SO is talking about living together after I finish my study** (which should be in 1,5 years, but is now already a minimum of 2,5 years). He lives around an hour from me and is the only one with a driver's license. He's driving a lot to see me each week. I feel so bad for stringing him along in my issues and realize I need to be honest with him.

**4) Another bad point is that I know my BF does not like lying and he has been hurt that way by an ex before.** Once he told me that I should've opened up about myself, but I didn't. I'm afraid that me telling him all of this will utterly devestate him, although I realize that hiding it even further isn't an option either.

So my question essentially is:

**How can I tell him all of this while hurting him as little as possible?**

The brother is in an abusive relationship with his girlfriend who is the same age. I guess we, my husband and I can't agree on the best course of action.

The pair have been together for three years and the brother has tried to break up with the girl multiple times, but she will say that she is going to kill herself or make him kill her. She has pushed him down the stairs, stabbed him with keys, bit him until he bled, punched him, screams, and throws things at him. All this happens at the girls parents. I tried to talk with her parents about it, but they think it's harmless because she only weighs 110 pounds and he's just being a pussy and he can leave whenever.

They also let him borrow their car so the brother has told his own mom that he feels obligated to stay with her and to marry the girl.

My husband wants to forcibly split them up, but I feel like that would make matters worse. He thinks I'm taking the girls side when I'm trying to make sure that hopefully the brother will see a way out with either his mom or with us.

We got along so well that we could complete each other's sentence and we were so happy together, he was very devoted too. Then somewhere along the way and his obsession with fame and success in his career (entertainment industry), he started to care less and less about me. He didn't come see me as often and wouldn't let me go see him when i wanted to.

He went on with his life as normal, happy with work, surrounded by pretty girls and cameras. I wasn't fine. I was sad and i missed him so much. We talked a few times but it just made it worst because i knew he didn't care about me or wanted me back anymore.

891,2yagw0,"We're in grad school and we've been pretty close friends up til now - trial by fire in a closed universe of peers and whatnot. I just found out he's regularly sleeping with another classmate despite having a long-term girlfriend living 3 hours away. 

This bugs the shit out of me for a few reasons:

1) Cheating is nasty, demeaning business. I have been cheated on, and have cheated many moons ago. Two of my closest friends' marriages have imploded from infidelity. It cheapens everyone involved and I have so little respect for those who unrepentantly carry on affairs. My opinion of my friend has greatly diminished since I found out. 

2) He admitted to me a few weeks back that they'd hooked up once in a moment of weakness and said it wasn't going to happen again, full stop. Fine: I'm not going to demand moral purity from anyone and didn't condemn him then. 

Yet he was clearly lying in his mea culpa to me (which was unprompted, initiated by him and sprung unexpectedly on me, even though I'd suspected). He shows zero intention on cutting things off with the new girl or breaking up with the old. That's not cool. He's lying to his girlfriend and lying to me - is this someone I even want to be friends with? 

3) I'm married and don't know if I want to disclose to my husband what I know. There's nothing remotely romantic between my friend and I, but there's a certain impropriety of a married woman hanging out with an open and notorious cheater. I'm certain my husband would want me to stop being such close friends with him if he knew. 

I need to tell my husband, right? I want to be mindful of his wishes if he'd prefer that we not be so close, and I don't like hiding things from him. At the same time, it's impossible to get that genie back in the bottle once it's out. I've been ducking the issue by staying quiet while avoiding my friend. 

4) Also, the other woman sucks. She's a not-terribly-fun-or-clever spoiled rich girl who plays up the naive card and doesn't act like the grown-ass woman she ought to be. (Besides, the innocent act loses steam if you're moving in on someone else's partner.) If maintaining our friendship means spending more time with her, I'd rather not. 

So what are my options here? Do I confront my friend (and what good will that accomplish, anyway? Surely he knows what he's doing is wrong.) Is there a gauntlet or ultimatum that must be laid down?

Do I just slowly distance myself and stop eating lunch together every day, stop going out for drinks after class, stop hanging out at his house with our clique, stop inviting him over? Do I owe him any explanation?

Or should I just get over it and accept that it really and truly is none of my business and not my place to judge? How to handle our friendship going forward, though?

898,35nz2e,"I dated 'Dan' for 6ish months, then we broke it off because he didn't want a relationship. I was annoyed because he had cheated on me, worn down my self esteem, and lied a great deal to me. Most of all I was annoyed at myself for putting up with it. During those 6 months I was part of Dan's friendship circle and had befriended his friends, including a guy called Alex. 

I vow not to see Dan again. I continue hanging out with Alex, but now it's one on one. We click very well, we like the same music, we go to gigs together and get drunk frequently. We sleep together once but mess around a lot, each time agreeing we shouldn't (because he is still friends with Dan), but there is a strong chemistry.
After a month, Alex meets a 18 year old Spanish girl who is absolutely besotted with him and very attractive. He pulls away from me. I'm honestly not too fazed as I knew nothing could happen anyway. I think she's cute and fun to hang out with, if a bit young. 

 Anyway, so I'm into spoken word poetry. Mostly as a means to practice my public speaking as the audiences are very supportive and I've always liked poetry. 
I decide to perform for the first time (one of my goals). Of course, my friends come to support, Dan and Alex included. 

The poem is about a mixture of people - not one person at all. It is fictional, but told in first person, it sounds as if it's a direct confession. One of the verses talks about watching arms crawling up a neck like poison ivy, jealousy, etc. 
Alex evidently thinks it is about him, when it isn't. I saw his face after I had performed. We're not hanging out at all now, and it seems a shame. Whenever we hang out in a group it's unpleasant. Should I confront him and tell him it wasn't about him? That it was just an expression of lots of different feelings I've had at different periods of my life?

1121,1kocj7,"I love my boyfriend a lot and as a whole I believe our relationship is very happy and healthy. Nonetheless, sometimes I feel frustrated or neglected because things can feel very one sided.

When we started dating, he told me some of his girlfriends had broken up with him because they felt like he didn't care about them. He told me he couldn't understand what he did wrong. At first I felt like he maybe didn't like me that much but as we continued to date I realized he is just more reserved about expressing his affections. Most of the time this is fine. I know he loves me. But lately, especially since we have moved in together (a month ago), I feel neglected. I feel like I'm initiating a lot of the affection in our relationship and I feel guilty when I ask him if we are ok because he doesn't seem to understand.

I asked him if today we could hang out together. He said yeah but he has to go into work for an indefinite period to get something fixed on his computer (it's his second day off work this week). I told him I feel like we don't do a lot together besides sitting on the couch and he got confused and said well we went out for A's birthday two nights ago. I said no, I mean alone. He said ok but seemed kind of confused. He also says he doesn't want to spend money or go anywhere -- which is fine in the end. I guess I just want a little of his attention? A lot of the time we spend together is either with our friends, or with us sitting on the couch after work and not talking much (he usually gets off work at 8pm and is tired -- otherwise we go out). 

I love him more than anything. All of major things in our relationship are fine and compatible but I don't know how to communicate to him that the lack of affection sometimes makes me feel neglected. Our friends always joke about how whenever we go out together, he spends half the time talking to them about me and how he loves me and how I'm awesome. This makes me happy, but why can't he tell me that too? 

The last time he was truly truly affectionate with me and verbalized how he felt was when we were drunk on my birthday 3 months ago. I don't want it to be that he can only talk to me like that when drunk.

185,2mhi9e,"My mom has been in a long-distance relationship with her boyfriend (my stepdad) for about eight years now. Even with the distance and some of his financial issues, they used to have a very strong relationship. And us kids love him to death.

Anyways, my mom dropped a bombshell on me a few days ago: That he's thinking about breaking up with her and had been for 6 months. She had no idea. He didn't go into much detail about why, but we think it's a combination of a mid-life crisis and him realizing that, at 43, all the dreams he was absolutely convinced would happen aren't happening. Needless to say, my mom is destroyed over it - this was the man she wanted to marry and loves deeply.

I was talking to her earlier today and she mentioned something about his politics. And it kind of hit us that this might be the biggest problem here.

He has always been a VERY staunch libertarian. Nothing wrong with that, but my mom and I have noticed that he has become a lot more extreme over the past year or two. And he's not only become more extreme in his political views, but he has become a big conspiracy theorist too. New World Order, Agenda 21, 9/11 being an inside job, global warming is a hoax, the Muslims are taking over Europe and America. And, of course, the communists are taking over and they're indoctrinating our kids.

He sees the left in everything. An innocuous comment like Wow, gas is expensive'' will launch him into a political rant. One time, my mom went to pick my sister up after picking up my stepdad from the airport. They go into the school, and he sees a mural the kids made that had a Walt Disney quote about teamwork and working together. He turns to my mom in disgust and says [paraphrased], See how they're teaching your kids Marxism already? 

My mom told me to *please* not talk about politics with him, and I didn't know why until recently. Apparently, after any debates we had, he would go to my mom and angrily complain about how I don't know anything because ''I'm always on the computer'', and that it is my mom and dad's responsibility to keep me from being indoctrinated. My mom was like No, I'm not going to tell my daughter what to believe and would shut any further complaints down with that.

Speaking of kids, his poor kids are always forced to sit through these long political rants. The older one is parroting the stuff he says, too. My stepdad's own mother confronted him and said he was basically brainwashing them, but he doesn't listen to her because she's a liberal and thus ''lives in la la land''. 

Today my mom told me something I had no idea about before, and she said it was because she was so embarrassed. Last year, he wanted to finish college to be a good example to his kids. He enrolled in a university and did really well, and he had only two classes left to graduate ... and then he dropped out. My mom was absolutely stunned and asked why.

He said it was because he had spoken with the professor and he thought she was a communist, and that the whole university was made up of communists, and he was going to ''stand up for his principles''. No, I'm not kidding. He quit college with two classes left to graduate because apparently the university is indoctrinating people into communism.

And yes he still has to pay back those student loans and is now in more debt than before as a result. BTW, he's over 40K in debt. So much for ''fiscal responsibility''.

I really don't know what to do. His political views are destroying their relationship and he has become so obsessed it's almost all he talks about. I love my stepdad and I don't want to lose him - not only would my mom and I be crushed, but my brother and sister adore him and they would just be completely heartbroken. He's a second father figure to us; he's been in my sister's life since she was only 2 years old. 

What can we do? My mom and I don't care if he's libertarian, we just want him to just ... not be so extreme/obsessed and let it control his life. To just lay off the politics a bit and enjoy life. I don't think he sees that it's hurting his relationship with his family.

What do we do?

So, I'm 19[m] and I haven't been living at home for over a year now. I have a job that allows me to pay rent and live on my own with a few roommates, so I don't visit home often. (Usually once every few months).

My mother has never been a homely person. She's very business oriented, and she wasn't home much. Now she has her office in her home, but she seems to never leave it. She never cooked or cleaned (mostly because she wasn't around) so my older sister and I had to fend for ourselves usually.

This involved me getting a job when I was 16 to help with groceries and stuff. I never cared much that my mom was around because I enjoyed the independence and that's carried on into my professional life and now living away from home.

On to this issue: My mom has had our cat for a long time. The cat is smart, and an outdoors cat, so my mom usually never fed it or anything. Of course, my sister and I made sure she was fed and had water as much as we could with the limited money we had.

My sister moved out and got a dog with her boyfriend. Unfortunately, they broke up and the dog couldn't come into my sisters new apartment. This led to my mom taking in the dog. With my sister gone, I had to take care of both pets. (Again, not a problem. Love my little pet family).

Here's where things get shitty.

My housing arrangements allow for zero pet tolerance (not even rodent pets in cages) which i totally understand from my landlords point of view. (I wouldnt want pee and poo all over my carpets either). This lead to me trusting that my mom would take care of the pets from now on. She promised she would, and I had an emotional goodbye with my dog and cat (who I mostly raised and trained myself). It was shitty, but because she promised I figured it would sort itself out.

So, over the last few months I've visited maybe three times, and every time I've come in there has been piss and shit all over the floor (cat and dog) which means my mom hasn't changed the cat litter or taken my dog out. Both look skinny, and every time i look in their bowls they're without food or drink. The pee on the ground is dark, dark yellow which means they're both badly dehydrated and livng in their own filth.

Heartbroken, I go and  buy all the necessities for them (food [dry and wet]), treats, get new litter, clean up the shit on the floor and de-stain the carpet, and give my dog a bath. EVERY TIME I VISIT.

Every time my mom says I'm just busy, i promise i'll take better care of them but it's the same story every time I visit next. I don't know what to do. I don't want to give them up (because I love them) but I'm afraid they're going to die.

He is a few years out of his third divorce and the most recent ex wife was physically and verbally abusive to him. This was quite rough to witness as his son prior to his mental health issues which have been brought about by MS. He is now in another unhealthy relationship and his new girlfriend has been pushing hard for marriage. She is looking for financial gain and control of my fathers estate and has driven a wedge between my brother/father and I. All he wants is companionship and having a friend. He will shortly need a caretaker.  He's told me he is Not looking for marriage but rather a friend and companion. She has convinced him to move away from his family &amp; doesn't show compassion or really care for him apart from hanging around because of the material things he gives her. It's a vicious unhealthy cycle.
He has periods of mental instability and has limited understanding of how bad the manipulation is towards marriage . She has taken several  coercive steps already toward control of his financial affairs and is purely seeking financial gain and control of his estate by marrying him. She set a date (deadline) last sept and the week before they were to tie the knot (noose) he found out she is over 250k in debt and is looking for someone for financial stability. He postponed things and now she has convinced him to move forward with marriage.

I'm really at a loss for how to address this situation. His mental instability is really a concern and I am in need of some guidance on how to address the situation. He has admitted everything that I've listed here and even shared that she won't care for him as his disease progresses. He is not in a healthy place where he can make rational decisions. I've been talking to him frequently but she has even tried to stop me so much as spending time with him.

946,2ongv9,"I met my girlfriend junior year of high school, been dating until recently (sophomore year of college). We go to the same college.


She had a panic attack recently and went to a doctor and got prescribed medicine and will be going to counseling in about a week and a half. They diagnosed her as a hypochondriac and having OCD.
Looking back throughout the relationship, I notice many instances of her obsessive thoughts for example, drinking alcohol or smoking marijuana will kill her, not eating one night at a chinese place in fear of it being poisoned, checking her backseats of her car for a murderer/stranger every time she enters her car. So in all of these obsessive thoughts, they are always negative situations. Also with her being a hyperchondriac, every little ounce of pain she will call her mom or stepdad (both nurses), and ask if there is anything wrong or if she will die.


Throughout our relationship, she's been obsessed with the idea of if am I the one. She believes in the romantic movie style of the one. And almost every couple we talk to, she asks how do they know if they are the ones for each other and etc. I try to tell her that she shouldn't look into the future too much as people change all the time and anything she thinks that could hinder our relationship could be compromised. Our relationship was really good, we were always building each other up and bettering each other, we were honest, we kept boundaries, kept it slow, we were ourselves, and overall a very healthy relationship based on every other relationship I've seen. We would joke to our friends that we broke up and they would just laugh at us and say Yeah right. But that idea of the one was always on her mind. I believe this to be part of the obsessive thoughts that she has.


She left school after the anxiety attack and skipped class for about 3 weeks to go home and be with her mom. I completely understood this and pushed her to go home because I wanted her to feel comfortable in this situation. I texted/called her everyday to show her I was there and wanted to help her through this. During Thanksgiving break, I went back home and tried to visit her but she slightly avoided me. She then went to Nebraska to see her relatives and I had to wait til school started again to see her.


When she got back to school, it still seemed like she was avoiding me and I got upset with this. I didn't understand what I did and I wanted to be close to her to talk to her and help her. We got in an argument where I asked her why she was avoiding me. Then the next day she said we needed to talk and she broke up with me.


She said it was because she didn't think I was the one and I just said that we are doing really good and you can't always predict the future. I tried to tell her that having a relationship only built on love and the feeling is a weak one and can be broken in an instant. I also connected this with having a Faith in God based off of the good feeling you get from church/christians and this can be broken quite easily too. Faith shouldn't be built solely off the good feeling. A relationship is built on the teamwork and how you put the other before yourself. She insisted that she had doubts if I was the one and didn't want me to go through this issue with her and be hurt in the end when we didn't end up together.


She also told me why she left to go home after the panic attack. She watched a documentary of a serial murderer prior to the attack. And she was in fear of her murdering others. This is based off the thought that these people once were normal people too. I don't think she could have the motive or even get to this point. But, the thought is what is disturbing her. She went home because she didn't want to be around people in fear of this thought including me. This is also why she was avoiding me when I went home.


Afterwards, in another incident. I told her that this may be the last time we see each other and she says Aren't we still going to be friends? I am thinking that she is still unsure about what she is doing because of how unstable she is currently. What should I do? I want to be there for her but I know I need to give her time and space. So I am not texting/calling her first to allow her time and space, but I still text her if she texts me. But It's never more than ~5 texts. What does this all mean? I still want to be with her.

Fast forward to a couple of months ago just a month or two after our 5 year anniversary and we were out at a club with a bunch of her friends who I got along with well. She is a smoker however I am not and she kept going for a smoke with a close friend of hers and I thought nothing of it however When I went to go find her and tell her I was leaving I go to the smokers area and there she is with her apparent friend kissing each other. 

Naturally I feel outraged and in a bout of anger I break them up and then proceed to punch the guy which gets me kicked out, now I'm of average build but I can pack a punch and I knocked the fella down and while I'm being trailed out of the club by the bouncers she is there caring to him. I stay outside the club for a couple of minutes when she comes out and says That was the first time it ever happened, It was a drunken thing and that I wasn't there this is her excuse. I later find out that they had been doing this for a couple of weeks everytime they were out.

I forgive her on the condition that she doesn't talk to him again and due to us being so close, she has been with me throughout the passing of my mother which created a special bond between us. 

However a couple of days ago a friend mentions to me that her and the fella had been exchanging Facebook wall posts (We each agreed to block each other on Facebook due to silly arguments) I take no notice of it as it could just be friendly banter, Her phone goes off and i see that it is a text from him as soon as I saw the name I didn't read anymore of it. Then last night at 3am while we were in bed watching a movie she receives a call from him which from what i remember went something like this No nothing just in bed, I cant right now sorry, okay bye love you She readily admitted that it was him mainly due to her being drunk I think. 

I proceed to try and talk to her about it by asking what was that about? does he usually ring out at this time? while she says she is tired and that she wants to go to sleep. So I got up and left.

867,2d38mk,"little backstory.  We started dating in february and never really had any problems.  We met in the video game club at our college, we have a lot of common interests and that fueled the relationship really well.

During the school year, I went on a trip to NYC, and it affected both of us greatly and we realized we loved each other when we got back, this was in april.  She had even told me that she had never like a guy as much as me before.

She is graduated now and living back at home.  Are plan was to wait out me graduating in a year and find jobs in a town together and move in.  She lives about an hour and a half away, so we didn't think that was too far.  We have been trying to see each other at least every other weekend and we did until this last month.  Until july everything had been fine, our meetups were great and were always very passionate.

This last month we were both very busy and stressed out.  I had school and work and helping my father with boy scouts camp.  Her mother was hospitalized for pancreatitis.  She has since recovered pretty well.  This last wednesday we talked in the morning and I ended with I love you and she did say it back.  Later she asked if i wanted to play league later that night.  I said yes and we did and voice chatted like we usually do.

After we were done playing she told me she wants to break up.  She said she just didn't have romantic feelings for me anymore.  She also said that I am super important to her and she still thinks of me as one of her best friends and really wants to stay friends.  I brought up that she told me she loved me and she said she loved me like a friend.  I asked her why she didn't feel the same and she said she didn't think we were compatible anymore and when asked to go further into this she gave examples of our taste in food and cleaning habits(which I had always fixed if she brought something up).

I am really confused because this happened so rapidly.  She said she had been thinking about it a lot since the last time we saw each other on the fourth of july, and I admit that she had given some red flags that she was thinking about ending it but I thought it would all be better when i saw her.  The whole month sucked because it had been the longest we had ever been away from each other since we started dating.  I asked if I did anything to cause this and she said no, that it just happened.

What I want to know is what do I do now?  She is the only girl I have ever dated and everything i have ever done with a girl has been with her, and I still love her very deeply.  Do I try to be friends?  Do I go no contact for a while?

Towards the end of November I (29M) broke up with my girlfriend (27F)  of two years. It was brought about by a fight, the third in a week, the second that got physical. She'd hit me before, always when she'd been drinking, and for the last year I'd been responding increasingly in a physical way, also mostly when I'd been drinking. In this last fight I think I was up in her face, can't remember what we were screaming at each other about, and she punched me in the face. I lost it and pushed her down, started punching her upper arm. Screaming screaming screaming. I dragged her upstairs to try and close her in the bedroom, when the door knocked. I went to open it and it was a guy from the next door apartment, never met him before. He looked scared/angry and asked what was going on, it sounded like someone was getting killed. I stepped outside and closed the door, noticed I was breathing really heavy, like on the verge of a panic attack. I told him we were having a fight, thanked him for interrupting, and said I was going to leave. Those three sentences took me about three minutes. I put my dog in my car and drove about a quarter mile, pulled over and curled up in the back seat with a blanket. November in VT is cold, so I woke after about two hours, drove back home, and seeing as she was asleep, fell asleep on the couch.

Next day I woke up still pissed off, went to take a leak and in the bathroom mirror saw a huge red scrape down the right side of my jaw. She had a ring on when she punched me. I went to a friend's house for the day, went back the next and broke up with her. It was hard; I still had feelings for her, I was tired of the fights and was scared that I would one day really lose control and seriously hurt her. I still am worried about my anger issues, but that's another story.

She ended up moving out of the apartment and leaving me with the dogs, I can afford to stay here more than she can, and that way she would be able to keep her job, see her dog, and apparently be around me (according to our friends). We were friendly, and slept together a couple of times; she kept on asking me if I though there was a chance we would get back together, to which I said yes, but not for at least a few months, there was work we each had to do on ourselves.

Over Xmas and New years, she spent a lot of time with me, and I was pretty much ready to ask her back, when she freaks out about my okcupid profile. First off, she got me to join. Secondly, all i wanted out of it was someone to write to. My thought process was we're broken up, what right do you have to tell me what to do, and hers was you broke up with me for these reasons, you're being a hypocrite looking for dates. That's when I had second thoughts about asking her to be with me Then a couple weeks ago, somehow my computer didn't lock (I feel very strongly about privacy, and she looked through my emails in the past), and she saw that I had visited a female friend's facebook page, one with whom I'd had a short relationship with in the past, and texted me while I was at work about that, telling me to fuck off and what a shitty person and a liar I am. Definitely don't want to get back together with her at this point, but i think that a friendship is salvageable.

Last weekend: scene: bar. Me, two male friends, one female friend, and her. Z is kind of hitting on her all night, I don't care. Me and R are talking to an older lady (older than us, maybe late 30s), and at the end of the night I approach her to ask her #. I didn't know where my ex was or what she was doing, but a minute into the conversation, she turns up behind us, and says this: Hey, has he told you he has herpes yet? Cause he does. then walks out of the bar.

Yeah I have herpes, but I've never not told anybody that risked catching it from me. And it's mine to tell, not anyone else's. I've basically stopped talking to her, and I'm so angry still that I want to get violent. Here's the kicker. Today she told me she's two weeks late and pregnant. I don't know if it's a false positive (if there is such a thing), or if she's lying, which I wouldn't put past her. Either way I want her out of my life for good.

**TL;DR** broke up with GF cause of mutually destructive relationship, still got it on for a while, was going to restart relationship but she started acting crazy. Then she told woman at bar I was talking with I had herpes, I cut off communication, now she tells me she's pregnant and I hope to god she's lying

EDIT: spelling

Update: She's apparently moving back to her home state. I haven't heard from her since the pregnancy bomb (last night 1/23/14) abd I haven't contacted her since then, asking for proof of the positive test. She also told me that if she were to have a child, i would have nothing to do with it. I can request to see a pregnancy test until I'm blue in the face but can't force her to.","Me [29 M] with my ex GF [27 F] 2 years, good breakup turned real bad",0,False,6,8,1390586617,/r/relationships/comments/1w1rr7/me_29_m_with_my_ex_gf_27_f_2_years_good_breakup/,Romantic
270,3g8tsq,"Two of what used to be my very close friends, let's call them April and May, are really making me feel resentful. For background info, April has always been a complete mess. She is a lightweight who gets depressive when drunk and I always looked after her when she was. Before she moved to my high school she was very isolated and depressed and all her school mates hated her or treated her like shit, especially her besties. She had a lot of issues because of this but refused to let them go and always prioritised spending time with them. Now I'm a pretty chill person and that never was an issue with me until now. 



Basically what happened through high school was that I was always the one to listen to her when she was down, I was always there for her, I always helped her, and so on. I did it because I care about my friends and want to help and support them. 



After high school we moved to different places and I was the one making all the effort to keep in contact. She did send me a beautiful little friendship gift for Christmas though with a letter thanking me and saying she misses me and my support and that I was always there for her. Contact was okay for a while, but then died again. No hard feelings though, we were busy with school.



Last year I lost a very close family member to cancer. It is the worst thing that has ever happened to me. Seeing them go through all that pain and suffering and them trying to keep it together broke me. They died during my exams and it's safe to say I had a bit of a pre midlife crisis. But that's not the focus here.



I was in desperate need of support and someone to talk to and I reached out to April. She essentially said Sorry I can't deal with it. Hope you are well soon. I was even more heartbroken and felt abandoned and didn't press the matter. This is what is getting to me now. After all those years of me supporting her, with me never asking for anything, this is what I get in return when I really fucking needed someone.



This is where May comes in. She has a similar but more mild history to April, and it's only recent. She ended up reaching out to me after seeing a post I was tagged in about it and really helped me during the initial shitstorm of grief. I am eternally grateful to her, I may have taken my life if it wasn't for her support.



A few months ago April and May, who were only acquaintances, starting chatting online and became best friends. I was happy for them, but when April visits these days, she only makes an effort to see May, and acts really rude to me. We made up about her not being there for me months ago, and I've been making attempts to chat for months only to get short answers, so it's not that. 



I'm starting to feel resentful towards both of them now and kind of want to cut out April, but I can't without cutting out May. I don't know what to do. Am I being stupid? Do I just need to get over it?

He hangs out with her maybe once a week, one on one because they don't have any mutual friends. He also texts her a lot and he gets mopey and snappy when he doesn't see her or talk to her for long periods of time.

He told me he broke up with her when things started to become serious between them because he wanted to have kids and she didn't so he knew that he would never marry her. That make's me feel concerned because apart from that she's perfect, I don't know if this is just my insecurity talking but she is gorgeous and smart and successful and she makes me feel intimidated. 

I've met her a few times and she was a lovely person, she was friendly to me and they appeared to have an entirely platonic relationship when I was around. But I know that my bf is very attracted to her (I think most guys would be) and he has compared me to her in the past but when he saw that it upset me he stopped.

I almost feel like he's with me because I want to have kids (in the future) but not because he really wants me as a person. Like he's settling for me so that he can have the family and future that he wants because the girl he really wants to be with wont give him that.

I don't think he's cheating on me, at least not physically but would their friendship be considered emotional cheating? Even if he doesn't want a relationship with her?

I've known my ex for 6/7 years (we met in secondary school) and we hit it off straight away. We drifted apart during school, but then we became best friends again during the last year of school, and we were very close. We both developed feelings for each other over the summer, but he had a girlfriend who he had been with for about 6 months. Their relationship went sour and they finally broke up, which led to him and I getting together last October. 

We had an incredibly loving, intense relationship for over a year, with the exception of a 4-day long break up about 7 months in. We argued, but it was always over trivial things and we made up straight away. I think our relationship worked really well because we were already best friends, we told each other everything and we were very close. We went on holidays together, discussed having a future together, and for a long time we genuinely thought that we were with our soul mates. In the last few weeks, however, we drifted apart and started disagreeing over serious things (our future, our differences in personality etc.), and we just weren't the same. We broke up 4 days ago, where he told me that we couldn't make the relationship work because although he still cares about me immensely, and loves me as a friend, he doesn't love me romantically anymore. 

Obviously I was devastated, as I still love him and I miss him a lot, but I've been able to gain some perspective and see where the relationship wasn't right. I'm able to admit to myself, now, that we weren't as close as we used to be, and the arguments were not just silly arguments anymore, there were real problems between us. I can also accept that we needed to break up, and in not too long I probably would have done the same thing. I realise that instead of getting hung up on where it went wrong, I should feel incredibly lucky for the wonderful experience we had together. We've sent a few texts back and forth since, and he said that he was upset over the break up and he wouldn't be over me for a long time, but he wants to remain friends.

I will always have feelings for him, and I know that he'll always care about me/have some sort of feelings towards me and we will always have a physical attraction towards each other. However, I've realised that the thing I miss most about him is not the sex/romantic elements of our relationship (although that was amazing for a long time), I miss his friendship and companionship. He was truly the best friend I've ever had, even before we were ever romantically involved, and he is an amazing person that I don't want to lose. I know he feels the same way and that we would work well as best friends, and we are meeting in a few days to discuss this all. I should also mention that we had planned a holiday together (already booked) for 5 months time and we are currently still planning on going, as friends.

I guess what I want to ask is that if this situation has ever worked out for anyone? I know it has done on several TV shows/films, but obviously real life is a lot more complicated. The ideal outcome of this whole thing, for me, would be for us to get to a point where we can be as close as we were before we were a couple.. I want us to be able to hang out often, just us two and with our mutual friends. Does this ever work?

However, she is still hesitant about her feelings toward me as I told her I have feelings for her.

Because of the fact that our units were next to each other, we ended up living together. We cooked together, stayed together every night, studied together etc. But we knew that he would be have to go back to England to complete his Masters. We discussed this early into the relationship, and decided on a mutual breakup for when he leaves. At the time I thought, yeah, I can handle this. I have a lot of time to prepare, we'll just enjoy this while it lasts. 

I was very wrong. We fell so in love with one another, and he became my best friend.

I'm not really sure how to approach the time in between, before I go to England. We act like a couple, skyping/messaging (he recently sent me a letter telling me he loved me and a handmade bookmark from a tree in his garden) but we haven't explicitly talked about what this is.

I also found her personal Instagram, and her posts are kind of alarmingly sad. It seems like lately she's been having some emotional issues that I'm starting to grow increasingly concerned about. Here are some of her problems: 

* she's overweight and extremely insecure about it (in her own words, she hates [her] body). From what I can glean from her Instagram, it seems like she has a lot of self esteem issues. I can't even deny that she needs to be healthier, but I can't tell her this because I don't want to exacerbate her insecurity.
* she feels insecure about her intelligence. She's not really an academically-oriented person (and I am, which I think factors into this somewhat) and she feels insecure about this. Again, this isn't even something I can deny to make her feel better, because it's true.
* she's SUPER sensitive. About everything. The littlest comments from people make her upset. I'm always the one who has to cheer her up and this worries me because obviously I can't always be around to do this for her. I don't know how to teach her 
to be emotionally self-sufficient.

Our personalities hit it off from the start and we instantly became fairly good work friends in that while we are at work we fairly often instant message each other/go to lunch/get coffee etc. We met up a few times outside of work with large groups of coworkers for drinks, but nothing one on one. 

I never let my initial feelings of attraction for her show as she was married and had been with the guy since she was 16! Almost a ten year relationship that for all I could tell, was perfectly happy. One day, during the first week of April, we were all at a bar drinking after work and everyone slowly left for other obligations and it ended up just being me and her. As we were drinking she broke down a bit (she had 4-5 drinks) and started saying that for the past year she has known she is going to leave her husband. Now, as she starts saying this I interrupted her and told her I could definitely help her by listening but I didn't want to cross any lines so let's be careful. She agreed and regained composure, and told me a story of how one year ago a major traumatic life event had inspired her to go back for a masters program, move out of her home city, travel, pick up new hobbies etc. and her husband was falling behind. The further they got the shittier he treated her until it had become a borderline emotionally abusive relationship that she was ready to end as soon as she had a plan in place.

Over the next month and a half we began talking fairly consistently about the situation as I was attempting to help her through it. Seeing her in this new light and with the potential for her to be single soon I began to allow my feelings for her to develop - and they did, very quickly. Our conversations got very personal and deep, although we never discussed mutual feelings for each other or anything related to it. 

Finally, the last week of May, I took a trip to Mexico and during that time she let her husband know that she would be leaving him, packed up her stuff and left for her parents house. 

That is the important context, the rest of the story is pretty quick: Five days later we had our first kiss, three weeks later I told her I was in love with her, a month later we spent our first weekend away together, etc. It has been a blissful ride and we are very much in love with each other. No one has ever made me happier and our personalities align together so extremely well, in ways I never considered possible. 

She has met my family four times now, and they love her. We have begun talking about long term plans with each other and unbeknownst to her I know she is my soulmate and I have every intention of marrying this girl if she'll have me. I wish I could give enough context to how batshit crazy this is for me - I have dated consistently for five years and never had a girlfriend longer than a few months, I am a very happy single person and had no intention of getting in something like this. 

The tricky part of this situation is dealing with the fallout from the divorce and our timeline, as even right now they are still trying to work out how their house will be split up. In our conversations, before we were ever a thing, it was very clear that she had checked out of this relationship almost a year and a half ago and was sticking around for her husband's sake. I would normally be weary of being a rebound in this situation but I am confident that I am not. 

However, to an outside perspective this situation looks, bad. Her parents and family love her ex-husband, and do not know about me. If our workplace found out, we would at the very least be moved departments.. if not fired. My family does not know that she is going through a divorce.

I am not sure how to move forward with this, in that if we wait to be introduced to everyone and our history and timeline is brought up it will be clear that we were hiding our relationship. If we bring it out in the open now we risk a lot of criticism and potential ramifications. I don't know what to do. We've tried holding off on the relationship, but honestly it has been near impossible. We held off on sleeping with each other until the fourth of July weekend, and haven't since, but honestly it seems silly to deprive ourselves of a physical relationship when our emotional relationship is so intense and strong. I feel EXTREMELY guilty for the situation, so much so that a few times I have been this close to calling it off. 

Am I the bad guy here? If not, how do we go about this with the least amount of reciprocal damage?

His parents (my grandparents) are good people, but they were young and uneducated when they started a family and often overlooked these abusive situations growing up as petty squabbles. My Dad still has a relationship with them, and loves them very much, but he still struggles with some bitterness. They have tried everything to get him in touch with his brothers again: apologising for not knowing and wanting to heal, minimising his experience, guilt-tripping, pleading for him to continue to be the bigger person... everything short of actually putting him in the same room as them. I know it's not a favourable light to cast them in but really, they're good people - they just hate that their family is so fragmented in their old age and they want to cobble a relationship together badly.

Now to me: I have always sided unilaterally with my father when the subject comes up but it was hard to go from a big family to a very small one overnight. My brother and I both missed our cousins a lot. It's probably also relevant that last year, one of my cousins from my Ma's side of the family died, and it was a horrible time for all. I love him very much and miss him every day... and it's hard to see our family whittled down again.

I'm currently travelling through a different country and will be here for around 6 months. At my last lunch my with grandparents before leaving, my grandfather reminded me how my cousin lives in the capital, and how much he wishes we could be reunited. Whilst I've been away, grandpa has had a few bad falls and been hospitalized, which was hard to hear from so far away because we're very close.

I've been thinking more and more about reaching out to my cousin here. I talked to my Dad about it over Skype and he said he understood/that I was an adult/that he wouldn't be hurt if I did, but he seemed still quite uncomfortable. I told him I hadn't made a decision yet because loyalty to him is my priority, but he said the right supportive noises and then the conversation dovetailed into the fact at least my uncle doesn't live in the same country so there's no risk of seeing him.

The date I arrive in the capital is fast approaching and I'm still unsure as to whether to contact him. I've found his facebook, it would just be a matter of sending a message, but there are so many potential repercussions and I'm not sure I've considered them all. If he doesn't want to meet, that's fine, I don't care about what the familial grapevine says... But what if he's just like my uncle? What if I meet him and then realise I don't want a relationship and then have to awkwardly undo it? What if we do get along and I have to deal with explaining that I don't *want* to see my uncle? What if my Dad thinks he's fine with it, but then when it actually happens, my actions hurts him? What if I'm doing this because deep down, I want to please my grandfather, and in doing so, I'm putting his wants above my Dad's need for support? What if my siblings think I'm being disloyal? What if my parents resent me for undermining the boundaries my Dad struggled for decades to set? Am I just being ungrateful in adding the risk of unnecessary drama to all of our lives (because this decision affects more people than just me) when the status quo has never been bad?


**tl;dr**: My Dad cut off his abusive siblings which meant I lost all contact with my cousins. Now I'll be in the same city as one and I'm trying to decide if getting in touch with him will be a positive thing, or cause a new generation of drama in a feud that's been going for over a decade.","I [24F] am thinking of reaching out to an estranged family member [26M] who I haven't seen in over a decade, but I'm worried about familial fallout.",0,False,4,5,1434041261,/r/relationships/comments/39gryp/i_24f_am_thinking_of_reaching_out_to_an_estranged/,NonRomantic

591,30ht59,"My boyfriend is absolutely wonderful, love him to death, but we have been having a few issues and I don't know how is the best way to deal with them. Ever since we started dating he has been dealing with varying severities of depression. He becomes overwhelmed with his Uni work because he puts so much pressure on himself to be the best... but then ends up sitting at home in the dark, procrastinating and doing nothing for (sometimes) days on end. This makes me worry so much, but I know that it is something he needs to deal with in his own time, so I always let him know I'm there for him, but I try as hard as I can not to push myself on to him. 


Unfortunately, it has, at times, affected our relationship. We both have extremely busy and fluctuating schedules. I do shift work and he is so busy with Uni he barely has time to see me. There have been times when he will get depressed and not do any work for a week, which then means that by the time I am finally free he is only just catching up on his own work and he has to cut our time together short. 


Also, because we spend so little time together I feel like all the time we DO spend together is filled with me offloading my own issues that I need support with. This means we aren't spending as much casual or carefree time together as we used to be.


I don't know what to do. I know he isn't procrastinating on purpose, and I know it's not to do with me, it's to do with his own mental health, but it is beginning to impact me. I can't get angry that he has been depressed all week... so I don't know what to say when he lets me down (ie: not showing up to events) or changes our plans. He's already seeing a counsellor (after a year of me asking him to) and he has definitely improved from where he was 6 months ago... but when things like this happen, I still feel let down, and I think I need to be able to talk to him about it... but somehow, without making him feel worse?

733,2tw6zk,"I desperately wish I could find my first throwaway account I used to make my first post here around 6 months ago for reference, but here's another one.  


I love my boyfriend like crazy. We have good chemistry, can make each other laugh like none other, and get along well most of the time. This is the longest relationship both of us have ever been in. But when we have our differences, a stupid argument almost always happens despite our many attempts to figure out how to not trigger one another during stressful situations. 


I avoid his triggers but I feel like mine don't matter as much. I feel like he'll purposefully say mean things to egg me on when he knows how sensitive I am. He also grew up in a much different, abusive environment than I did and I feel like he's always thought I don't work hard because my parents are willing to support me while I go to school (even though I share a place with my cousin just to be closer to school). 


I've been driving for 6 years and own a car, have had multiple jobs and a pretty impressive resume, on top of an AA and I'll have my BA by the time I'm 22 - he only has a permit, no car, no family in state, and one or two fast food jobs to put on his resume, a few of which he didn't put two weeks in so they don't think highly of him. 


He doesn't like when I post selfies so I haven't in months, and I think it's ridiculous. We both used to post selfies when we first started dating so I don't know what caused this insecurity in him. We have always been faithful to one another. Sometimes even taking and posting a picture of the park or someone else will trigger a really? You're posting another picture? Didn't you post one x days ago?



He's been through a lot of jobs and has kind of an attitude that I can't put my finger on. Friends and family always notice it and I'm sometimes embarrassed by his lack of tact. I worry that he's growing in age but not in maturity. 


I am unemployed and it frustrates him. But I am also more than a full time college student, taking 5 classes. I also have a savings account that I've been maintaining since I was 6 and he doesn't, nor does he understand what a supportive family feels like (which breaks my heart) but I can only do so much for him. I used to take him to work every day when he couldn't make it by bus.



My family and I always take him out to dinner, events like concerts, and we have brought him our holiday events for the past few years. I drive him everywhere since he doesn't have a car or his license. We even bought him the bed he sleeps in. My mom thinks I deserve better and has pretty much always thought that. My boyfriend is a little loud and doesn't really care about cursing in front of my family (I have a sailor's mouth but can censor myself when I need to). He doesn't always thank my parents for taking him out so I feel like I need to thank them loudly first.


We've had a lot of fights and rocky roads in the past couple years, but something has always kept us together. I love that we can always come together after a fight and talk and attempt to improve things, but I realize a lot of the time that talk is much different from action and not much has changed. 


I just need general advice. I don't feel like my boyfriend owes me anything because I've done everything out of love, but I feel like I'm not appreciated as much as I need to be right now. I'm unemployed but have spent a lot of my savings on keeping him happy and his basic needs met since he can't hold a well paying job. I'm sensitive and have depression and anxiety disorders that I've always been very open with him about. I cry when I'm stressed out and that's caused a lot of tension during arguments when sometimes I just need the comfort. I don't know, I just need heeeeeelp.

My live-in GF of 3 years and I had lived together the last year in a city in the American Midwest.  I just finished med school, obtained my MD and was offered a fellowship for residence at a hospital in a very small town in the Midwest. My girlfriend moved closer to her home to a larger city for better job prospects, which means we are at least 12 hours away so flying is the only option we are going to have to see each other.  We decided to stay together and do the whole LDR thing, but I am having second thoughts.

My program is only 24 months long, at which point I will be receiving a more permanent appointment (very likely in the same current little town) and I would love to stay here, but my girlfriend has expressed her opinion and she does not want to move here (less work opportunity, not ideal place, etc).  The distance and her decision are starting to make me doubt that I want to continue further with our relationship.

The way I see it, 2 years from now we will have to decide how to continue together.  And that is a long time, a lot of money (money is always tight, loans for med school are expensive), and a lot of spent effort in a relationship I am not sure is worth keeping/cultivating.  I got a lot of new responsibilities on my plate and I want to focus my energy on my present and future. The GF and I are very good friends, but we have little in common. Some of the flaws in our relationship I am starting to perceive as deal-breaker-type situations. Our views on what constitutes a healthy lifestyle are quite opposing.  We have very different opinions on when and if to start a family together.  I guess I am old enough that I actually saw this difference as something really unattractive.  We don’t share the same tastes in music, hobbies, etc.  Our ideas of fun are very different and I just feel like we are either no longer in the same page, or I can no longer ignore some of these differences.  Our relationship felt stale the last half a year together and I feel like we have lost the spark we once thought we had for each other.  

Am I crazy, throwing away 3 years?  Are those differences deal breaking?

I am having a hard time coming up with the courage to call this off.  And that’s the thing. In my eyes, we are done.  Not sure about how to proceed, how to bring it up, if just to be brutally honest and say that I no longer feel the way I thought I did, to soften the blow by bringing all these external excuses, or to say we need a break to buy myself time. I know I should do it in person, but it is just inconvenient right now, so phone might have to do. It is definitely better than text.email, but is it enough? I want to remain in amicable terms, for sure, and I feel like I need advice.  

TL;DR: In my mind, due to deal breaking differences my relationship is over but I want advice on how to proceed.

She also has a lot of family problems, etc. Because of those and other things, she cries often. I do my best to help, and lately, her bulimia is becoming less severe.

We are not the perfect couple. Who is? We both may accidentally hurt each other from time to time.

The problem is, I really can't tell her when she hurts me. She's very fragile.. and when she feels bad, she vomits, or does other things like that.

Its gotten to the point where I'm tired of just sucking it up and being a man about it. Whenever we argue, I always have to suck it up and say its my fault. Sometimes, it is. Sometimes, it isn't. Sometimes, its both of us.

She isn't comfortable with therapy or anything, either. She doesn't like to to talk to open up to people. So please don't suggest that.

Is there some way we can discuss things without her feeling bad? Or am I just going to have to keep dealing with this.

Also, I love her. I'm not going to break up with her. Sorry.
She also is not a bad person or anything. She's just.. sensitive. We don't have a lot of bumps in our road; when we do have them, they're a little larger than normal, though.

1027,33k2x7,"My jealousy is starting to become a problem in this relationship. Actually, it has always been. Last year, a boy my girlfriend was friends with had kept walking her to class, writing her cute notes (something boyfriends do) and asking her if she's sure about being with me. I threatened to break up with her if she never stopped talking to this guy, because he was obviously trying to make a move. Now that she's in college, she's hanging out with more guys! 75% of her friends are guys, always hanging out with her, and after the friend she had last year, I can't stop being jealous or mad about her friends. The social media part about this, guys put heart eyes on her photos on instagram, and I tell them to back the fuck up, and my girlfriend gets mad at me for confronting them! You don't know what they meant by them, it doesn't mean they're flirting with me. I understand that she is right, she doesn't respond back but she obviously likes the attention she gets. My jealousy is also fueled by my friend group. My friends have dated my exes, I've been apart of closed door conversations about how some of my friends want to fuck my other friend's ex, visa versa. I would never do that to my friends, and in my world, most guys in college or highschool just want to take my girlfriend if they hang out with her. Or want to fuck her. She has already encountered a guy trying to flirt, and she gave him her number just to talk when we were arguing and on a break from our relationship. I have influenced her as well to be jealous with how i act with my anger and jealousy, but a big break up caused her to stop being clingy. Now i'm stuck being mad and jealous towards guys around her, and now I feel overprotective.

844,1mdtbm,"I've been dating my boyfriend for about three years now and he's currently abroad in Hong Kong studying for half a semester. Things haven't been great for the last year for various reasons. He'd spent time in Korea and Japan in August and would talk to me once in a while about how lonely he was, and I would try to encourage him and cheer him up. I also took the time to find him interesting things to do and hostels to stay in because he went off on his trip with everything unplanned. About three weeks ago I fell into deep depression and told him about my suicidal feelings. He was barely there for me and didn't make much of an effort to understand my situation, check on me, etc. When I told him I felt he wasn't there for me, he turned it around and said that I didn't even bother saying thank you to him after his only advice was for me to try and get out of the house and go back to school. He'll talk to me every few days before he says he's going to bed, so we don't really get to talk much or for very long. 

A few days ago he revealed he and some girl he found on Tumblr have been messaging each other on iMessage. I've asked him a few times since spring if he'd been messaging anyone, but he said no every time. He's trying to downplay whatever relationship they have with  claims that they barely talk, but then went on to say they talk about things like relationship problems and feelings with each other (she is in an LDR too and apparently it's also rocky). I don't understand why you would discuss these things with someone you claim to barely speak to? Or why you would be so quick to add someone from the internet to your iMessaging versus keeping it all on social media. Apparently they've also gotten close enough to have some kind of inside jokes, because she made a post mentioning him on her blog. And then yesterday he revealed he's actually spoken to her for a few hours a few times, on nights where he couldn't sleep. So he's been lying and to me about going to bed and spent more time talking to her than with me, when we're not able to see each other until February or March. He has texted with her here and there multiple times a week rather than taking any time to text me, usually ignoring anything I send or saving any interaction til just before bed, so he won't have to speak to me much. When I asked him about what they talk about, he's been very vague and insists that there's nothing inappropriate going on despite the fact that he's basically admitted to opening up to her emotionally when he insists on she's someone he barely speaks to... Add to that, they've added each other on every form of social networking they're on, and he likes practically everything she posts on her blog whilst ignoring me.

Isn't this emotional cheating, or getting close to it? I have told him that this is inappropriate but he refuses to see anything wrong with what he is doing. What would be right for me to ask? I don't want him to interact with her anymore because I feel like this is a really thin line to cross. At the same time I don't want to tell him what to do because I don't want to come across as crazy or controlling. I'm worried they are turning to each other because their relationships are in bad spots.

**TLDR:** I'm in a LDR with my bf and found out he's started iMessaging with some girl from Tumblr about their feelings and relationship problems, and has been downplaying how close they actually are and how frequently they must be talking. He's essentially gone Okay, we talk once in a while… Well, actually, we've spoken for a few hours a couple of times..

Basically, my roommate (Alex) who only moved in a few weeks ago texted me last night saying that he would be bringing a friend back late tonight, and that she would staying over the weekend. Sure, whatever. No problem, I said. Have at it. 

But then he mentions that he won't actually be there with her while she stays because he's going away for the weekend. And that's where I'm feeling a bit uncomfortable. So, this friend of his (whom I've never met - and didn't meet last night because they came home well after midnight) will just be hanging in my apartment over the weekend alone. Is it strange that this makes me feel a bit awkward? I don't know this woman, never met her, I don't actually know her name and Alex has just said she can hang out in our house and have the keys for the next few days while he goes away for the weekend. Like, this isn't a hotel, man. I don't even know him that well, nevermind his friend.

Maybe it doesn't sound like much, but if you actually imagine someone in your home doing it? If he stayed with her - fine, if I had even met her - probably fine.

So, anyway. I went to bed feeling a bit uneasy about the whole thing and kind of dreading my weekend. I replied to him that I found it a bit strange, but that I supposed it was okay. Just to be amicable, figuring I would get over it when I met her, but also to give him the hint that I wasn't comfortable with it, and would hoped he wouldn't do it again.

It was like someone was having a clapping seizure in a puddle. No, GOD. I'm getting flashbacks just typing this. When I walked past his room this morning (RUNNING) to the kitchen, his bedroom door wasn't even closed...I mean - what? Why? 

I mean, come on! He cannot leave his random fuckbuddy here over the weekend, especially after that noise. How am I supposed to make small-talk with her? 

Anyway, I ended up texting him on my way to work saying that after sleeping on it, I actually wasn't comfortable with it, and it would be different if he was staying with his guest, but he wasn't and I really just wanted to chill on my only two nights off.

Have I just brought a crap-ton of drama on my head? Or does everything sound pretty reasonable? Should I wait to see if this is a one off or should I say something about the noise?

I break off from them for a moment and as I walk around from the dance floor to a smaller section of the bar, I see her, talking to six of her other friends. I nearly froze when I saw her because I liked her too back in high school but we never really said anything to each other. We hung out with different people, we just kind of expressed it in that awkward way that teens sometimes do to show interest in one other but are too scared to actually face each other. 

So, I double back to my friends and I tell them, my hs crush is right around the corner. And without hesitation, they go and talk to her and her friends to see if she remembers. After a few seconds, they come back around and tell me to come on, so we go back and I introduced myself, we exchanged smiles &amp; shook hands. This is where it gets a little weird, no less than 15 seconds after introductions, she leaves her friends and proceeds downstairs. It was so fast that by the time I turned to reply to one of my friends, his next words were, there she goes. One of her friends and I run after her and we basically asked where she was going, I didn't here what she said to her friend but when I asked she said that she had to go. Again, I shook her hand and said, it was good seeing you again and she said the same in return. 

Granted, it was near last call but she left her friends lightning fast! When I asked my friends what they said to her, they said that they asked if she remembered my name, she said no, and then they came to get me. I was really upset because I've grown more confident over the years and I've always seen her not only as beautiful woman but also as insightful and intelligent from our time together in class. I just wanted to ask whether I'm gauging this incorrectly, maybe she remembered me but she just didn't want to deal with a person from the past who she didn't really have anything other than a crush on, or maybe she really had to go lol.

1229,272ut6,"Background: Me and this girl, let's call her Sam, have been friends for about a year. I've known her for 2, but we didn't become friends until we got put into the same class. I'm a junior, she's a senior and she will graduating this year. The college she is going to is only a 40 minute drive from where I currently live. AFAIK she has never had a boyfriend.


Let me start off by saying that I'm very bad at picking up signs that a girl is attracted to me. I've had girls crush on me, then tell me later on after they stopped crushing that they liked me at one point, but i was completely oblivious to it. In the past 3 months I've noticed that Sam has been a little more flirty though, such as sending texts with hearts or kissy faces (jokingly). I also overthink everything, and imagine the worst possible outcome in situations like this.


Up until about a month ago, I couldn't see her as anything more than a friend. But since then, I've developed feelings for her. I thought it would pass, but it hasn't. I thought about asking her to prom, but unluckily the day I wanted to ask her, someone had asked her earlier (This guy is a non-factor, they went as friends, and she told me it was really awkward). I really missed out on a chance to show her I cared. In the last week, I have noticed that our friendship has been distant, and I'm afraid the feelings have passed, and I have missed my chance to pursue a relationship.


This really sucks, because now I can't see my immediate future without her being a part of it. I've never been good at keeping up with people, but I can't just forget about her. There's 2 days left of school, and I feel like I really need to come out and ask her if she likes me as more than a friend. I'm worried that if I'm wrong and she doesn't, that it will make our friendship awkward, and I'll be forced to forget about her. I'm also worried that if I don't ask her, I'll be missing out on an amazing opportunity with an amazing girl. What is my best option?

So for all the last few months involved she was jumping through hoops simply to hang out with me. I would make clear that I like her and thought the thing *can* go somewhere but all the while actually it wasn't, if anything I was friendzoning her further.

So she got tired,  thought that I'm playing with her and took distance from me. Apparently I had hurt her and *then* it hit me that all this time I had her friendzoned, not only that, my stance drove her to mini depression.

Learning those things, I came clear to her but she simply didn't believe me. She expected from me to *do* sth to prove to her that I'm for real, that I'm not playing her again.

See I'm in love with her but I'm also a f***ing coward. So no big act came from me. Instead I started avoiding her too and started writing more and more to the point that she got completely tired and exhausted from my endless messages and empty promises.

335,2msbbe,"Thank you all for taking the time to read this. I'll try to keep this as short and simple as possible. 

**My family:**

* Me, 22 F. I live across the country.

* My mom, 55 F. She has severe mental disabilities. (Not a disorder, but a physical condition)

*  Lewis, my brother. 14 M. A decent kid. 

* Amanda, my sister. 23 F. Her husband is overseas, she has two kids under 4. 

Mom, brother, sister and her kids all live together because sister's husband is deployed overseas. Names are all fake.


**Some background:**

Our abusive father passed away in 2009,. Our mother has severe mental disabilities and left my sister to care for me and our brother. Amanda was 18 at the time, I was 17, so I had to listen to her. Amanda has always had anger problems (inherited from our dad, I have them too) and is prone to snapping over the tiniest of things.

When I turned 18, I packed my things and left for college. I got my degree and my life has never been better. Amanda ended up pregnant at 19 and got married to a military guy. They had two kids and moved around the country. Lewis stayed behind and lived with our mom and did well enough to get into a magnet high school.

In early 2014, Amanda's husband was deployed and she moved in with our mom. Amanda could not afford her own place because she was just re-entering the workforce after her second baby.

**What happened:**

Like I said, I live in a different state. A few weeks ago, Lewis called me from the house phone saying that Amanda had confiscated his iPhone 6 and iPhone 4 (he has two phones, he bought the 4 with his own money). When I asked Amanda why she had done so, she said it was because Lewis was being disrespectful. Amanda had asked to borrow his laptop, but the computer had to update. Amanda started screaming at him and took both his phones. Lewis needed internet access to do his homework and talk to his friends, so I told Lewis to apologize and I told Amanda to give him back his laptop. Things calmed down, and it seemed like a normal, stupid, pointless sibling fight.

Last night, my mom left me a hysterical voicemail asking me to call her. When I did, Lewis picked up and he was crying. He told me that Amanda had smashed his laptop because he plugged in her HDMI cord into the TV instead of the other HDMI cord. Amanda had taken both his iPhones and had been screaming at him for *several hours* about how he was a terrible person and a failure, etc. It was enough to make a 14 year old boy sob, that's how bad it was.

I got Amanda on the phone and asked her what happened. She said that she had asked Lewis a few weeks ago to rearrange the cords behind the TV (she's a bit of a neat freak) and finally told him to do it while she was at work. Amanda came home from work and then snapped when she saw the HDMI cable was plugged into the TV instead of the Xbox. She told him to fix it, and Lewis 'took too long' so she pushed him aside and did it herself. Then Lewis told her to 'stop acting like a bitch' and Amanda launched into her tirade. She took away his iPhones and then followed him from room to room, screaming at him. Lewis tried to go onto the laptop to do his homework, and Amanda grabbed it and threw it onto the floor. 

I asked Amanda why she smashed the laptop, and she said it was because Lewis called her a 'slut/whore/bitch'. I asked her why she did not simply take it away and lock it in her room, and *she didn't have a reason why*. I asked her why she thought that destroying a laptop was a suitable punishment for plugging in a cord wrong, and she started shouting at me. At this point, I told her that she was being unreasonable, emotionally abusive, and that she would have to replace the laptop and give Lewis back his iPhone 4. I told her that she was justified in taking away the iPhone 6 because she gave it to him, but she couldn't take away the iPhone 4 because Lewis bought it himself. Amanda argued with me, and all I could tell her was that she isn't Lewis' mom and that she can't take away property that does not belong to her. 

At this point, she told me something unforgivable and which I will never be able to get over. I can't even bring myself to type it, but what she said I wouldn't dare say to my worst enemy. I then hung up and messaged her husband that if they do not replace the laptop, that there would be legal consequences. Her husband said that he doesn't even care anymore because she pulls this crap all the time and that I would have to deal with it. 


So that's where we are now. I'm stuck across the country trying to find some money for a replacement laptop. Our mom has regressed into her typical I don't know how to deal with this mode. Lewis managed to sneak away the iPhone 4 and hide it. Amanda refuses to listen to anyone, and has basically forgotten about what she did. Everything happened in front of Amanda's two toddlers.

350,1hsdv8,"Hey guys,

Me and my boyfriend have been going out for almost two and a half years now. There have been some really rough times and breakups that only lasted a few days, but it's been great for the most part.

We've moved in together a little over a month ago and it was going wonderful until today, where a problem that's always been around really resurfaced. 

So I've always had trust issues with him. Since the start of relationship he's told little lies and some really big ones and not once has he confessed to them; the only way I can ever find out is if I snoop around as much as I know it is wrong. Some examples: I found out he started smoking again by paying a surprise visit (not really snooping though) and lying about what he was doing (said he was going out with friends but he was at home playing games) by making an account on the game to see if he was online. To add to that, the time I found out he was smoking again I asked him directly at his house which smelled like smoke if he was smoking. He said no. I asked a third time and he said no. I believed him for a while because the window was open but it then I noticed the smell on his hair. He lied to my FACE where it was blatantly obvious. That obviously broke all the trust I ever had for him. That was over year ago, though.

I've picked up this horrible habit of snooping around his things now, though I always tell him if I do. But today I asked to use his phone so I could play an app while we were out and I noticed there was a password. I also noticed when he was logging into his computer earlier that it had a password too, which wasn't there before.

I'm convinced he has nothing to hide right now. I brought the password thing up to him and he said he just wants me to respect his privacy. I understand that totally. But then again, how am I meant to find anything out if he never tells me and why didn't he talk to me about these privacy issues first?

So I confronted him and asked to talk, which quickly turned into a yelling match with me asking why he doesn't tell me anything and saying I feel I can't trust him and he yelled about how he can't talk to me because I always get upset and everything turns out to be his fault. I don't feel that way though, I feel like I do try to listen. I don't know what I can do about this. I try my best already.

I understand that privacy is a big issue and I should give it to him, but then again I feel so insecure because of past experiences: I feel that if I give him privacy, I won't know if something that's a big deal to me happens or if he's just plain out lying to me again. My stuff is always free for him to look at, but I understand that doesn't mean I'm free to look at all of his.

Since the yelling match, he's been walking around muttering stuff and I made out fucking joke. Now he's just walked out on me saying he can't deal with this SHIT anymore leaving me crying after trying to talk. Maybe he's right in leaving to calm down before talking but that was pretty harsh. If I know him though, he won't ever want to talk about it. He usually walks away from our problems and never wants to talk. If I try to talk about things he'll say can we not talk about this.

I'd really appreciate any advice, so much. Feel free to be harsh if I need it. 

edit: I'd just like to add that he has been making an effort to tell the truth about what he's doing now and be more open, but all the little and some big lies from the past are really holding me back and I don't know how to let it go.

890,32etdt,"I'm a 29/F and feel like I may be bad at dating. I was in an abusive marriage for 3 years and have been divorced for 4 years and have only recently decided that I am emotionally ready to start dating again. If you do the math you can see that I married young and I had even dated my ex-h 2.5 years before that. I have been on a few dates since my divorce but have been very guarded. I have thrown all of my focus into my career over the past few years and am a high-achiever in my profession. I love what I do and make no apologies for the amount of time I spend pursuing my career at this point.

I joined Tinder as a joke with my friends. I was under the impression that it was a hookup site but many of them swore that they'd had great success with it for dating. Though I want a relationship, I had not made dating a priority and my friends thought that it would be a good option for me to meet people. I work 60-80 hours a week on average so finding time to even schedule a date can be difficult. 

I told my friends that I would go on ONE Tinder date and ended up meeting someone who is absolutely incredible. He is educated, intelligent, driven, insightful, worldly, kind, thoughtful, mature, and financially and mentally stable. I am physically attracted to him (though he isn't what I think is my usual physical 'type') and we have a great time together. He is much of what I didn't know that I needed/deserved to the point that I feel I've been selling myself short for quite some time. When I originally agreed to go on a date with him I was not expecting anything serious. He seemed nice enough in our previous conversations but I didn't think it would turn into multiple dates. I was mostly just going because I wanted to be a person of my word.

One thing I like about him is that he doesn't seem to play games. He's been very forthright with me since the beginning. He is eager to see me as my schedule allows and is willing to make accommodations in his very busy schedule without seeming clingy or needy.  Since our first date he has made it abundantly clear that he is intrigued by me and is hoping for many dates. He recently went out of town for an extended period of time and checked in with me almost daily. He is incredibly thoughtful and brings me a small gift (books because he knows that I love to read, things related to my profession, etc.) each time we see each other. He has been the pursuer in our dating relationship but I find myself more into him every day. He has been respectful and patient with me in the physical sense of our relationship.

We've been dating for about a month and my friends are pleasantly surprised that I have made concessions to my normally super regimented schedule to explore a relationship with this man.  

I know that it may be too soon to be exclusive but I am not seeing anyone else, mostly because I don't have time and I'm not interested in anyone else at the moment. My friends have encouraged me to keep swiping and going on dates with other people. We cautiously broached the exclusive topic a few days ago and he expressed that he is more into me than he's been into someone in a long while but that he got out of tough relationship a year ago and is enjoying meeting new people. He asked about my timeline for exclusivity and I really don't have one. Am I supposed to? The physical relationship between us has been progressing so we discussed whether or not we were sleeping with other people and neither one of us is.

In my rational/logical mind I know it's too early to be exclusive. In my emotional mind I really like him and don't want to see anyone else and if I'm being honest, don't want him to see other people either. I know this is a little unreasonable and I am determined to chill my grits for a period of time. This part of the dating process is uncomfortable for me because it involves some trust and little commitment. Trust to open myself up more and more as we get to know each other without the promise of anything more than casually dating. What happens next in a situation like this? How long do I wait?

Everything that he says and does points to him being very into me. We talk throughout the day, he got up at the crack of dawn while jet-lagged the day after returning from a cross-country trip to meet me for breakfast because that was the first opportunity that our schedules aligned. He's asked me to meet his friends. But I still feel so insecure about the non-exclusive thing. Since recovering from the abusive marriage I am a strong and decisive person and it's uncomfortable (though not bad!) for me to feel so vulnerable. I know that this is part of the dating process but it stinks! 

Is this normal? What comes next? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

About six months ago I met an amazing girl online. She was gorgeous, smart and fun, and we clicked almost instantly. Our first month we saw each other almost every day. By the end of the second, we'd told each other we loved each other.

But cracks started to form. We both had stressful lives, me finishing a big project at work and she in the final days of grad school. Add to that some health issues that came up preventing us from having sex, and tensions started to build. We started to grow apart, spending more time discussing our issues than simply enjoying each other's company. Incompatibilities started to show, we didn't communicate that well, didn't see the world in the same way. Some of my insecurities became real problems, forcing her to act as psychologist as well as girlfriend. Discussions turned into arguments, and after a few big blowups, we broke up over the phone at the three month mark when I found out she'd renabled her online dating account. She was the one to end it, but I'd picked the fight.

I was heartbroken. I couldn't remember the last time I'd been excited about someone the way I'd been about her at the outset, and that feeling of failure was crushing. After a couple weeks, I wrote her to apologise for my side of things, doing my best to be self-effacing and honest. She wrote back that it was no big deal, maybe we could be friends someday. I guess I'd been hoping for some amount of apology in return, but none was given. We go our separate ways.

The following weeks, I didn't get out much. Finishing the project at work meant spending 70-80 hours at the office a week, and I didn't have a chance to clear my head and move on. She, on the other hand, was now done grad school, back online going on dates, having the time of her life. At least, that's what I imagined... That feeling of failure turned to bitterness, resentment, and eventually anger.

7 weeks after we broke up she wrote me asking me out to a music festival, saying again how she really wanted us to be friends. Just trying to be nice. Here's where I really fucked up...

I should've just said no, sorry, it's too soon, but instead I woke up in a shitty mood, and wrote her an awful email back. Calling her on out on old arguments, demanding an apology, generally being a colossal asshole. I took out all my stress and feelings of rejection on her. I pressed send, and regretted it instantly.

Mortified, I apologised a couple days later, but it was way too late. She wrote back telling me off, saying not to contact her again. Nobody had ever written fuck you to me before, my guess is it was a first for her too. 

So, I now feel like the world's lowest sack of shit. I'm 30, I should know better than this. What kind of person behaves that way towards to someone they care about? What kind of man treats a woman that way?

I have known this girl since highschool, but we were in two completely different friend groups. I was the nerdy guy, she was the preppy girl. I was at a party and ran into her, and it turns out she's a lot smarter than she puts off. We hit it off, and start hanging out/going on dates.

Now, I'm not the type of person to get feelings for somebody easily. I normally hate most people, and when I hookup with a girl it's only for sex, but I've really taken a liking to this girl. We've been on 6+ dates that always end with us snuggled up in bed watching movies and just enjoying each others company. We've never did anything sexual until a couple days ago. She was drunk, and I was high as a kite (Which is nothing new, we always go to bars and stuff with each other and have been drunk around each other before without anything sexual happening). One thing led to another, and it was some of the hottest sex I've ever fucking had.

The next day I wake up, and she's like So, what brought on last night? I told her the moment felt right, and I could tell that she wanted it. Her response was, If I wasn't drunk, I wouldn't have done it. I don't mean that in a bad way though, because I truly don't regret it. It just seems sleezy. Even since then, we still talk and text each other, but she hasn't wanted to hangout for 3 days (We normally hangout all weekend because that's the only days we have off together). She befriended a girl I know at a party we had went to that night, and she's been hanging out with her.

My questions for you guys. How can you say I wouldn't have done it if I wasn't drunk, but not in a bad way? I know she's more than likely just having girl time with her new friend, but I'm still a bit worried she's lost interest. I don't gain feelings for people often, feelings are kind of like a fancy restaurant to me. I don't go to a fancy restaurant often, so I have no fucking idea what to do with all the forks. This is the first time I've had true feelings for a girl since my last girlfriend of 3 years, which ended in 2011, so I'm a bit rusty.

Sophie and I met at university over ten years ago. We became fast friends and we did EVERYTHING together, short of being roommates! Literally, we hung out all the time, had classes together, all the usual college girl things, etc., we even went on a study abroad together. We traveled together, we were going to take on the world together! After we both graduated university, Sophie moved back in with her parents about 1.5hr away from where I lived. We saw each other less, because we were both working, and it was a hefty drive to make for getting coffee. We got to the point where we only got together if we'd planned a shopping day or the movies, etc.


Sophie got kindof depressed once she moved back home, and she also developed thyroid issues (not sure how much of the 'depression' might be from that). She was stuck living with her parents, who are not the nicest people - the silent-treatment, nasty quiet type (her dad and mom fight with each other like that all the time, the silence is murderous) - and she held a job she really disliked. She'd graduated with a degree that made finding a job difficult, and she didn't have a lot of friends to hang out with at home. She didn't have a lot of money to do anything, either. I tried my best to visit her, and call and hang out, but my job was taking off, and I was working a lot, and I'd just become roommates with a different friend of mine, had just started a new relationship with my now fiance, and I had a lot of new, good things going on. 


After a year or so of being at home, and an additional 6-month overseas work-study (we occasionally skyped), she applied to grad school, was accepted, and moved to the other side of the country. She got an apartment (which she hated), was constantly broke, and had a lot of stress on her from grad school. She complained about EVERYTHING - the girls in her classes, her neighbors down the hall, the parking situation in a big city - there was NOTHING nice she had to say. We started to drift apart. I just didn't have a whole lot to say to all that, and it was hard to listen to it all the time. Our texts and phone calls got fewer and further between. She's been there now three years, and it's still a complaint-fest. I still don't understand it, because I am a get up and go-type person, I solve these problems and I make the best of things that I can. I'd be having a blast at grad school in a big city. But I know she is working hard at school, which is stressful, and the depression/thyroid makes it worse, and so I try to be as supportive and encouraging as I can.


Two years ago, she came home for the holidays. I threw a holiday party at a local club, and invited her and a whole host of my friends, some of which were mutual. A friend of mine brought her brother (who I went to high school with) and Sophie and he hit it off. Now, he's an odd, engineering/IT type, and he is very anal and OCD about things, and not in the nicest way. I would not normally have invited him to my party, nor was I ever interested in him, we didn't really hang out. Anyways, they hit it off, I didn't think too much of it, tbh, other than hoping she was happy, and also thinking slightly that she deserved better. Personally, I think it was a case of right time, right place - she was depressed and he was the first guy who paid attention to her and she ate it up. I feel bad about that, and I'm not trying to be judgmental, but that's how I felt. I did not tell her any of that, of course. They long distance it for a little while, and about six months later, this guy MOVES to her state and BUYS a house near her school. He commutes to a completely different state two weeks of every month for work, and works at home the rest of the time. He makes her stay at his house and watch his crazy dog, and take care of things - and she was not happy about it. Or at least, she complained about everything to me. But she still does it.


In the meantime, Sophie makes a few trips down here to visit family, bails on dates we've planned to get together several times. Just completely flakes out for whatever reason, or invites me last minute to tag along to plans she's already made with someone else at a time she knows is inconvenient for me (like when I'm working - I work 9-5 M-F, not a crazy schedule).


This past summer, I moved in with my boyfriend of 4+ years. Three weeks later, Sophie tells me she is moving in with her boyfriend (even though she's still paying for her apartment for a year, can't break the lease). Over Thanksgiving, my boyfriend proposes. Over New Years, they get engaged, too. I plan my wedding for this summer, and she plans hers for the following year, in the same month as me, two weeks prior to my date (ie: I'm April 30, 2014, and she is April, 15, 2015). I'm trying not to be petty, but that was a little weird.


I asked her to be in my bridal party - and it was pulling teeth to get her to say yes. She got wishy-washy about it, asked for me to send her a will you be my bridesmaid present, and I finally nail her down one night and asked point blank WILL YOU BE ABLE TO BE HERE AND WILL YOU CONFIRM THAT and she says yes, she'll be here. Now, we're having a destination wedding, with a small ceremony here before we leave. Sophie is only coming to the ceremony part, which is fine, I just want her there, but a lot of our friends and family are coming to the destination part, and I sort of would have liked her to be there. Once upon a time, I really would have wanted her to be my maid of honor. As it is, since I only have her and my other bff in the wedding, they're kindof co-maid's of honor anyways. I just felt that if I'd titled my other friend Maid of Honor instead of her, it would have been nails in the coffin of our friendship, and I didn't want to be the one to do that. My other bff is totally understanding, as she's seen Sophie and my relationship like this for a while, but I feel like I've done her a disservice. I am really understanding - Sophie has to fly down here for the ceremony, she has also additionally decided to fly down for the bridal shower, and so she doesn't want to go to the destination part. I am OK with that. I understand that is a huge thing to ask. I wasn't even asking her to come down for the shower. I understand she has work, and school, and is broke (and her fiance doesn't help her out at all, even though he makes good $$). I only wanted her here to stand by me at my ceremony. I don't know if I will be in her bridal party, she hasn't asked officially yet, but there is an assumption that I will be because we've always talked about it, same as she expected to be in mine.


Today she sends out a facebook event (and she doesn't even text me about it - we used to talk about things like this! I never found out things just on facebook!) It is a engagement/birthday party for her, where in five months from now, she's invited me, and a bunch of other friends, to come up to her and her fiance's home and stay for the weekend to celebrate her birthday and also her engagement. Now, she got engaged over last New Years. To celebrate an engagement nine months later seems odd to me, NEVERMIND the fact that this party is four weeks after my destination wedding, and a lot of the same people she's invited are going to our destination wedding. She never said a word about it to me, just sent an invite on facebook. There's no way I will be able to attend, especially right after my wedding and honeymoon. I don't even know that a lot of other girls will go, because they're coming to my wedding (nevermind the cost of flights, etc)! I'm afraid Sophie will have no one show up, and go into a spiral of everyone hates her and feel like she has no friends.


I just don't even know what to do with her. I am trying so hard to love her through it, and hope in another ten years we will look at all this and laugh. I just don't know how much I can expect her to change. She is miserable, has gotten herself into a relationship that will only make her more miserable, hates school and her job, and it just doesn't look much brighter for her in the future. I miss the fun, carefree person I became best friends with. I don't want to see her get divorced in ten years, or end up like her parents, or end up in a shitty, miserable job for life. I hate this sarcastic, flaky, depressed, stressed out girl who can't even be bothered to put effort into our relationship. But I feel so much loyalty to Sophie because we've been friends for so long! I am trying so hard not to be judgmental or critical, but she is just living her life in a way I do not understand very much, and can hardly relate to. Am I being super unreasonable?

1015,30hyqw,"My girlfriend and I are in a rather steady relationship ( no on-off, no major arguments etc ) and so far, I'm genuinely extremely happy with her. Nearer to the start of the relationship, we had sort of a sex talk, and she made it clear that she does not want penetrative sex until she's 20. She said that she'll only be ready for sex by then. I'm fine with this, and we concluded the talk happily.

Throughout our relationship, we had a few more of such talks, and she asked if I'm handling the no sex till 20 rule well. I have extremely high libido, and I'd really love to bang her right now. We have pretty transparent communication, so I let her know that I respect her decisions, and I'm willing to wait, but if she ever changes her mind and decides she's ready, I'm more than happy to do it. Whenever she asks me if I'm horny, I will tell her honestly that I'd love to do her there and then, and she'll tell me  wait till I'm 20 .

So this month, her period is already late by two weeks. We showered together a few weeks ago, and I ate her in the shower while she gave me a bj. We both came, but within seconds all the discharges were gone with the water. She became extremely paranoid that somehow, she got pregnant. I kept telling her that it's because she's under a lot of stress recently and she's sick, hence her period is late, but she refuses to hear any of it and insists that there's a high chance she's pregnant. In order to calm her down, I bought a pregnancy test kit, and sure enough, it's negative. She finally calmed down, and we didn't talk about it anymore.

I thought this was the end of the matter, but just now, she told me this.  You know, if the test result was positive, I'd have let you fuck me there and then.  

I'm not sure why, but this sentence affected me a lot.

1. Does this mean she's actually ready for sex already, but she doesn't want it? Because I don't see the link between being ready for sex and being pregnant.
2. Why did she tell me this, fully knowing that I'm trying my best to ignore my horniness and just wait till she's 20?

Awhile later, her mood suddenly changed and she said  please don't get me pregnant on purpose just so you can fuck me.  This sentence left me extremely hurt. We've been together for a year, I've been nothing less than faithful and understanding, but it seems that she thinks I'm capable of doing that.

Am I overreacting? Did she say that just because she was relieved at that moment, without really meaning it?

I felt that I spend a very, very reasonable amount of time focusing on myself and took time to re-discover myself.
____
I have been in three relationships where I felt a strong connection:

* First, lasted 6 years, he ended things with me, because he had really poor self-esteem. He dropped out of college and took a dead-end job, and then broke up with. It was hard, because he knew I was never concern about that and only wanted to be with him. He said he wanted to let me go. My heart was crushed.

* Second relationship, 4 months: He ended it with me, because he said I was a girl someone should just get married with, and he doesn't want to settle. In the end, I didn't really care too much about this one, because I didn't understand what he was trying to do and he sounded silly?

* Third relationship, 1.5 years: I thought I met the perfect guy...He ended things with me because he thought I had too much experience after being in a relationship with someone for 6 years. He said I was everything he wanted, just as I felt that he was everything I wanted. But my ex was on the back of his mind, because we were together for so long. I can't change my past...I'm still aching from this prevoi, because I was really completely in love with him.

So overall, it seems that the common factor of the breakup is that they don't want to settle with me? I'm not even looking to get married and have kids or anything right away!! I just want a sweet guy who I can with connect with intellectually and enjoy spending time with. I just want to have a lasting relationship. What am I suppose to do? 

Aside from these three exes, I dated two other guys (2-3 months), but I ended things with them, because I didn't feel challenged with them. As I get older, I find it harder to meet people I'm interested in...

So the last 3 months have been like a rollercoaster. Just for some 
heads up clarification were both in Jrotc.

Me and my friend, we started talking again, just as friends as the new school year started, she had a boyfriend and I had no plans to try anything with her. The winter ball comes for our unit and her boyfriend just decides to dump her 3 days before. I get a text the night before asking to be her escort, which was no big deal to me friends ask friends to do this stuff all the time. The night goes on and we dance a couple of times, both of which she says Lets kiss at the end. Bewildered and confused i didn't and we laughed about it. 

A month fast forwarded and we start talking more and more than before. We had a drill meet coming up that was 2 hours away from us which ment, 2 hour bus ride at 5am. I was used as a pillow with my arm wrapped around her. Day goes by and its just alot of flirting, we end up making a bet, I win she has to kiss me and if I lose I have to kiss her. I lost of course. I didn't get to do it that day but the following Monday on a trip to a navy ship. 

We walked up onto the flight deck and I just did it, it wasent long, but it was my first kiss. It was good, but I didnt ask her out. 2 weeks later I end up learning how to play a bieber song on guitar for her, because she asked. The day I was going to play it for her we kissed again. I had plans to sing it for her and ask her out there but never got the chance to. 

Final school drill meet, we talk about or second kiss indirectly on the bus, she said You do it too loud, ill show you how to do it Near the end of the day, we just finished off performing the last of our teams, we get back to the classroom and start talking about last year and the past. We were just about to leave to go Find the bathrooms (To go kiss somewhere in the school) But we had to go down to knockout. Get back early and we go run off, and share a minute maby two of kissing, off alone. After we did she told me what are we up to 6? Don't worry well end up loosing track

Get back to the class room and no ones there, a parent told us they were looking for us. Fuck they started awards early. Walking down I get a call from our senior cheif asking where we are, we make up a shit excuse and he turns livid about what we did. We had to explain after that day, nothing happened and were just friends, just so both of us dont get ranked stripped and fired. We planned to wait for it to blow over. She asked me to go to the mall the next saturday but we both ended up having to do something. 

2 weeks. 2 weeks of really nothing, I start to feel im losing her and shes going to lose interest in me. So I took advice from my friend at work(Old guy, smart and nice, around 40-45) just ask her to the movies. It was what felt as a last ditch effort asking her to the movies like this. I asked her if she was free saturday and she said possibly why? I replied with Movies?


Got an okay! as a response and went to bed afterwords. It was bad, a bad way to do it but it felt like it was my last chance..
I dont even know what movie to go see! We didnt discuss that at all. What should I talk about tomorrow? Bringing up the movie and what to see, what time? I just feel like since everyone in our unit always jokes about us in a relationship that I wont be able to follow through with this...Im scared, I need help. please help.

I went to a different school after and they stayed together for the next 2-3 years(on and off). I met her again on the the tail end of that relationship via a friend of hers I was having a fling with. 


I and never really had any intention of pursuing anything with Ann because I considered Bob a good friend and frankly, I meet a lot of women so being denied one doesn't particularly bother me. I've only ever tried to be a good friend to her.


We kept getting closer as friends and she's now very important to me. We get on amazingly well together and always have great fun. She buys me gifts (usually unreciprocated - I'm broke), she's really supportive of me, pays for a lot of my shit when we go out drinking and is heart-warmingly thoughtful. My friends and family (and everybody else) all love her and she is extremely beautiful!


We're suppportive of each others relationships and as long as nobody gets between us, the fact that we get involved with other people doesn't really bother either of us. 
People who know our relationship groan and think we're in denial about our feelings for each other, seeing it as an inevitability that we will get together eventually.


Her only major blemish in my eyes is that I know she's cheated some of her boyfriends with Bob. She's tried to hide this fact from me but I know from Bob. 
I fear she'd do the same to me. I'm terrified of the old cliché where the girl runs off with her low-life ex-boyfriend. I sometimes think Bob has a strangle-hold on some of Ann's more childish interpretations of what love is supposed be.

I do think if I made a pass at her it would work and we could make something of it.
Part of me thinks everyone just wants to see some hollywood ending and I definitely go through short periods where I play with the idea(right now). I had just recently come to the conclusion that - No, I dont want to be with Ann, I don't trust that a cheater won't cheat again. Then, today I get a msg telling me to not make any plans because she has a surprise for my bday(in a few weeks), and my sister telling me I need to wife this girl quick. 


Maybe I am special to her(she treats me like I am) and she wouldn't be lured away during a lull in the relationship, and we'd probably have an amazing relationship together.

My mom can be extremely protective, and I think I've actually been brainwashed into feeling immense guilt if I ever lie to her, so I made the mistake of mentioning our Valentines Day plans. I wasn't asking for permission whatsoever, but she always assumes I am, and basically mentioned how much she disapproved of a hotel and that if anything happened (i.e me getting pregnant), my dad would blame her and it would start a fight. I really want to go, but feel too guilty to lie to her and say we're staying with his parents instead.

Neither of us are really gung-ho about jumping into a new relationship, as we've both been in serious things that were recently painful, but it seems the direction we're going. We agreed on sexual exclusivity almost immediately (she said she hadn't slept with anyone for 6+ months, and I for the most part believe her.) 

We're both pretty busy and don't see eachother too often, and work different shifts, so progress is slower. We've talked about how we're heading down the relationship sort of path, and agreed to not rush anything, but to essentially go in that direction. 

Anyway, we were watching a movie on a laptop she just got and I glanced at her mail application in passing. 4-5 emails from an extremely popular nude webcam app in the most recent inbox. I think she mentioned to me in passing when we first started hanging out something about having considered doing that sort of thing in the past at the behest of a friend, or something to that effect. 

I didn't say anything negative about that then, as I was just kind of getting to know her. I don't think the realistic expectation is for me to be okay with this immediately, or else she probably would've mentioned wanting to try it more recently.

962,2yf7e7,"I suppose the title sums it up a little bit. We have been together for just under 5 years. She is my best friend and I love her, and I know that she loves me too. I don't doubt our connection together, and we usually always have good conversations and lots to talk about, and enjoy each others company more than any other persons. We have a 1 year old daughter and we both love her dearly. In most every way I feel like I have a perfect relationship. She is kind, supportive and makes me feel great about myself, I do my best to return these things and try to help out around the house (Although it seems she does do more...) and with our daughter. I support her and always encourage her goals and try to lift her up. 

In the beginning of our relationship the sex was great (I thought) and she didn't say or mention anything otherwise. We were long distance for a little while and really enjoyed seeing each other and hooking up for the weekend. We had regular sex, kinky sex, oral sex, everything.

Then she got pregnant, and we moved in together. We actually had great sex during her pregnancy (I thought) and things were going really well. However more and more, I noticed that she never really initiated sex with me after moving in together. Then one night wile having sex she just stopped and said I can't feel anything, I hate having sex. I didn't really know what to do, we sort of just went to sleep and didn't talk about it much. There were a couple of arguments related to that night. We sort of went on with things and had sex but she doesn't seem connected or caring. We have communicated since then a handful of times on the subject (most recently tonight) and she says that she can count the number of times she has reached orgasm through intercourse on one hand, and that I represented about 2 of those occasions throughout all of her relationships. Over the past year since our daughter has been with us, she has *never* initiated sex. She does have sex with me but doesn't seem to enjoy it, and when I ask her if she wants to switch positions or something like that she just says I don't care. Tonight she got frustrated during sex and said she can't feel my dick inside her and that it was the same as having a finger in my nose or something, ie: doesn't feel like anything pleasurable, just light meaningless pressure. 

She opened up to me a lot tonight and said that she just never has enjoyed sex except for a few very select occasions. She told me that she hates having sex because it doesn't do anything for her. I have given and do give her oral sex more than we actually have intercourse, and she does orgasm but says that it's not very satisfying and she has to concentrate on reaching orgasm just to please me and so I won't be down there all day. She said that she has sex with me so I won't leave her, and so I'll feel satisfied because she loves me. She doesn't initiate the oral sex either and after tonight it sounds like she doesn't even appreciate it (I initiate this because I like going down on her). She did say how much she hates that she doesn't enjoy sex, and really wants to be feeling the things I am, and to orgasm vaginally.

I don't know if this matters but her dad left when she was like 6, and they've only recently reconnected but they seem really happy and content about it, she is happy to have him in her life again. He is a nice and caring person. Her mom is very prudish and highly religious. Her mom raised her and her sisters alone.

She told me she would like to be more romantic and go on more dates and that she doesn't feel very sexy very often. I am trying my best to do those things now and be more attentive to our romantic relationship. It's hard while having a kid though. I am taking her to the symphony soon and took her out to a nice dinner recently. 

I'm not sure what to do. I told her I will do anything to help us get through this, ie: counseling, tantric sex, etc. And she seems like she might be interested in that, but I'm not sure. Is this a problem for anyone else? I feel like a complete failure and don't know how to please her.

640,1x6h1e,"After a year together, we finally had a few serious talks about our problems with intimacy. These problems stemmed from  us getting into a routine when we have sex, which was making it boring and uncomfortable for her. She then went on to say that she has only had 5 (or so) orgasms whilst having sex with me. I haven't had many sexual partners before her, so I have never been clear on exactly how to help things, which made me become selfish whilst we were having sex.

We are currently not in the same country, but when we see each other again we have decided to try and start fresh (2 weeks time). 

My problem with this is that she has been unresponsive and almost mute during sex and foreplay and feels incredibly awkward when we talk in great detail about what might help. I honestly want nothing more than for her to enjoy herself, but that is hard when she doesn't want to talk in detail.

I've never really asked her about whether she masturbates before, until today, and she cringed after I said the word. Once she finally answered, she admitted that she has barely ever masturbated and she never really had an orgasm whilst doing so. I raised a point that if she doesn't know how to pleasure herself, then how am I supposed to know.

I am sure my selfishness previously had a lot to do with our problems, but now I am trying to talk about it, it is like she doesn't even believe that things can change.

Any ideas/help is much appreciated.

1025,3h6ud9,"Girlfriend and I had a great time and didn't suspect anything was going downhill until about 6 weeks ago. She has received a new job and has worked tons of hours. However,  we completely stopped making love and she claims its due to stress from work and school.

Furtherhmore, this guy pops up and is constantly hitting on her and trying to get to know her. Happened before, she usually ignores it. But I come to find out she talks to him and for some reason he is unaware that we are dating. I told her why she didn't tell him we were dating but denies it and said she did tell him.

I tell her to please stop speaking to him outside of work she said she would but I find out he 'waited for her at her car' (which she did tell me) and they talked for about 2 hours. At this point I told her to never speak to him again or I will speak to him myself. She said please don't because it will make it awkward at work.

Within the past 2-3 weeks, I was at her house and she lets a He's so stupid. slip and I ask her who and she says nothing. I ask a few more times until she tells me and we have a big fight over this and she says she won't talk to him anymore.

Few weeks later shes back at my house and receives a snapchat from him. She had blocked him from receiving calls but didn't block him on snapchat which lead me to believe just blocked him so he didn't text her while she was with me again. I tell her are we going to work this out and she doesn't seem willing so we break up. I come to find out that she ran to him after we broke up to what she claims out of spite.

She says she is willing to work things out and suddenly has a complete change of heart. We are at the movies and I look over to see who texted her and of course its him, and he send a picture that says When she watches netflix with you, eats pizza, and let's you touch her butt. I lose it and we argue for awhile over this and she says will help me get through this and knows it looks bad.

Another text I read says, It really hurts to hear you say you still love him even though I had already knew, it feels bad to know you are done with me and going back to him. This would automatically lead me to believe she is cheating otherwise however as I said before she went to him after we broke up.

She seems to really be committed to me now and I believe she either really didn't do anything or feels guilty about it and doesn't want to lose me. Everytime I think about it, it eats me alive and I don't know what my course of action should be. She hasn't admitted to anything and at it's come to the point where she gets annoyed when I ask now.

630,1yva4k,"Two Thursdays ago I met this really cute guy (so not this past Thursday but the last one) at a fraternity party. I am in a sorority and he is in the fraternity my sorority usually mixes with. I went up to him, we started talking casually (we were both pretty drunk), and then he kissed me and we proceeded to make out for about an hour on the dance floor. He asked me to go back to his place, and so I did (I'm not really the slutty or one-night stand type but he was so cute I couldn't resist) and then we just made out for like 3 hours and talked a lot. It was clear he wanted to have sex but I made it clear that I don't really do that the first time meeting someone, but I felt somewhat guilty about it so after I left and we exchanged numbers I texted him apologizing for leading him on. He told me not to worry about it and that not everything needs to happen in one night. He said you're cool and I like you. I hope to see you again soon.

Wasn't really expecting to hear from him again just because he seems way too good for me, but late (around 11-12) Saturday night he texted me asking if I could come over to his dorm room. I went over and we talked for about an hour and really seemed to bond. He had a few drinks in him, as did I, but we were both mostly sober. We then hooked up again for another 3 hours and it was the most amazing hook up of my life. It was so sensual and amazing and I literally loved it. We mostly just made out (he did finger me) but I offered to give him head (not in like a weird way, I was going for more of a sexy direction) to which he said next time. I don't want to pressure you into anything. I responded saying you're not pressuring me and he said next time. So fine.

We make out more and more and then it was like 4 am and I told him I should probably leave. He asks me to stay the night just so we could cuddle. I told him I wish but I need to be up early and I really need a good night of sleep. He said fine and then I stood up, put my clothes back on, and as I was walking out the door he picked me up and dragged me back to his bed and was like stay please and I was like whyyy and he was like I like spending time with you. Which of course melted my heart into a massive puddle. I again told him I had to leave, and so I did, and then he picked me up again and brought me back to his bed. This whole cycle repeated probably 4 more times. 

When I finally left I told him I was really sorry for leaving and that I wish I could stay over, and he said in a really sweet voice you don't need to keep saying sorry; it makes me feel bad. That was the last time I talked to him. That night may have been the best hook up of my life but it also made me feel like it was much more than a hook up, especially since he wanted me to sleep over so badly.

But its been over a week without any texts or talking to him. I've seen him on campus in passing about 5 times, each time he's smiled at me. But still I haven't heard from him, and I am not going to lie I am really hurt by this. I just don't get it at all: why would he say next time and want me to stay over if he had no intention of texting me?? And why smile at me every time he sees me but not text me?
I'm literally at such a loss and I've been in a rut for the last week about this. I know it might be crazy because we only hung out/hooked up twice- and I know many of you think I should forget about him and find a new guy- but he really made me feel like he liked me and that this could go somewhere and I just never heard from him. I've also asked tons of people about him who know him and they all say he is such a nice guy... so what the actual fuck.

Here's the thing, I don't know what to do. I keep seeing him on campus (I just saw him in the library which is what spurred me to write this post) and I just found out that we are having a party with his frat on Saturday. Which means I'm going to be in a social setting with him. And not only will it be this Saturday but there will probably a party with him every weekend for the rest of my next 3 years at this school. I don't want to approach him Saturday just because I feel like that would be even more embarrassing if he's not interested than me texting him (he may approach me but most likely not and that is unpredictable). 

I am upset about this because I really felt like we developed a connection that is pretty unique and I honestly want to have another chance with him. I firmly believe he is not an asshole, either he: a. thought our hook up was pretty casual and kind of forgot about me or b. he decided he doesn't want me or c. somehow in some miracle could (hopefully) maybe like me, though that's completely unrealistic. But I still want another shot with him.

Some of my friends tell me I should forgot him (which is hard when I keep running into him) and ignore him this weekend. Others tell me I should bite the bullet and text him, that way if he responds maybe I could have another shot and if he doesn't respond I'll know for sure he's not interested. If I do text him, though, and he doesn't respond it is going to be even more awkward at all of the parties we will be at together. I don't know how to approach this situation at all (I know it would be best to forget him and move on, but easier said than done especially since I am decently picky and the pickings are slim at my school) and I am sick of listening to my biased friends for advice. If you have any opinion on this matter please share. I'm just so lost because he really made it seem like he liked me and I really do like him but I don't know if I should try for another chance with him or just give up. I just never feel this way about guys and I know him and I barely know each other but I really feel like we could become something. Basically, the fundamental question here is, do you think this situation could be salvageable? And if not, why did he seem so into me (wanted me to stay over just to cuddle) if he wasn't interested? I really would love some closure on this, so thank you in advance for any suggestions and sorry for the incredibly long post.

TL,DR: Met a guy, we hooked up twice on separate occasions, he made it seem like he liked me and I really liked him, but I haven't heard from him in over a week and we will be at the same party this weekend and I just generally don't know what to do.

I am posting on here because of a promise I made with him. I promised that I would tell him if I felt I was falling for him. I know it will sound silly to some, but I most certainly think I am.

I've never fallen for anyone I've never met before. This whole concept is rather foreign so any advice would be appreciated. Should I just tell him? Do it via text? Phone call? Wait until I have no doubt?

1182,1k0kx1,"So I have been dating this women who also happens to be on reddit for almost three years. Our anniversary is in the very beginning of September one week before my birthday.


We have been long distance for about one year and a month as of this writing prior to that we lived within a half hour of each other. 


Things have been rather testy though lately because I had worked out a plan with her which she initially agreed to which at the end of said plan was going to have me moving back to her(in janurary of 2014). The reason for that date so far ahead was to give me time to save up money and also try and find a job and plan all the other logistical hurdles that come with a move.


In that plan it was decided that she would visit me once then I would fly out to visit her on her birthday, and then come September she would fly out to me for our anniversary and my birthday since the fall within a week of each other. However recently(I.e. the past couple of weeks) she has tried to weasel out of this by saying it was a cost issue initially. i cant get into to much detail about her financials out of respect for her privacy but she is infinitely better off than me to the point that a plane ticket would barely make a dent, in her bank account.


However I was later able to discern the real reason and that is she just doesn't want to travel because it require too much effort. 

Now i have an issue with this for many reasons.

1.she previously agreed to come to me for our anniversary 

2.it is more practical for her to come to me because I have a job that would not allow me to travel to her as it is.

3.I put the effort to make it to her on multiple occasions and I am moving to her.

4.My cousin is having a wedding in November and as it stands now i have plans to go out of my way to be able to spend time to visit her then in addition to my commitments for the wedding.

5.The fact that traveling takes too much effort now when she has traveled to me in the past does not sit right with me. She keeps adamantly saying that is the reasoning but i for whatever reason dont believe it.

and even if that is true it comes across to me as shallow and is still not an acceptable reason because the whole point of being in a relationship is putting in that effort.

Now I have made plans last minute to go and visit her for a little bit next week to try and work this out/try and convince her to come for our anniversary. But i also am unsure if this is even worth my time and I should just break up with her.

She says she does not want to break up and crys on the phone every time I try and convince her to come to me because she feels like a terrible person but then again she is not willing to come to me still.

When i told her i was coming she said that was crazy and I am inclined to agree with her but for whatever reason at this point in time i am doing it.

I guess what I am asking is am i right to feel the way i feel which is frustrated and angry with her. Because despite her profession of her love she is unwilling to make that minor effor to come to me.

Or am I wrong to feel the way I feel.

Also am i handling this correctly.

If you need more information I will provide it, I apologize if I am missing anything.

I also apologize for poor grammar I will edit this is the morning when I wake up.

Finally we live 3000 miles apart currently.

657,3ce5j4,"My boyfriend and i have been together for almost 8 months. We love each other quite a lot, and things are going great. He's genuinely a very thoughtful guy, and he is an active feminist (relevant to this story.) This issue is not really a problem in any way that will affect our love for each other, but it makes things uncomfortable.

We both have good jobs, but he just simply makes more and has more in savings. I am not bad with money, but I had a lot of family, health and educational expenses that made having a lot of savings more difficult for me, and I started my career later due to a career change. I'm managing though, and things are looking up, and I'm very proud of my accomplishments and my financial future is bright. 

I have always felt very strongly about paying my own share of things in a relationship, but I've never been in a very serious or long term relationship so this is new territory. I do not want to feel like I owe anybody or that I'm a burden. He is incredibly caring though, and he likes to try to pay for our meals together. Thus far I've been able to get him back off and let me pay my own share more often than not, only paying for mine if I've recently cooked him a meal and purchased the ingredients, and we get along with this arrangement. 

Now, he very much wants to pay for a relatively expensive vacation for the two of us this winter and I can probably afford it, I just need to be able to budget for it in advance. But since I recently had some medical hardships, he would like to pay for it. 

I feel really bad about this, because it's always been a source of pride that I am able to take care of myself financially, and I'm smart enough to budget and plan ahead. I don't have a full scope of the expenses yet, but I feel confident that I can probably save up enough in time for this trip. 

I feel like I'm constantly having to make the argument that I'm capable of being financially independent and I always feel like I'm on the defensive. He logically is in a better situation to make this gesture, and if I were in his position, I would want to do the same thing. I admit that I have a weak argument against this, and he is logically quite correct and I absolutely love him for his gesture.

However, I feel very conflicted and I'm not sure how to work with this, because on one hand I'm a strong independent woman who don't need no man (that's a funny joke phrase and all, but I'm serious too!) because I have a good job and I can absolutely do this, and on the other hand he's sort of right, I've had a lot of hardships this year and he is only offering to do this because he wants to make things easier for me.

647,21cxi6,"My girlfriend and I moved in together 6 months ago. Lately whenever we have a little squabble about something, she has said that maybe she isn't the one for me because I'm not showing her enough praise/love/affection. She says it feels like we're sometimes just roommates and not really bf/gf because I don't compliment her enough and make her feel loved enough.

Here is what we did the last week for example:

1- Went on a weekend ski trip nearby. Stayed at a hotel Friday/Sat and went skiing on Saturday, tubing Sunday. I planned all of it. I'm an expert, she is a novice, so we stayed on the easy runs. The first run we went on she was scared because it was somewhat steep for a Green run, and so she got flustered and mad at me for not finding an easy run. Partway down I directed us to an easier run. About an hour later she fell over onto soft snow doing about 1mph and I laughed. She thought it was insensitive to laugh because she might have been hurt (0% chance of that), so the other 6 times she fell I didn't laugh, just helped her. For her, my ideal reaction would have been to rush over and ask if she was okay with a big look of concern on my face and babble on about how sorry I am that she fell and that I should have been there to catch her etc...

The entire time, I skied behind her in case she fell and gave her encouragement, told her she was doing a good job, etc... I let her borrow my face mask because she stubbornly came ill-prepared for cold weather because she didn't want to spend any money (even though she has plenty and works). I had to insist on snow pants at least so that she wouldn't ski in 25 degree snowing weather in jeans.

When we got back home on Sunday, she got a text from an ex that has a history with us and I asked her to please tell him to stop and/or ignore him. She uses this opportunity to freak out about how she doesn't feel loved and that I shouldn't have laughed at her on the ski run, and how I'm never being nice to her. Then I re-count how I picked up her skis when she fell, scraped the snow off of her boots and helped her get them back on, covered all of the expenses because she forgot her wallet (she is paying me back though), cuddle with her every night in bed and in the morning, bought snacks for the trip for both of us, told her how great she looked in her bikini when we went to the hot tub, etc... but it's like all she does is focus on the one minor negative thing I did, and then recount everything I've ever done in the course of our 2 year relationship that made her feel bad (all super minor things that she twists into negatives).

2- On a normal weekday, we both work 9-5 and carpool where I drop her off and then go to work. We usually listen to a comedy channel on the way down. Then when I pick her up we go home and make a quick meal or eat stuff that doesn't need to be cooked. We sit and watch tv or look at things online while we eat. Then we do a workout or start up a movie and watch it in bed and about every other day during the week we have sex, and every day on the weekends. Pretty normal I would say.

I do love her, but I feel like she is much more...forceful? with her constant I love you's and compliments. She will say I love you about 10 times a day. Compliments me at least 10 times a day on the weekends when we're together all day. I always say I love you back, but maybe only say it first like 1-2 times a day. I compliment her maybe 1-2 times a day.

I feel like she is just very needy with my attention and affection, which isn't the end of the world, but I'm trying to figure out how I can live a normal day-to-day life with her without feeling like I have to shower her with praises all the time, and be in 24/7 romance mode.

I want to make her happy, and it feels like compliments and whatever else she needs are a small thing, but it is also a draining/wearing thing where I have to be on high alert for things that I might say that will upset her, and whether I've given her enough compliments today to make her feel worth something.

We'd been together almost two years when things started to go a bit sour, not bad per se, but just a bit, normal. We weren't clicking on the same level. We decided to go on a break for a couple of weeks and see what happens. Long story short: I initially wanted to get back together, she convinced me breaking up was the right thing to do.

It got almost like we were married. Comfortable rather than happy. Seeing each other every day, but only for like 2 hours before falling asleep. Like I say though, not bad, just not actively good. That kind of thing. And I love her, but I'm not ready for that and neither is she. I myself need time to mature, by myself, and focus on what's best for me after uni.

But we still very much love each other. She's the most important part of my life and I can't be without her in some capacity. We decided to try and be friends but man that's the hardest shit. I just dunno what to do man. I feel, and think she feels it too, that we'll be back together at some point. But fuck me if that doesn't seem like so far away.

I guess I just don't know how to get through this. Never had this kind of break up before. I've tried talking to people, but none of them have ever really been through a serious breakup, or one where it's been like this. Is there anyone out there with a similar story? What happened? How did you get through it? Because right now I'm a mess.

Sorry. That was too much but y'know it just feels good to write it all down, don't mind if no one reads or responds. Just get this shit out of me.

TL;DR; Broke up with the girl I thought I'd be with forever. Both still love each other. Don't know what to do.

91,1lu4dg,"Background: We've been dating for just over a year. He just graduated in June and I've just begun my senior year. He is sticking around this year going to a local college. We love each other very much and were friends for about 3 years before we started dating. we were each other's firsts. I have a lot of insecurities in the relationship (for reasons unknown (i guess its just who i am)) but i always trusted that he wouldnt cheat on me and that he would be very open and honest with me.

Two weeks ago: So i was at home doing nothing and he (lets call him D) was out biking with two male friends. D and i have the same group of friends and have talked in the past about how I would like to be invited to hangout with these friends unless it was just a guy thing. The reason i want to be there is because i dont have a lot of other friends other than the ones D and i hang around with. Im always polite when im around them and get along with most of them. So anyways. this bike ride was a guy thing so there was no issue there. Later D texts me that they are going to pick up a girl from her house. Now, this girl in particular is one that D used to have a thing for.( he never acted on his feelings for her). she is always very flirty with him so D knows i dont like him hanging around her especially because he isnt clear on boundaries with his girl friends. He would never tell one of them when they are crossing a line. So after D told me they were picking her up i hinted that i wanted to come to. What he said next hurt me a lot, You wouldn't feel right with this group. This is a group of people that i have seen at school everyday and hung out with so many times over the past few years! Hearing that id feel uncomfortable hurt me a lot. I didnt text him back for the rest of that night because i was upset and confused as to why he didnt want me there. We had a huge argument over the next few days because he thought i was angry with him for hanging out with his friends. I was mostly just angry that he didnt want me there. One of the many reasons i love dating him is that we get along with and can hang out with each other's friends. I don't want that to change. He thouht that i didnt trust him to be around this other girl. I definitely do trust him but it still makes me uncomfortable. we talked through this all eventually and kind of left it alone and went back to normal.

A week ago: D and i were at a party and a girl we know (we'll call her E) was there too. i was talking to some friends and D was about a meter away talking with another group. E came up and started talking to him. Later on D told me that E came up and said something like, can i hug you or will your girlfriend get mad? then someone else in the group jokes and says, I think she's already mad. E proceeds to say, What else is new. and rolls her eyes. I found this disrespectful as well. For the rest of the night E is all up in D's face when she talks to him. almost kissing distance away. I could tell she was being flirty. She kept begging him to get drunk with her and he kept politely refusing. so this is basically an example of him not setting boundaries. I have asked him to talk with this girl and set her straight.

Yesterday: We were in A&amp;W and i asked to see his phone because i wanted to see if he talked to E after id asked him. He said sure. He never hides his phone from me, nor I him. So he's about to hand me his phone and then hesitates and start blurting out about some girls he's been talking with. He clearly only told me right before he gave me the phone because he thought i would see and that id be upset. Im insecure but im not that crazy that he cant text girls! so anyways i take his phone and am scrolling through him and E's messages and he is watching me do it. Nothing out of the usual at all but then i scroll a bit more and D swipes the phone out of my hands saying thats enough. I ask him what it is that he didnt want me to see. He said the night that i was upset about being discluded from the bike ride he texted E You missed out on a great time. So E was invited too!!! Apparently they were at E's house for about half an hour and he conveniently left that out of the story because he thought id be upset. I wouldnt have been upset at all!!!!! the only thing i was sad about that night was him excluding me. And now i am sad that he has kept it from me. so we basically argued all day and i told him he has to tell me everything else he's kept from me. Apparently, while i was on a family trip last weekend and he was with his friend (like he said) they were also with a bunch of girls and a few boys. He kept that from me too. I would not have been angry at all! But now im suspicious that something may have gone down that night and thats why he didnt tell me.

So Now: I am so confused on what to do. I dont know if breaking up is the right thing to do. I know these arent big things that he kept from me but it still hurts that he cant communicate with me because he thinks ill be mad. And Him keeping little things from me could definitely progress into big things. I dont trust him anymore.Help, reddit? Am i a crazy bitch? Is he the one for me? also sorry this is so long:(

The only problem I find is that it can be really difficult to talk or start conversations with Beth, and even to just maintain them, because she almost always maintains a sarcastic, cynical front which she uses to address absolutely everyone.

This ranges from sarcastic comments to straight up put-downs, and even though they're done in jest, it's sorta difficult to get past them and defuse the situation to any satisfactory level.

968,2sthsd,"Me and this guy met and started dating in college and really became best friends fast. Sometimes he would talk about the future between us but would always preface things with I know we probably won't get married or We probably aren't going to end up together forever and at the time those statements confused me by that but it definitely made me more distant from him. 

Whenever we had serious talks I would always go more in the direction of a serious relationship when he seemed less wanting to be considered as a boyfriend. Eventually I got tired and didn't want to push him into anything he didn't want to do. It was weird because we acted like we were in a relationship but he never wanted to go further. This went on for 6-7 months and by then we had established ourselves as a nonexclusive relationship. 

I really thought the guy I dated kept refusing to be my boyfriend for a good reason (like he wasn't really into me or just wanted to feel companionship). One night, I ended up hooking up with this other guy I had liked for a while (but I had no intention of dating), and it went on for about a week or so. I just kind of wanted to get him out of my system (but obviously hooking up with him wasn't the answer). 

Around a month later he told me that if I hooked up with someone else he would be pissed, so I ended up telling the truth the next day (because I'm terrible at keeping secrets). He got incredibly mad and told me that he had really liked me and that he never cheated on me himself.

Eventually he took me back a week later and things were a little awkward especially when he would remind me that he gave me a really big second chance, and would ask about details like what was in your mind when you walked over, why would you risk our relationship (at this point I felt compelled to say WHAT RELATIONSHIP?). He told me he wanted me to better myself (I told him about my depression occasionally, which I have never told anyone else about). 

I really felt awful about it when I considered it from his perspective since he really did like me so I wanted to treat him better and give him the attention I thought he deserved. I also made real efforts to a healthier mindset in efforts to better myself in efforts to redeem myself or something. Maybe it was partly out of guilt but eventually I had come to really like him and actually became really happy and we really did get along well.

A few months later when I was overseas for winter break, he suddenly sent me a stream of facebook messages about how he wasn't feeling sure about the relationship, and that he had a panic attack because he was so worried about me. He told me that he didn't really know who I was. I feel like I did nothing to make him feel worried or anxious (lived at home, only ever left for school or to see him). It really stung because I had tried to tell him everything about me, and that it meant nothing to him and that he still saw me as a stranger.

I guess I realized by that time it didn't matter how much I could give him, that he would never come to trust me again (and again felt awful that I caused him a panic attack). He told me that we should talk after winter break and I bottled my emotions for 2 weeks waiting and it was terrible.

When I went back to the states I texted him instantly that I had just landed and I was ready to talk to him when he wanted to. A day later he sent incredibly nasty messages like that I had fucked up and that I wasn't his problem to deal with, and that I should just go fuck my other boyfriends (which I obviously had none). He told me I shouldn't have ever cheated on me if I had wanted a serious relationship.

I'm heartbroken and I can't help but blame myself for everything that's happened, but I feel like he abandoned all responsibilities and that his response was excessively rude and immature. I'm aware that we are both still new to relationships and things could have been handled differently. Honestly I still want to be his friend because he really does mean a lot to me. Anyways, should I feel most of the blame in this situation? Did he really give me a second chance?

I have been seeing this girl for about 3 weeks and we have very recently become exclusive. Everything has been going super well. I've never hit it off with someone so great from the start. She has told me the same thing as she's said that she loses interest in a guy after becoming intimate (as we did during one of the first times we hung out). I can relate to this by the way. I also didn't lose interest and we've continued to hang out. It was even her idea to recently become exclusive. A little background on me: By choice, I haven't had a relationship in 5 years. At first, it was just wanting to be single (college), and then I was kinda open to it and it just wasn't working out with the girls I was meeting. I had some relationships that were definitely beyond physical and which I was emotionally invested in, but none of them prompted an actual relationship where both people shared mutual feelings. Then, I met this girl.

Now, her and I have exchanged plenty of stories to each other regarding our past relationships and sexual escapades. We communicate well and comfortable with each other. I have never considered myself to be someone who has had a low amount of sexual partners, not at all. I know this girl for sure has had more than me; I don't know how much more, but enough for her to playfully teas and say my number was conservative. I have had 7 sexual partners. Her and I haven't had sex yet, everything but sex for now. It bothered me a little to hear about her sex stories at first, but I do totally get it. I'm totally open, comfortable about sex. It's all good. I shared my stories as well.  


She has dated more people than me as well, which maybe isn't saying much, I dunno. I do acknowledge that there may be plenty of people who may have dated more people than I have in the last 5 years. Overall though, we communicate really well and I know we're both really into each other. Everything is great, still new and exciting, but great. 


Here's my dilemma: She's very affectionate when we're together, which I really enjoy because I am too. Little kisses, cuddling, hand holding, putting her legs on top of mine, etc.. But, I keep coming back to the same questions:


Is she like this with every guy she dates because she is an innately affectionate person?
Am I any different?
Is this just me not getting how a new relationship works because I haven't had an SO in awhile?
How do you deal with someone who maybe is innately affectionate and has had more sexual/relationship experience?


Surely, as the months go on if we're still together, I'm bound to feel more comfortable. Personally, I don't care what a person's history is as long as the current feelings are present, genuine, mutual. Could anyone shed light on any of this? I feel like there might be others who have been in similar positions.

tl;dr dating a new girl who has dated and had sex with more people than me, wondering how to deal with it and if it's just my lack of experience or something else that  I'm not understanding.

It's also impossible to escape her, I see pictures on facebook because I'm friends with some of her friends, I see her in the halls, they guy she hooked up with is the teachers pet in my history class, I see her after school because we both have cross country. I also feel bipolar, some moments I want to get back together, other times the idea of even thinking about her makes my blood boil, and I feel like punching the shit out of an object that I know will hurt. 
Some nights I get high and listen to dark side of the moon, which makes me not think of her. She is talking to this one new kid now and I hate seeing her do that.

It feels so injust too, she just breaks up and is now enjoying herself so much more it feels like, yet I was a loyal good boyfriend who did a lot for her. It also doesnt even seem like she is upset about it all. I also want to yell at her in person and tell her all the pain she has put me through but that cant happen otherwise she would act like im crazy or something.
I feel like I dont deserve to feel like this or be treated like this, it feels so injust and it pisses me off. Sometimes I hate the fact I even think about being back together with her.

My good friend of about 2 years,(Lesley), had liked her ex,(cappuccino), since middle school. They finally got together in November and dated for about two months. She broke up with Cappuccino because he said he loved her when he didn't and the relationship wasn't balanced. 

This was completely reasonable. I totally agreed with her. She of course, wanted nothing to do with him. She made me promise not to speak to him. This was easy at first, we didn't have classes together and were only sort of connected through our my mutual friends.

She began talking shit about him. This was fine, even expected. It has been around a month now though and she still has yet to calm down about it. She still will tell me his secrets and will try to ruin his day whenever she can. 

I would have been fine ignoring this fact, except this week is production week at our school. We are theater technicians and Cappuccino is one as well. 

Cappuccino and Lesley have to work in the booth together. This causes her a lot of mental stress, again understandable. However, if I so much as talked to him she would say things like, could you stop flirting with my ex in front of me

This bothers me. Cappuccino is a very nice guy and we get along really well.  My boyfriend is super close with him, so we are good friends.

Now, I am not one to willfully do someone else harm, but I did not think that I was doing anything wrong. She is expecting me to lose a good friend over her bitterness. I don't understand why she would want to make me choose. It is unfair to both of us.

It all started in summer. He had some serious problems in his life at that moment. At first, I was supportive but then I had a breakdown myself. I was tired of being with him all the time and I told him that. He was very hurt and afterwards our relationship got a bit colder. He started talking how he doesn't trust me anymore. He occasionally blamed me for leaving him alone.

About two months ago he had a breakdown. He wrote me a very long message about how he feels (not about our relationship). I saw that message in the morning and I replied to him. However, I couldn't write him for a few hours, so he was really mad at me because he thought that I'm being all unsupportive again. He thought that I was running away from his problems. He carried on with blaming me for being bad again. I apologised every time he mentioned this.


After this time, everything went even worse. We're fighting a lot. He even suggested to break-up. It was the first time that we talked about it. I told him that I won't leave him. A day after that he said he was sorry and did it from anger. 

Then he had a rough time once again. He asked me to be nice and very supportive for two weeks or so. I was very easily irritated but I tried my best to be good for him after that. Then, one day, for a minute I lost my temper. It was very mild, not about him. He was very disappointed because I didn't keep my promise to be gentle with him.

This happened like a two weeks ago. Everything's going downhill from that time. He says that I can't be supportive, that I'm naturally cold but I don't think that I am. I tried to do my best but it's my first relationship and I've made a lot of mistakes. Now he's being very cold. I don't even know if he wants to be with me. Yesterday I asked him that. He told me that he wants. All two weeks I've been trying to be very sweet, caring, supportive. I'm trying to make him communicate with me but it seems like it's just irritating him. Yesterday he was extremely dull, so after many attempts to cheer him up, I just told him that I will just go away. I hoped that he will write me the next day. Well, it's almost night and he still didn't write to me. It happens on really rare occasions.

Yet, he's always telling me about how he went to breakfast, lunch, dinner with his brother &amp; brother's GF, best friend &amp; best friend's GF, etc. Not ONCE has he invited me to join them. I'm not asking to be attached at the hip (because I have a life as well) BUT I *would* like to know that he wants me around for something other than sex &amp; it that he's not embarrassed of me. It sucks to constantly feel like an afterthought. Little things make me feel like he takes me for granted...for example, telling me he'd try his hardest to meet up then he never calls me but sends a mass snapchat while he's out with his friend's and their GFs.

He'll say to me I really like you, I like you a lot but not once has he said he loves me. We've known each other for 8+ years, I know I'm in love with him...don't you think at this point he would know if he actually wants to be with me/loves me? For the record, I have NOT told him that. I'm just afraid that he's settling for me &amp; when he finds someone better he'll be gone. I know that I shouldn't compare our relationship to anyone else's but when I hear people that have less history or time invested than we do talking about how madly in love they are I feel a twinge of jealousy &amp; heartbreak.


Conversely, maybe it's my fault. It took me a while to be okay with affection in public/sharing my feelings (been hurt before, so I shut down for a while, blah blah sob story). I tend to play it cool a lot &amp; haven't told him that these things bother me so maybe he's just not aware that it hurts my feelings. I just want reassurance that he loves me &amp; sees a future with me, that I'm not wasting my time being someone's convenient booty call GF. How do I bring this up to him? Should I? Or am I being a total idiot?

697,3dbonb,"First time im posting here, I tend to be a suffer in silence kind of person but I've been told I need to voice my problems and it's okay to ask for help, so I made a new account for this because I feel better about doing this anonymously. So I've known this girl, let's call her A, for about two years, we met in high school and we hung out in the same group of friends so we ended up becoming good friends. For about five years previously I was in a relationship with this girl, let's call her B, and it was an abusive and manipulative relationship but I stayed with her because she threatened to kill herself if I ever left her. In the last few months of the relationship I started pulling back from everything, I was extremely depressed and didn't really want to do anything. At that time I did end up growing closer to A, we talked more, we hung out a bit. She talked to me for those few months about my relationship and how unhealthy it was for me to be in it. I kind of fell in love with her through it all but I was still with B. A little back story on B. She has a bit of a reputation, a lot of relationships and stuff dating back from when she was 12, some dark stuff in there. Her first real boyfriend that she absolutely loved commited suicide and she's been scared to put all of her love in one person so she calls herself polyamorous and doesn't stay with one person for too long relationship wise. Just need to know that she has a bunch of guy friends that she's very close to. I finally got the courage to break up with B one night after a dinner with A, and when I went to Skype her she accidentally picked up on her computer and she was having sex with her friend I'm gonna name F. After this happened I went back to being a recluse, I didn't talk to anyone for a while. B was my first girlfriend and I had been with her for five years, being alone was new to me and I really couldn't handle it. So a few weeks later I finally got in contact with A, we started hanging out again, and at some point we started going out. I really do like A, but the problem is she is never there, I can almost never get in touch with her and because I'm still in school and in the process of moving I never get to see her. Also my parents hate her because she's actually very similar to my mother which I've already gotten therapy for because she unintentionally fucked me up emotionally, and the fact that it's really close to the ending of a long term relationship which puts stress on us as is. The main problem that I have is my insomnia that keeps me awake, and she doesn't stay awake that long so I'm left worrying. I forgot to mention earlier that the time A slept with F she told me that she was going right to bed when she got home because it was late, and I was fine with that but a little later in the night I noticed she popped online for Skype so I called and that happened. So every time that she tells me she's going to bed I'm extremely paranoid that she's with someone else. All of her friends I talked to before I asked her out told me to be careful and to be sure I knew what I was getting into. She also has been getting really close with this older married couple who are also polyamorous and are looking for a replacement for their girlfriend who just went off to college and while A says she isn't like that with them, she spends a lot of time with them and it worries n.a. I really do want to be monogamous with her and I know she's trying hard to do that for me too but it's so terrifying knowing her past, coupled with self consciousness issues on my part and th factor that I still talk to B because I feel like her mental health is my fault and helping her adjust to being single without her killing herself is my responsibility. So yeah... Long post, I kind of mention every major issue I need advice on but I realise some of them might not look like big problems because I typed them somewhat nonchalant so I'll recap them in the tl;dr.

tl;dr 
Left a Long term abusive relationship for a girl that I fell in love with that is considered a slut who is polyamorous, I have trust issues, paranoia, insomnia, and depression which makes it really hard to be in an exclusive relationship with this girl who still keeps in very close contact with a lot of her guy friends and has abandoned me to help them. Other things that put stress on the relationship are my parents, the amount of time we can talk to each other a day, and the fact that I still am in contact with my ex because I'm worried she's gonna kill herself and I would feel extremely guilty if she did.

We went into one of these a couple of days after starting up.  Things between us became quite intimate and the boom she was at work all the time.  The first couple of days or so we exchanged texts but after that she initiates no contact.  And her messages seem quite curt and dismissive.  She has me doing things to help during this busy time, I offered to help, like walking her dog and sending wake up texts.  Otherwise I get the very strong sense that her interest is waning and I am being played for a sucker.

I brought this up a couple of times and this finally culminated in a this isn't working for me style semi-break up text initiated by me.  She has reassured me that she is just very busy, but I'm not so sure.  She still manages to go out for drinks with co-workers after work and I can't understand how someone can't send a quick text every now and then.  Early on in relationships, people are usually willing to move heaven and earth to stay in touch, and I'm just not feeling it.

My questions, is am I being too demanding to expect some effort towards communication at this point.  Conversations are very intimate when we are together.  Her mouth speaks one thing, her actions seem to speak another.

284,1w63l2,"I've been dating this girl for 9-10 months and this is my first actual relationship. I don't have anyone to talk to about my relationship problems without sounding whiny and emotional. Anyway I would say our relationship is pretty average, I like spending time with her and we have similar interests. I'm not wanting it to be perfect since we are only teenagers so issues can be expected I guess. Now where to begin... Today I texted her asking if she wanted to go to dinner with my family and I tonight. I figured she might be taking a nap so I called her. She picked up and said she was sleeping, but that it was alright. I asked her if she wanted to go to dinner and her first response was I wanted to watch the game. Ok, so I asked what time it was at. She said 7. It was about 5:30 at the time. 

Ok so does that mean you don't want to hang out? I asked.

We could watch the game together. she said.

Now granted, I'm a sports fan, but she happens to be from another state and likes a different team. It's not that I don't like the team, it's just that I don't care to watch them play, it's not interesting to me. Plus, we've tried to do that before and it was extremely boring for me and it made me not want to do it again. At this point I told her I didn't want to watch the game and she said ok, so I took this as a sign that we were not doing anything tonight. Whatever, I went to dinner and did nothing for the rest of the night. A little background on my girlfriend: she comes from a very narcissistic family. Her mother became pregnant in college with her much older [29] brother and now tries to project her life onto my girlfriend. They don't have a very good relationship, and it affects our relationship, which sucks, a lot. Last night we had plans to eat dinner at her house and then go see a movie. Well the time comes and about 20 minutes before we were about to leave her mom asks when we are going. Turns out she never cleared the times out with her mom and they argue about when she's going to be home. She has a very strict curfew (12 o'clock) which can sometimes be a problem if she gets home even minutes late. So they argue about how she is pushing it by risking being back a few minutes late from the movies, when in reality it could have worked out fine. Nonetheless, her skills with dealing with her parents are not very good, and she says I wanted to tell the truth. So now we aren't going out. I was upset because I was excited to finally take her out after a while of just staying home and now it was shot because of her and her mom. This is a very common theme in our relationship, and it causes lots of arguments. I just don't know how to deal with a girl who seems to come packaged with controlling parents. Tonight I was really mad and told her off, saying that she picked sports over me and that I was done texting her tonight. I feel awful about it and I know I will have to apologize in the morning, but it happens all too often. This seems like such a ramble but I really don't have anyone else to tell it to.

My husband cheated and left to be with the OW who is also married with a kid and supposedly leaving her husband (who she kicked out) as well. I found out some disturbing (IMO) news that I think her husband deserves to know since it might benefit him in a custody battle but I'm not sure if this is something I should leave alone or pursue. 


 Apparently she was letting my husband sleep in the bed with her and her kid and while I don't think he's capable of hurting a child, it doesn't seem fair to keep this from the child's father because letting a stranger get in bed with a kid would really outrage me if I was a parent. Especially if there's a chance they had sex in the bed or room when the kid was in there. If there is the slightest chance it doesn't work out between her and my husband I hate to think who else she might let sleep in a bed with her kid. She is also trying to completely kick her husband out of her child's life which I find even more alarming given her behavior. Without any ammo in court he may not be able to protect his kid if he doesn't have much custody.


I know the best course of action is to talk to my lawyer first (and I probably will) but I wanted to know is it even worth it? It might cost me a lot of money to drag this into court so should I just leave it alone since it essentially is not my business or do I try to help the guy out?

Edit 2: I didn't expect so many answers since I post it late at night. I'd like to add that initially I really thought this wasn't my concern but a lot of friends and my sister were completely repulsed and have worked this into an issue so I started to feel like I'm supposed to do something about it. Am I spiteful? Yes. However, I'm not so spiteful that I want to haul people into court for something that's not in anyways going to benefit me. I know this will not make them break up, it will probably do the opposite and I also know she would still retain some custody but this was blown out of proportion and turned into a huge deal by people in my own life and now I'm confused about whether or not I'm supposed to do something or not.

Being young and dumb, we cheated on our significant others with one another, having mind blowing sex often. Over the years we have spent varying amounts of time being an item but never anything official and always dating others. 

We've watched each other grow through college, careers, and family issues. Basically, we know each other extremely well and have a massive sexual chemistry. We now spend most of our time singing karaoke and eating. 

However, he is crazy. And I mean possibly legitimately mentally ill. His temper is off the charts, any small thing will cause him to punch stuff, curse, yell at people and also be self hating and self destructive. He will force himself to do things he knows he doesn't want to do, then he will literally cry or fight with someone about it, or take his frustration out on inanimate objects. 

The weather is always bad, the cab is too slow, the food is too expensive, he's too tired, the bed is too soft for sex, he can't get hard because he's drunk, his co workers are being difficult... Basically NOTHING is ever right. He is never happy. He never genuinely laughs. He's a miserable, grouchy, unhappy person, even though he has family, friends, a great job as a tv producer, and of course me.

Lately I have felt my feelings for him grow as I am approaching thirty and thinking of the future. I realize how much we have in common, how well we know each other and how much fun (I thought) we have together. 

But he travels for work and in general he's just not a nice person, so a true relationship is out of the question. I tried and tried to prove to him that I am loyal and I will wait for him to be ready (in the past I had shunned the idea of committing to him which left him a bit scarred). 

This valentines day I went crazy coming up with a beautiful gift with custom wrapping paper and a special card and a whole night plan and what ended up happening was a midnight dinner (he spent most of the night unable to move because he was extremely exhausted and he knew I couldn't possibly understand because all I ever did was waitress or sit at a desk) where he told me he knows everything I say and do is fake, and that he knows I'm truly a bad person and that he knows the real, selfish me. 

I stormed out and blocked him from ever contacting me again. I felt we had both suffered enough and clearly the emotional abuse was out of hand.

Here comes the good part: last night, a mutual friend told him where my date and I were. He showed up with flowers and a card and my date was understandably pissed, and he stormed out. (Only to return later and find me talking to R, and get even more angry). I feel like I am being punished or blamed and I don't know what to do. I want to be angry at my date for abandoning me (we met four months ago and finally started dating just after valentines day when I blocked R) and I'm angry at R for coming back into my life and ignoring all the damage he has caused.

I ended to going home with R and having very drunken sex, after he cried hysterically and shouted at me for having been with another man after I removed him from my life. However, I actually really like this new guy, L. He is mature, funny, has a great job, and seems to like me a lot. He also asked me to come to his house for dinner tonight, even after the scene from last night.

This all came to a head yesterday. Someone in his family recently gave birth and we talked about going to visit. I said I wasn't sure if I could go but will keep him posted throughout the day. 3 p.m rolls around and I msg him saying, hey when are we leaving, what are we bringing etc. He responds and then says, oh btw James is coming lol.

First I was confused and then I was really pissed off. James is his best friend of 10 years. I have no problems with any of his friends but (and we've had this fight before) whenever it is the 3 of us hanging out my boyfriend will show 0 affection. We can't hold hands, can't peck, can't snuggle for too long or even have inside jokes. He says he feels bad because James has never had a girlfriend and has really low self esteem so he doesn't want to rub our relationship in his face. We argued for a bit but he wasn't getting why I so upset so I just stopped responding.

To keep this story short, I didn't end up going to see the baby because I feel like we keep having the same argument that is centred around my boyfriend not treating me differently than his friends (if that makes sense). I just feel like there are some life milestones or whatever that you should share with your partner and those things should be special. 

I guess my question is, would anyone else be upset? 

EDIT #1 I really didn't explain myself properly. I'm not upset about the dynamic with James, it's annoying but I deal with it. I'm upset because my boyfriend asked James to go see a newborn. I just think that's really weird. Also my anger is coming from the fact that my boyfriend can't differentiate between what you should do with your partner vs what you should do with your friends.

She seemed pretty cool and we ended up dancing together for a while until she had to leave. Before she left she added me on Facebook (should have asked for her number instead, I know, but whatever) so we could keep in touch.

So my first question is pretty basic: what next? Should I just bite the bullet and ask her out for lunch or something next weekend, or spend more time chatting to her first?

The second question is somewhat more important: is it likely to work at all? I moved away when I graduated and now live 1.5 hours away, which makes mid-week dates a bit harder. I'm also not sure whether she plans to return to her home country when her research project ends or if it's a permanent position.

610,1xc98q,"My fiancé seems to have no problems with the idea of me cheating on him, no matter the circumstance, and it bothers me because if he cheated on me I'd be devastated, and I sort of expected him to feel the same. He's said multiple times that he would forgive me on the spot if I ever cheated and that he would trust me no matter what, as soon as I apologized.

Earlier today we got on the topic of infidelity when we were watching a TV show about people who were unable to have frequent sex due to medical issues, and he said that if we ever ended up in that situation, he'd be okay if I cheated as long as I still came home to him every night. I told him that I found the idea of stepping out on him while still coming home to him at night disgusting, and that I'd be disgusted with myself for doing it. I think it would be an incredibly selfish thing to do, especially in the event he was having medical issues. He responded with saying he'd fully expect it and wouldn't be surprised if I did.

His nonchalant attitude on the subject kind of makes me worried about his own morals in regards to fidelity. If I ever have a medical problem that prevents us from having sex regularly, his first thought seems to be to step outside the marriage to fulfill those needs. He's never been cheated on before (to his knowledge), while I have, so maybe this is why he feels he would be so unaffected by it.

The whole thing just bothers me, but he doesn't seem to find anything wrong with it, and to be honest a part of me is a little hurt by the fact he wouldn't care if I cheated on him. To the married men of reddit, what do you think of this? Wouldn't you find your wife repulsive if she did the above? Maybe I'm reading too far into this, but I'm a little worried that this could be a red flag for someone who could eventually ask for an open marriage, which is something I know I never want to do. I would never be able to give him this without destroying the love I have for him.

 Me(37M) and my wife (33F) are at a crossroads in our marriage and our lives. As of this past June 15th it was our 18 years together and as of August we have been married for 8 years. Since 1996... 

 My wife is in a career which has her traveling (sales position ) up to 6 times a year, usually not longer than a week. She is wined and dined by salesmen and customers and that's just a little bit of the apprehension I feel about it. We have been close but there is definitely something else in the room, figuratively speaking.

The thing that grinds me up is that we have two young daughters that miss her everyday she is gone...and she doesn't respond to texts or calls ALL DAY. maybe if I'm lucky I receive a quick  gnight love u &lt;3  way past the girls' bed time. When she does get back she seems distant... Like I cannot provide that lifestyle (I can't I'm a warehouse guy with a 9-5 job busting my ass ) and its intimidating to say the least.

Now am I just being male and insecure, or is it normal to be angry at being placed in second to her career? I'm Mr. Mom and I'm not complaining about that at all...its just clear to me she wants that instead of this. Is she cheating on me? My mind is racked.

676,1j1m9a,"Good afternoon all. I'm reaching a point in my life where decisions on marriage are soon to be made and I'm having second thoughts.

My SO and I are both turning 30 over the next 12 months. We've been together for 6 years, living together for 3. Over the past 3 years we both have settled into careers in our goal industries, so we're both quite happy on the work-front. We're quite happy on the relationship-front too, and starting to think about marriage now that we're financially stable and a little older. 

There's just one issue (and I do mean just one issue, because in all other ways our relationship is wonderful): he works very long hours. This will not go away. This is the career and industry he has chosen, and it is known for its long hours. I'm not sure if I want to sign up for a life of having a part-time relationship. It very much feels like a part-time relationship right now.

I do have many hobbies and organizations that I am a part of. I keep myself busy with things that I am generally interested in and enjoy doing. But still, 5 nights out of the week I come home to an empty home and don't see my SO until he gets home around 9:00pm. We both go to bed around 11:00pm, and honestly I do better going to bed at 10:00pm but stay up later to spend time with him. I don't think this is the life I want. I want to come home and see my SO and cook dinner together and just live our lives together. We get this on weekends and on a weeknight every once in a while, but now thinking about life-long commitments I'm just not sure that is enough.

However, what is the alternative of a part-time relationship with him? No relationship with him at all. Seeing him never as opposed to not enough. That is the opposite of what I want! So breaking up seems like the worst possible outcome. Being in a part-time relationship with him is better than not being with him at all. 

But then again, I hate coming home to an empty house. I don't want a marriage like that. I'm in a circular thought-process prison and don't know what to do.

**TL;DR:** Relationship with SO is wonderful in all ways except that he works long hours and I only see him for an hour or two before bed and on weekends - we don't get to have dinner together or spend time together on weeknights. Do I want a life of this? But a life without him sounds worse.

566,1ktu9o,"So the question is: How do I work through anxieties around conflict to communicate better? What am I supposed to do when I'm prompted to talk but my mind is blank and I have literally nothing to say? Is there some sort of step by step process to demonstrate to some one that I understand them?


Background: My husband and I have been married a little over a year and been together a little over four. Brief mental history background: I've been diagnosed with a generalized anxiety disorder and he has been diagnosed with depression. Both of us are on medication for it and it is reasonably controlled. He has a tendency to feel like he has no direction in life and what's the point? and I tend to enter a panic mode with conflict.


One of our major sources of conflict are our communication as well as love language styles. He is a super communicator, where it is a lot harder for me to do so. He wants to talk about everything and sometimes I feel like he is lecturing me. He feels like I don't talk or share enough. I, admittedly, have a hard time sharing sometimes.


Being understood is *very* important for him and if he doesn't feel understood he feels increasingly frustrated and annoyed. The beginning of our relationship was unfortunately wrought with a good bit of yelling (from him) and tears (from me) when these situations arose.


At this point, I've spent four years being told in every single argument about how I don't understand him. How it's so important for him to be understood. That he just needs me to understand him. When I ask how to demonstrate to him that I understand he gives very little direction other than just talk to me. My attempts to talk to him often end up being misguided which result in him getting increasingly frustrated, me getting defensive and feeling anxious and hopeless. At some point, it's very, very hard not to feel like I'm just not good enough for him and then I end up lashing out. This is usually exasperated by the fact that these arguments happen late at night and I tend to be more anxious and not so great at talking emotions past about 10. I try to ask if we can just talk about it the next day and then he says that I never want to talk about it (not true) and that we won't talk about it in the morning and we never do (we never do because we always keep talking about it at night).


When we're not in a conflict situation we have talked about this. He understands that it's hard for me and that I'm trying and that he's not giving me any direction. He understands that it's hard for me at night and that fighting after 10 isn't a good idea and it's better to shelve it and come to it at a different time. When the conflict comes up, he feels like he needs to feel understood and that me wanting to shelve it is demonstration that I don't care.


I just don't know what to do. My schedule is changing some in the next year and he has been telling me for two or so weeks that I need to cut back on my activities so I don't get too anxious. I told him today that I don't really think I need to cut back as much as he thinks I do and I feel like he's trying to control my actions. He was less than pleased and keeps going on and on about how I don't understand him and he just wants to be understood. I am interpreting that to mean that he wants me to agree with him and the fact that I don't is frustrating him, but he assures me that he just wants to talk about it and that he's mad that I've had two weeks and I haven't brought these concerns to him. When I asked how I can demonstrate to him that I understand him he says to talk to him, but me talking to him and telling what I think hasn't changed anything.


I just don't know what to do. I *know* that I can be better at communicating, but I have so much anxiety and fear around conflict that it makes it difficult. I feel like my attempts to communicate in the past have just led to frustration and more anxiety because (I feel like) I'm not doing it in a way that works for him and then I feel like I'm hitting my head against a wall trying to make him feel understood.


Apparently (I asked), there are plenty of other people in his life with whom he has not had this problem, so I apparently am just missing the boat somewhere. The thing is, it's not like I don't have emotional intelligence. I'm a very empathetic, friendly person, but I seem to suck at conflict. I have tried to say I understand That makes sense… et c. I have tried to explain back to him what I think he's saying. Even when I do that, though, he gets upset because he says that it's like I'm just trying to find a quick fix and that he wants me to talk to him. When I ask what he wants to talk about, he says he wants a conversation. It seems though that that conversation is supposed to be led by me and at that point, I'm usually still freaking out internally and really have nothing to say. Even if I'm thinking about something, it's usually not accessible enough for me to be able to communicate it.


tl, dr: My husband wants to be understood and gets frustrated when he doesn't feel understood, but gives me very little direction on how I'm supposed to demonstrate understanding. Conflict freaks me out and it's hard to communicate when my mind is blank.

I'm in college, very new to dating, and just got in a relationship with someone of the same background as me. We're both virgins, but are still experienced with pretty much everything else in the typical college hookup culture. 

So, I've always heard how guys hate when girls tease them and leave them with blue balls --as in, leaving them unsatisfied and/or not finishing them during a hookup session. When my boyfriend and I first started hooking up, it was completely that -- it was a once a week thing, and since we were both not ready to have sex, I would be fine with giving him oral and finishing him that way, every time we hooked up. That said, now we're together more, and that's not what I always want to do -- sometimes I just want to make out/kiss, and yes, even though that can get heated, I'm not always in the mood for oral or a handjob every single time we're together physically. That said, when we are together and I'm not moving towards giving him oral, he always guides my hand lower indicating that he wants me to finish him off, when really all I'm in the mood for is a make out. He seems disappointed afterwards, which upsets me. Is it bad of me to not want to finish him off? Am I being a tease my initiating a make out and not wanting to go any further? He's ready for sex and I'm not, so I already feel like I'm not giving him what he wants. I'm okay with giving oral, and most of the time I do, I'm just not down to 100% of the time. I've talked to him and explained my feelings, and he doesn't push it further, but I was just wondering if this was normal, and how to handle it or talk about it with him further. Thanks!

His girlfriend goes to school about 5 hours away from his family's place, still across the country from where we go to school and lives on the other side of the planet. They've been LDRing for a year now- they had met at his old job, which had a lot of people from across the world. 

She hasn't taken well to him being out here with me, put simply. Over the past year, she's tried to give him a curfew/limit how much we hang out; got angry with him for going on bike rides/hiking trips/other adventures with me; facebook stalked me and freaked out that I had posted pictures of me and him; got on HIS facebook to read our messages (for some reason, we've never really texted, just constant facebook messaging) and gotten mad that he liked some of my pictures; refused to acknowledge when he tried to break up with her 3 times, and guilted/bullied him into staying; stopped talking to him for 3 days because she found out I was in his room.

He and I are super close- constant talking, hung out just about every free moment we had together. I basically lived at his place from summer until he left for home last week. Admittedly, we were probably closer than we should have been, and I can understand her suspicion to a level, though not her reactions. She had no idea we spent so much time together- after the first freakout when she found out we were hanging out alone at my place playing video games, he thought it best to not let her know how much time we were spending together, which led to a lot of shit she's skyping me and has called four times, I suppose I should answer it, mind chilling in the living room a bit?, which was sketchy.

I expected some dropoff when he went back home, since he was picking her up from the airport and she was staying with him for the rest of summer (had been in her home country for the first part while he was out here taking a summer class). The first few days he was gone and hadn't picked her up yet, he called 3-4 times a day and skyped, constantly chatted, and was generally prety mushy (I miss you, miss doing this with you, look I caught a firefly for you I know you haven't seen one, can't wait to get back, etc). He drove to get her from the airport, called on the way, but as soon as he got there went dark. For the past three days it's been very little contact. No calls (she's spectating), no skype, texts in very short bursts. I totally understand and expected that we wouldn't be able to talk as much or just hang out over skype, but didn't expect this dropoff. He's also been pretty plain and short when he has texted. 

I'm not sure if I'm being too clingy/needy? Probably am, I suppose he and I both got a bit too attached. I should give him his space. I'm just worried- he promised that while he was up there he would still keep in touch and that nothing would change, no matter what she tries to do. I trust him on that, though that's kinda fading a little bit, but I know I mean an awful lot to him and wouldn't say that if he didn't mean it. He even told a mutual friend that he has no idea what his relationship status with this girl was going to be when he picked her up. I guess I'm a little hurt, not sure if it's justified or not but it's there.

Mutual friend wants me to call him out on it, she's been pushing for the two of them to break up for half a year now (though, she's also been wanting me and him to get together, sooo). I haven't said much about it. On top of that, he found out he got a position as interim professor at a university not far from his family's house, so he'll be up there a year (she'll be still at school five hours away), and I don't know what to do if this lasts a whole year. He's coming back afterwards, moving in with me (we were supposed to live together with a few others this year, but he left our house since the job), etc in a year. Dunno if I should be encouraging him to break up with her, how to maintain a long distance thing like this, how to deal with missing him, or even what to think about the control freak girlfriend who has taken to sending me passive-aggressive sounding and frankly manipulative messages.

This dude means an awful lot to me, we've been there for eachother through a lot of hard times and great times, have been on so many awesome adventures and trips together, done so many cool things, and makes me smile like no other. I don't want him to disappear, he seems to feel the same, but I dunno if he has the guts to break up with her in person if he couldn't do it after three tries over long distance, if I should even be pushing for that, and how to be able to stay in contact with him while she's there. I suspect it'll get better when the school year starts again, but I'm still a tad miffed. He's a complete softie and she knows how to manipulate his emotions (and he's aware of it).

She says she's not mad that he gave them money, she says she's mad that he didn't tell her about it. But when I try to calm her down by telling her that it isn't a good idea to incite an argument when you know yourself about this she still continues to argue about it, referencing my uncle and the money and such.

My brother (who has no job, lives in our home, and gets into arguments for me for the utmost stupidest reasons ever.) told my mom that he wanted nothing to do with this.

My mom and dad still continue to argue but this is how it starts, at first my mom and dad will be enjoying themselves in the dining room or in front of the TV. But my mom then references the money or my dad does something my mom doesn't like. Then the yelling starts.

They've already threatened each other with divorce and my mom keeps telling me that if this **keeps going**, she will wait until I enter college in two years for the divorce. 

I tried talking to my mom about this while my dad is in Seattle for work but she isn't the kind of person to listen.

For example I say, Dude, you don't need to make a big fuss about this. If you argue with your dad, just call me and brothers name over and we'll talk with dad together. You don't need to make it into a huge argument.

But she would reply, You know your father, he isn't someone to be reasoned with. He told me that he never told me because I wouldn't have allowed it, but I would have if he asked.

---   
**tl;dr**: Dad sends money to relatives and tells them to keep it a secret, turns out that my uncle kept 1100 out of what my dad my other uncle sends. Third uncle returns 400 dollars but says This is for you. Mom find out that my dad and his entire family lied to her and that my third uncle wasn't honest in returning some of the money. Older brother says he wants nothing to do with this. They are threatening with divorce.

Before I moved into my new house she would literally come into my house and fill a large handbag with things I own. She would would around the house picking up anything that takes her fancy and leave. 
One example of the most recent bag I took off her went like this:

Tomato ketchup,
Shampoo, 
Hair Serum, 
Keyring off my carkeys,
Shoes,
Two dresses,
Multiple pairs of earrings,
Bathroom tissue,
Deodorant, 
Socks,

A scarf,
Eye glasses,
A handbag,
a dice.

I had to bar her from my house and remember not to leave anything of mine in our parents house unattended because she would steal them.

She doesn't even hide it from me. I will often meet her in a full outfit of my clothes with my handbag full of my makeup and hairbrush etc.
When I challenge her it comes to a fight. Always, a huge massive fight with hair and punches flying. There is no way of dealing with her. If she feels confronted or that someone is trying to tell her what to do or even if she feels she has nothing to say back, out come the fists.

She has a daughter whom I adore and so I keep a relationship with her just to see my niece. 
I often go babysitting and come home with a car full of my things that I've found around her house, cups, plates, blankets... the lost is ridiculous and endless.

I have moved away now and she can't get at any of my things which is great but now she's started stealing from my mother and my other sister Makeup, clothes, shoes, cutlery... generally anything.

My mother wont ban her from the house because she adores her granddaughter and my little sister has had to keep her door locked at all times. In fact one day this infuriated thief sister so much that she kicked her bedroom door in because she wouldn't let her in.


Everybody has told her that its unacceptable. I've told her to seek help many times. She doesn't have a habit to pay for and has enough money to buy things of her own.

I last met her out where she was wearing a designer dress that I hadn't even worn yet and still had the tags on.. I asked her where she go it and she told me that it looked better on her and she found it in her car???that she ''was raised to steal''!!!

Nobody in my family was raised to steal. 

Yet, she goes about telling people that we had a very poor childhood, that we never had things of our own and our parents were abusive and negligent. She tells people that I have always been stealing off of her if they see me wearing or using something that I have gotten back off of her. I was once asked by a random stranger on the street what I was doing with her handbag. Apparently she was a friend of my sister who had given it to her as a gift!! My 100 euro handbag!

Anyways, if anyone has had any experience with this and has any advice on dealing with it that would be super awesome!

1139,39ikkw,"Sorry in advance for grammar I'm on my phone and in a bit of a hurry.


My girlfriend and I moved to a new city about 2 months ago because she got a promotion. About two weeks after we got here she said that she was going to go out with a girl from work and she would call me if she needed a ride. At about 2 am I woke up and she wasn't home so I called and texted but got no answer. I ended up calling about a half dozen times because I was really worried. She got home at about 5 am and said she was really sorry she had fallen asleep on her friends couch. I was not happy with the situation and asked her to please not to do that to me as I didn't think it was really appropriate to be coming home at that hour. All was forgiven and she assured me it wouldn't happen again.
Since then she has pulled what I would consider a vanishing act each time she leaves the house. First it was I gotta go to the office real fast to drop off a piece of paper I said that would be fine but then she comes home 5 hours later (1030 pm) saying she got tied up doing some other stuff. I said I understand but I would really appreciate it if she could just call or text that she is gonna be later than expected. Again she said she understood why I'm upset and would say something in the future.


Next she said her friend forgot his walet so she is going to take him some lunch and would be back in an hour or so. She texted me about two hours later saying sorry it took longer than expected and she was waiting on him. I asked if she was just gonna pick him up something or if they were going to go out to eat. She replied just picking up and she would be home. About 2 more hours had passed and she said they went out to eat and she was bringing me food. I said thanks for the meal but again I would really appreciate if she could just be honest and up front with me about how long she's going to be gone.


As this has happened a couple of times now we sat down and I made her aware of how it made me feel that she says she is going to do one thing and then plans change each time she leaves. I get plans can change but again I would just like to not be left in the dark.


One Thursday night at about 8 pm she said she was going to have go have a couple of drinks with people to work if that's okay. Of course i said yes absolutely have fun. Well that might I went to bed but woke up at about 0130 and she was gone still. I texted her and she said she was about to leave and ended up getting home at about 0230 ( bars close at 2 ). This time I'm getting angry and tell her that this cannot keep happening as it makes me feel very uneasy that she leaves saying one thing (a couple of drinks) then Comes home 6 hours later. That's not a couple of drinks in my eyes but maybe I'm being to nitpicky.


A couple of nights ago around 1830 she went to get her hair cut and after she had been out for a couple of hours I asked her to pick me up something from the gas station. She replied that yes she would but she went out for a few drinks after her hair. I say are you going to be late? And she replies no I won't be late I promise. Well tonight i stay up waiting because I want to see her hair. I text her a little past 1 am asking when she is going to be home and she said she was waiting on her friend. I remind her that I've told her how it makes me feel when she says one thing and does another and ask if she contines to do this to me. She responded by saying no she is just waiting on her friend and will be home in a bit.


Not 24 hours later she left to get her nails done for a wedding we are going to. I ask her if she wants to get something to eat afterwards and she says no she'll just grab something on the way home. Okay no problem I thought. Then 2 hours later I text to see how things are going because the nail place had been closed for 30 minutes and she said she was thinking about going to get drinks in a city about 30 minute away. I text her and ask her to bring something by the house and she responded saying she was already at the place for drinks.


At this point I am absolutely livid that she has such a disregard to my feelings on 1 not being included in any of her plans and 2 not being told that she is doing some that she wasn't originally planning on. I'm not asking her to ask for permission. I've never told her no don't go do that or okay but be home by a certain time I'm just asking her to communicate what she has going on and to be honest about it. She is telling me how it's embarrassing that I get mad anytime she does anything and I try to remind her the only reason I'm upset is that she just can't be honest about what's going on.


I guess I came here to kind of rant but am I just being ridiculous? I trust her and don't want to think the worst but it's been nagging at me if she's not truthful about this what else insane lying about is what I think. I don't snoop thru her phone or demand to know who she is talking to at all times. But i think that giving your boyfriend who you live with and who is watching your son a heads up as to what's going on is am unreasonable request.


After last night she got home and I was packing my things. She promised to communicate her plans to me better and asked me to stAy. I asked if her if I was being unreasonable and she said no but I'm just flabbergasted that this is still continuing.

My girlfriend is really the most beautiful girl I've ever met. She has the brain, the looks, everything. We both really think we have something here. 

Nobody is perfect though -- sometimes she is really.... weird. She gets mad at me for any reason she could find. We often have an argument and don't talk for the rest of the night, and the next day we're not fine until I apologize. Yes, until **I** apologize, no matter who's right or wrong in an argument.


It's bugging me so much, I can't handle it anymore. This just happened. I'll give some background first: we both are on a second year in college and I have a subject from first year which I didn't pass, advanced math actually. Homework from that subject is extremely hard and only really good students can do it fully. The rest of us can do two or three problems but not everything.


Since I don't have any friends that didn't pass adv. math I have to find some other people that could help me out and I could help them out. My college has a webpage that has a chat in it, so every student can go online and talk with other people blah blah. I've asked one student there, a girl actually, if she did any problem from the homework. I've did problems 3-to-6, she did 1-to-3, so we exchanged solutions. And done, nothing more happened.


Apparently, my gf is somehow mad at me because of that. I have no idea why. I've never been like that. She has an ex that calls her, adds her on facebook and then deletes her, sends her messages... She has other people hit on her when she's out with girls, and I don't mind because I know that in the end of the day, I love her and she loves me, no matter what. We really think we can have a serious thing going on here, but she has turned into a jealous-fucking-monster lately, and it's rather ridiculous.


Ofcourse, she's mad at me. She won't talk to me. I have to tell her my side of the story but I can't reach her. She's offline on Facebook, she turned off her cell and... There. Am I wrong here? I should add that I didn't tell her explicitly: Hey, MY_GF, I'm talking with person A. He didn't finish homework. Now I'm talking to person B and she did. We're exchanging solutions atm.... Was I supposed to tell her? I don't know, she was never jealous this much. I mean, she was but a little. It's cute jealousy, when we see our partners with someone else, especially when we weren't in a relationship... but DAMN, this is way too much in my honest opinion.

So.... What do? I have no idea how to react, I'm so mad at her for being this ridiculous but if I tell her that I think she'll get even more mad at me. Fuck.

She's not looking for him to break off with his wife for her, but the whole thing upsets me.  My mom knows what it is like to be cheated on, so the fact she'd even make herself available for a taken man confuses me.

She knows my opinion on cheaters.  I have absolutely no tolerance.  But, I've never seen this guy, the two rarely meet up and when they do, it's far away from me (I currently live with my mom). I know they text all the time, since she has a specific ringtone for him that I hear going off all the time (blech).

My issue is that I feel sick now at the idea of the whole thing.  I don't want to fake anything or lie for either him or my mom.

He's been trying a little harder than before although I sometimes feel like the emotional aspect of dating is still missing. I know it's there because he chased me pretty hard in the beginning. Is it a case of him losing interest after winning the chase?

Part of me feels like he has cold feet but when I confront him about it, he denies it saying he just has emotional issues he's dealing with and he still likes me. He goes even as far as telling me I'm literally perfect for him and just being around me makes him act irrational. It just makes me wonder why I don't feel that way. He acts kinda disinterested sometimes.

Ok, so my fiancé and I have been dating since high school and this past year I popped the question and she said yes. Our sex life was great for the first half of our relationship but now it is really struggling. The first problems started off a few years ago as us not having sex as frequently as we used to (which i just chalked up to being a long term relationship) but now i find us having sex more often but i really don't get anything out of it anymore. It's not that I don't find my fiancé attractive anymore because I really think she is. She is fit, pretty and all of that if not a little plain.

The problem comes in when we actually have sex, it just doesn't do anything for me anymore. I can go for a long while and get her to have multiple orgasms but it just never happens for me. It's like i am going through the motions to satify her but I never reach orgasm. This has led to me not being motivated to have sex with her anymore for my own enjoyment and thus we have it only when she wants to.

I have tried to talk to her very openly about my problem and that I would like to spice up our sex lives but she is either unwilling to try anything or entirely too shy to really talk about it and just freezes up. I end up getting frustrated because she doesn't say anything back to me and I end up dropping it. I have made it clear that I don't enjoy our sex anymore and that her unwillingness to do want to try anything different has made me get to the point where I only do it for her. 

I have A LOT of friends in the BDSM community locally and many of them are in poly relationships for this very reason. They are in love with their partners but can't get everything they need from them. As a result, I tried to talk to her about this in a very adult way and it went very poorly. She started crying and got very down on herself about it. I completely got where she is coming from and dropped the subject yet again. I don't want to cause any sort of discomfort or awkwardness for her... 

I love this girl more than anything but I am really struggling with this. My issues with this are causing problems in other areas of our relationship now because I am so frustrated in our sex lives. I don't feel as close to her as I used to and it is showing. We get in more fights now (about little things) and when we get into fights my instinctual reaction now is to distance myself from the conflict. Just make her happy and put an end to it. It's killing me. I know that some people will read this and just tell me to suck it up and deal with it because it is just sex but for me sex is a big part of relationships and life. 

It's made harder for me by the fact that I have a lot of women flirting with me and actually giving me attention on a regular basis. I'm not trying to toot my own horn here but it is a factor in this equation that makes this much harder on me. I don't want to cheat on my fiancé. I couldn't do that to her. 

What do i do? Do I suffer in silence and just try to carry on? I have tried to be as open and honest with her about this but it hasn't gotten me anywhere. I feel like I'm lost in a lose-lose situation. Either I suffer more and more or I end a relationship with a girl I love more than anyone over sex.

Fast forward to the 17th. My mother has come across an online community board thing, advertising a dog who's owner has passed away and is in the care of an extended family member who cannot keep her. She is healthy and there is no cost to adopt her, she just needs a good home. My mother decides to use the excuse, that my Grandmother (80F and lives with us) needs the dog to help her cope. This was infuriating to hear, because my Grandmother has Dementia and can barely take care of herself, much less another dog. Therefore I would have to care for it. My mother was going to bring the dog home for a trial and if my Grandmother didn't want it, Mom would take her to the Humane Society herself. Thankfully I was able to talk her out of it entirely, and since another one of her co-workers was interested they went and looked at the dog instead. 

Now we arrive to today (25th). My Mom makes an announcement earlier this afternoon that we are caring for a co-workers dog for a WEEK. I am instantly pissed because I thought after having countless conversations about not being ready to have another dog in the house, I feel as she has completely ignored them. I don't have any plans to help her with its care, because hey, why should I? And of course there's my Grandmother, who doesn't drive and would be home all day with the dog while my Mother and I are both at work. She would be the one expected to let the dog outside so it didn't pee/poo in the house (like it did when it first came into the house today :/) and keep an eye on it. 

I want NOTHING to do with this animal while it is here, especially when my Mom has continuously ignored my pleas for allowing me to grieve. I don't want it in or near my room, I don't want to socialize with it, and I don't want it near me. I am currently not in the emotional position to take on another dog right now, temporarily OR permanently, and frankly I'm not sure WHEN I'll be ready. I love dogs, but I don't want my loss to impact a future adoption. I don't want to fear losing my next dog before I've even met him/her. 

So, how can I get it through my Mom's head that she needs to stop forcing my grief away? I really wasn't expecting this today, as it is only bringing back sadness and hurt.

Anyone have any advice for how to make it as soft as possible?  She is also a little bit fragile in the mind.  If I could do break it off, and have her just accept it without melting down, I would do it.  But I dont know how to do that.  Any advice?  

TL:DR;  I dont want to crush my girlfriends soul when I break up with her.  She is really clingy, but very kind and sweet.  This will blind side her.  How do I let her own easy?   She has always been supportive and wonderful to me, and I just dont want to hurt her.

932,2wdn5k,"My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost a year, and I am very deeply in love with him, which I told him about 6 months into our relationship. He did not reciprocate my words or feelings, which made me insecure but I didn't say anything about it at first. My insecurities about it got worse and I brought it up to him (not in the most mature way, there were tears involved) and he basically told me he doesn't love me and doesn't know if he ever will. He also told me that although he told his ex girlfriend he loved her, he now believes that what he felt wasn't actually love. Part of me thinks maybe she hurt him so badly that he tells himself this to cushion the blow, but it's not my business and I'd never tell him that.

Since then, we have talked about it a couple times (sometimes maturely, sometimes not so much). He tells me that he doesn't believe a relationship needs love to be a good one, and when I bring up the topic of our future he says he doesn't think we need love to have a future together.

I'm so confused and hurt about this. If he hasn't loved me after this long, is it possible he ever will? Part of me thinks I'm just comfortable for him and he's waiting with me until he finds someone he can truly love. I don't want to fall deeper and deeper in love with him only to end up getting badly hurt because I was dumb for waiting so long.

But on the other hand, it's not his fault he doesn't love me, hr can't control how he feels. And he has had his heart hurt in the past, maybe this is his way of trying to protect himself. Maybe he's right, maybe love isn't necessary for our future.
I would love any insight or advice any of you have on this. My mind is so flooded with this that it would be nice to have an outsider's opinion. I've given up talking to my girlfriends about any of this because they just tell me to break up with him. I love him so, so much and I don't feel like this is something to break up over.

I met her at our workplace when she was having her internship and I was working part time. She is a very interesting girl who is always cheerful and can be very direct in the way she speaks. She didn't have any experience in a relationship and is clueless when I dated her out. After a few dates I decided to make her my girlfriend.

Things went very well for the first 1 and a half month, we text each other every day, all the care and concern as well as being very sweet towards me.

However, things changed nearing 2 month into the relationship, she started not replying my messages as usual, her replies are cold and half hearted. I asked her, and she told me she is unsure if she really liked me or she just cannot commit to the r/s. I was devastated. I cried and searched for every possible little detail which I may have wronged her.

After she said that, she started a part time job, when I messaged her, it seems like I am the most annoying person there is on earth. There were times I would let it go and think she's probably busy/tired. And times where I would panic and send more messages which annoy her even more.

We went out a few times (lesser than usual). And it's not the same anymore. She isn't laughing at my jokes, when I talked about anything, it seemed to have annoy her as well. Things got worst and during our last date, she just stopped talking altogether. We went home early and she wanted to meet me the next day which I know what is going to happen.

We met. I tried to save the r/s and she said she find it very difficult and suffocating. I felt relieved. But I kept thinking why would she suddenly changed and I can't accept that she changed so suddenly. It's been 3 months and I still want her back.

420,2qihf1,"About 3 months ago, I met this guy, we'll call him Jason on a crazy night out at a bar in my city. He was super-engaging and super-fun, but he seemed really interested in my friend and *his* friend Frank seemed really interested in me, so nothing happened between me and Jason, except he took my number because he wanted me to send him some photos from our night out, and he said he wanted to be able to reach my friend, who didn't have a phone.


Flash-forward about a week, Frank is texting me every day, asking me when he can take me out for coffee and buy my flowers and practice his English with me since he's new to this country. I think he's sweet, but I'm not really interested and don't want to lead him on: I'm not the kind of nice girl he's interested in. I'm a little promiscuous and I'm kinda of into being single and playing the field and I don't know how to convey this to the poor guy who wants to buy me flowers. But Jason seems more like he understands that, and his english is way way better, SO, I text Jason and ask him to please explain all this to his friend in their native language that I'm just not the kind of girl he's looking for. Jason asks what kind of girl I *am*, and I start telling him about some of my sexual exploits because, again, he seems down with a girl who's a little more modern. As I suspect, he acts super cool about it (and actually actively interested in hearing about my experiences) and we get so into talking about it that we wind up meeting at a bar and... well, you know. This is the premise upon which our entire relationship is founded.


Flash forward again 3 months later, and Jason and I are dating and having the same circular argument practically every day: He knows I went on an extended trip recently to South America and fooled around a lot down there and that I'm still Facebook friends with some of the guys I hooked up with, because they were also people I liked and became friends with. He gets FURIOUS and jealous if I mention: South America, salsa music, the Spanish language (which I am actively learning to speak and he knows it), literally any Spanish-speaking country even if I've never been there and it's on the wrong continent. An entire 5-month period of my life, a huge segment of the population of planet Earth, and the language I'm practicing daily are off-limits for discussion or he gets angry. God help me if my iPod shuffles to Enrique Iglesias by accident, and he's from fucking SPAIN. he insisted i not talk about my past sexual history or anything in South America and i honored his request, but he still found ways to bring stuff up and then blame it on me. I asked him to go 3 weeks without talking about my past, and he made it about a day.


On top of that, he gets jealous if I talk about sex, joke about sex, have friends who talk about joke or sex, look at any website that has a picture of a penis on it. For instance, tonight I sent him this EXTREMELY NSFW but VERY FUNNY picture and accompanying text (from the critique my dick pic tumblr, which everyone should read daily), and he completely lost his shit. It was probably a BAD idea to send it to him in the first place and I was probably subconsciously trying to provoke him a little bit, but the thing is SO FREAKING FUNNY that i thought if he saw it he'd stop flipping out about me looking at dicks online and understand where i'm coming from here. i mean he KNEW from the beginning that i had a crude sense of humor and was really sexually open!! Anyway after I sent that to him, he cut contact with me for about an hour, then he flipped out at me and complained that he just wants me to be classy, that he's told me not to send him stuff like this but i'm just trying to make him crazy. now, I know people have really different expectations about what's ok in relationships, but for god's sake, he looks at porn all the time, he has posters of beautiful women on his walls, and he used to ask me all the time about doing a threesome. the kicker, on top of all of this, is that he said from the very beginning and has continued to say all the time that he DOES NOT WANT a relationship. He's fine with dating and neither of us is sleeping with anyone else, but he doesn't want us to put a label on it. In my mind, that's totally fine, except it means he doesn't really get any say in what websites i read or who my facebook friends are. he keeps tinder and plentyoffish and snapchat on his phone and i have no idea if he still uses them and i don't make a fuss about it. if he goes out to the club with his friends, i trust that he won't fool around. i'm 100% faithful to him physically and i'm never even alone with other men who aren't related to me. there are a few people who flirt with me on occasion via facebook, etc. and a few exes i keep in touch with casually, but i would happily cut them off in a heartbeat if Jason and I decided to get serious.


anyway, he gets into these fits of jealousy and he says terrible things. he tells me to go fuck myself, etc. then he turns off his phone or deactivates his facebook or blocks me or all of those at once, and won't talk to me for anywhere between a couple of hours and a couple of days. he has threatened to pull out of trips and plans with friends at literally the last second (at times, after i've gone to pick up a borrowed car or made reservations or bought tickets for things) because i keep doing this to him. sometimes he'll even come up with a test right before a major step in the relationship (eg. i'm going to sleep over at his new place for the first time, we're going on a weekend trip, etc.), like he'll ask me to delete someone on facebook that he knows i was involved with in the past, and if i don't, he'll threaten to cancel the trip. and again, i know people have different standards, i think it's totally reasonable for him not to be cool with me being friends with these people if we're in a relationship, but he would need to first ask me to be in a relationship with him, and then ask me in a reasonable, non-threatening way, to delete them, right? or am I crazy?


i would walk away, except that every time this happens, he gets so sweet and tender afterwards. he tells me he's just sad because he wants me to like him, he doesn't think he's good enough for me, he just wants us to have a chance, etc. I can tell this is coming from a place of real emotional need and sadness. he's not being intentionally manipulative. he is a sad, sad puppy. he has a few close relationships and in particular one very close, very sweet and supportive friend who confirms that he's not a dickhead. he's never hurt me or done anything to make me feel scared or unsafe, he just makes me feel like i'm crazy and frankly, kind of dirty when he tells me how disgusted he is about my past. i'm not ashamed of any of my choices, but he makes me feel like i should be, but then he tells me he only feels that way because he cares, and i start to feel NUTS, and to feel GUILTY for making him feel inadequate.


this week i sort of decided for myself that it was probably at least time to take a break to think about things and focus on ourselves, but he convinced me to go and see him so i did. i tried to really pay attention to what was going on and it felt like he was never listening to my side of things. i brought up the issue with him a few times but it kept happening. later that night, after we'd already discussed a few times that i felt he didn't care what i had to say, he asked me my opinion about a political issue and before I could get out a couple of sentences, he sort of laughed at me and then told me i was wrong and gave a 20 minute speech about why. we got into a conversation about two celebrities and i thought his opinion was a little bit sexist, and when i tried to explain why, he refused to listen, and turned on his iPod. at that point i got really fed up and (i'm really embarrassed to admit) i had half a glass of water in my hand, so i splashed it in his face. i didn't throw the glass or hurt him or damage his phone in any way. it was really a small amount of water. and we were in private so it wasn't like i humiliated him or anything, i just made him cold and wet for a second. still, obviously, i feel really shitty about it because i should NOT have lost control like that. but now he's taking it and making it sound like i am some sort of abuser because i lost my shit with HIS behavior, and it's really hard for me to tell if i'm in the wrong or not here. then he says crazy shit like i threw the water at him because he's brown (actually i LOVE his skin color, but it's irrelevant) and that i wouldn't have done it if he were an american guy or a latin guy (which doesn't even make sense because he is whiter than most latin guys). i apologized like crazy and we had a nice rest of the day, and then today i told him you know what, the fact that i had that kind of emotional reaction and that i threw water was a BAD sign. I'm not supposed to behave like that in a relationship and i know it. So i told him maybe it would be best if we took a short break to think about stuff, which he had suggested more than once anyway, because he said I was making him crazy. So I asked him what he thought about us taking some time apart to think, and he didn't really answer, he just kind of implied we'd talk about it later. then like, maybe an hour later he facetimed me all sweet and affection, asking how my day was and if i would make him cookies.


so he just goes back and forth and back and forth between being so sweet and tender and nice and planning out loud for our future (but don't forget, i'm STILL not his girlfriend) and cutting off contact, telling me to fuck myself, telling me to never call him again, telling me i hate him or he's not good enough for me, telling me he's disgusted with the things that i've done, telling me he really cares about me but wishes i would change...and pretending NOTHING ever happened and everything is fine and great.


in the rare moments when he is totally lucid and calm, he acknowledges to me (and his best friend) that he goes crazy sometimes. he says it's best to leave him alone when he's like this. so he's aware that there's something off about him. but if i left him alone every time he got mad at me over something... well, we wouldn't ever see each other anymore, practically.


speaking of which, tonight, after the dick pic argument, we calmed down and decided to take that break in speaking to each other, but then (stupid stupid stupid and with a glass of wine in me) slipped in with something to the effect of ok, and I hope you find someone to talk to, because i think you're approaching the relationships in your life with way too much fear and anger and it's not good for you. which completely set him off and caused him to tell me to go fuck myself, never speak to him again, we're done, etc. and block me on everything except facebook, where he posted Finally fucking freedom!!! cool. great.


i know i've been going on forever but there's just a bit more: most of our arguments (except the water thing, obviously) have happened over text or the phone. when we are actually together and in person, we are incredibly affectionate and happy with one another. i have never been in a relationship that felt so wonderful and supportive, that had such a fun, easy rapport, etc etc. we go on lots of fun little dates together and we always have a fantastic time together -- it just really works. that's what makes it SO hard to deal with everything else. that's what makes me not run for the hills even though all this shit has come up after only 3 months. and the fear that i'm the crazy one and that i'm somehow causing all of this. my friends have said things like abusive controlling and i wouldn't tolerate behavior like that, when i talk about how he's behaved, but i can't help seeing the good in him and wondering if i'm causing even at least a small part of the bad.



I guess this is more a long rant and a request for general emotional support, but in terms of actual questions to think about, I guess...1) Should I have have been more receptive to his requests to act more classy and am I going to wind up forever-alone if I don't start hiding my past? (ok kind of rhetorical on the second half, but i really need the emotional support now, guys). 2) How much of this is him and how much is me? 3) We probably need to end the relationship now, since I think too much damage has been done, but is there any possibility of him getting help and us salvaging a friendship? (that could theoretically turn into a relationship like years from now if we wanted it because dammit we have SO much fun together and in so many ways we want the same things out of life...)?? Or should I just cut and run?


please help. i'm starting to fall in love here and i know the situation is really not healthy.

****UPDATE:**** SO last night we were arguing again and he gets fed up with me and tells me, you know what, that's it, I've got a date tonight? I say what do you mean a date, he says I've been texting with this girl, she's going to meet me down the street at a bar and I'm gonna fuck her because you hurt me. I had a lot of wine in me and I got really upset, begging him not to go, apologizing for making him jealous, blah blah blah. this goes back and forth for an hour and then it sorta clicks (WOW I am really stupid for letting it take this long to click hehe): there is nothing normal or acceptable or rational about threatening to have sex with someone else just to spite me, even if i had done something truly horrible to him, which obviously i haven't. so after a while longer he's still threatening and threatening and finally instead of arguing with him i just start saying ok have fun ok cool. he's telling me he's at a bar with this girl, about to take her home, but he's still texting me, calling me, threatening me, and I'm thinking, ok, even if there is a real girl and a real bar, there's no way she's patiently waiting for him, it's been another hour now. and anyway it doesn't matter because he's acting SUPER psycho. once he realizes i'm not reacting to him, he unleashes a torrent of name-calling. i'm a disgusting slut and he doesn't think God will ever forgive me for my slutty past and i'm a drug addict and he hopes i'll die from it (i smoke occasionally for medical reasons), he's gonna send me pictures while this girl is blowing him and a bunch of other fun stuff like he tells me By the way i have herpes so now you have it too and that i live in the trash and he was just trying to take me out but i should go back to living in the trash with all of my friends and that HIS friend is gonna call and tell me to leave him alone (??). and then he's like ok i'm gonna block you now. i say ok, he says ready? i say ok so he blocks me on his phone, deletes his whatsapp, etc etc and i say nothing. he turns all of it BACK ON later just to, i don't know, see if I'm sad that he blocked me?

So basically, now it's super SUPER clear that he is a raving psycho. i feel a little bit guilty for egging him on (i divulged some more stuff about my past to see how he would react, which I know was kinda taunting him, but better than the alternative i guess)...but i think now i know for sure it's time to really let him go and take some time to fix myself. i am close-ish with his best friend and i will try to get his friend to keep encouraging him to go to therapy....

I thought she was joking at first. She was like well it's only for two weeks before you move out (School lets out etc) and YOU will play with it and stuff. It's a puppy I am going to play with it if its out and about.

That is besides the point I just got blindsided that we will be getting a potential hazard (Pee, noise etc) that could get us into serious trouble with the complex (NO PETS ALLOWED). Not mention I doubt she even has time/money for the puppy -She complains about the lack of money constantly-. Do I have the right to be angry with her?

656,3afv9l,"So here's the quick and dirty version:



I am a 26 year old female who has only had one serious bf (20-22). We lived together, he proposed, I said no, he then became very violent and abusive. After I was able to run away he stalked me for many months following the end of our relationship. 


And I suppose to go back even further, my dad passed away when I was 13, and my mother was a violent abuser as well. 

I've sought therapy, I've come to the emotional terms that I need to with my past and I have been ready to move on.


I've dated (this whole online thing all feels like its lacking a sort of genuineness to it, or maybe it's just me) a few guys here and there, and nothing seems to hold. I wonder if maybe I'm acting clingy without realizing it (I try not to text too often before a date, and I try to be myself as much as possible). I don't bring up my past or make any hints towards it (honestly, its kind of embarrassing, so I don't tell too many people about it). It's been a year and a half since my last date. No prospects either. But I haven't really been looking at this point since my prospects are so grim. I've tried OK Cupid, Match.com, r/r4r, hell even EHarmony.com. I've made tons of friends at my university, and I have plenty of hobbies and activities to keep me busy. Work isn't an option since I work for a really, really, really, small attorney's office. But nothing has really happened for me, and I'm getting pretty lonely. 


So my question is, how can people who have had, for the most part (with the exclusion of my friends), mostly poor interpersonal relationships have or learn to have successful relationships when getting a date is pretty difficult?

1036,286v7x,"Like straight after. I got mad at him because he kept knocking things down and things and afterwards, he said that that was really awkward. I cried because lately I've been pretty stressed and I didn't mean to take it out on him, but then I told him my thoughts. What I said was that I thought I didn't find him that physically attractive and then he got teary, got dressed and then left saying he was going to eat some McDonalds.

I partly feel like he didn't care about my opinion enough to want to start working out, but I also know I am not justified in saying that since we have only been together for six months and a bit. I think this is the end of our relationship, but I think this could also be fixed. He's a really great person to talk to and we get along in every sense. 

It's only that that is the new issue. I haven't felt like this long, but when I brought up the topic of working out, he said we should both do it. I decided I should so that I would be fair to him, but I haven't done it for a bit since I recently got an Implanon NXT injected into my arm, which I think may be affecting me emotionally. 

I guess I just want some advice on how to proceed, but I know I have to give him some space, obviously, so he can sort out his thoughts.

Edit - I probably should add that we never argued about serious things, but he was really sensitive about me making comments about his pets...

464,2ovkhm,"Warning: this is long and complicated.

We've been married a week. He (31/m) cheated on his wife (34/f) with me (24/f). I ended the relationship I was in as soon as I fell in love with him. He ended his shortly after that. She found out, they filed for divorce, and now she has moved back to her original home. 
I am also pregnant. 
He helps her whenever she calls regardless of the time or what he is doing at that moment. He can't say no. This has resulted in him having to go out of his way and spend his money to make sure she is okay. I voiced my concern about it because the things she is asking for him to do are not realistic. She has cornered him, called other people to come and hurt him resulting in the police being called, and has ruined most of his belongings. 
I see her as toxic and don't trust her with his safety. I worry that she will do anything to hurt him. 
He is also very controlling when it comes to my exes. I was previously engaged and kept in contact with my ex due to things being in our names. He made me change my number, stop all contact, and I let him know if they ever contact me. 
He used to always tell me when she calls or texts, but lately I noticed I would find out after the fact. That bothered me, but I let it go and was thankful he was telling me. 
A day before our wedding she apparently needed him. So he, once again, went to the rescue. He also made it a point to tell others not to tell me what he was doing. He deleted text threads as well. I found that she was talking to him all that day and apparently about how she will miss him. I find out the next day that he lied to me and told others to lie for him. 
I just moved 1,000 miles away from everything and everyone I have and found this out during the move. 
He says he wants to make everyone happy and that he feels so much guilt for what he did to her. He didn't want to tell me because he knew I would get upset. 
I'm not sure what to do or even how to handle the situation. She is still texting him pictures of herself and other things pertaining to their relationship. 
I don't want to be controlling. I don't want to tell him what to do. I just want him to understand how I feel. I explain how I feel and how would he feel if I did that with my ex and he says it isn't the same, that my relationship isn't anything like his marriage.

1140,3hm7yw,"This just happened and is still happening... Sorry for the long post, and of course this is a throwaway.

Three weeks ago, my boyfriend of over 14 years tells me he's not in love with me anymore, he's not happy and not sure what he wants but cannot tell me any reasons why. This is out of nowhere as our relationship was good, or so I thought. We rarely fight, our sex life is phenomenal and we're buying a house together at the end of *this* month. 

So for me, it's a complete shock to hear this. Obviously, I'm confused and become distraught and an emotional wreck. I start to question him, over and over, but he tells me nothing. All I want are answers, some idea of why he would suddenly do this out of nowhere. He leaves two days later and spends over a week with mutual married friends of ours to think things through.

In this time apart, I receive our phone bill (that I pay) and notice that he is calling and texting a girl that we know. I mean, hundreds of texts and hundreds of minutes of phone calls - leading up to the big announcement and then while he is away. My gut tells me something is wrong. I ask him about it, and he denies that anything is happening that they are just friends catching up (they have known each other since middle school but have been out of touch for over a decade). 

I'm trying to understand and give him the benefit of the doubt. He tells me I'm paranoid, jealous, crazy, bipolar, a bitch... you name it, I heard it. I felt devastated, I started to question my own sanity and self worth. I stopped eating, started drinking more and became a very sad and confused person.

He comes back a week and half later and asks me to just forgive him and let's forget about it. Says that he will distance himself from this friend because now he thinks that she may want to be more than just friends and he doesn't feel ethical about it because he loves me. 

First, how does one just forget that the love of their life told them horrible things about who they are and the entire relationship and life they've built and planned together? Well I can tell you it doesn't work. It's impossible to just act like you are not broken inside. Secondly, what in the hell do you mean that she may want to be more than just friends when you've denied any accusation I've made in the last almost two weeks?

So I try. And I fail at pretending. I still want answers, I still need closure and to understand. And then he decides that it's not fair that he should not be friends with this girl because nothing is happening and says that they will continue to be friends and that I should get deal with it. Then he downloads snapchat at her request. Wtf?

You know I questioned him about it, and he insists it's just a way for them (now he's including her kid in this, too) to all keep in touch and it won't show up on the bill to make me worry. [[I'd like to say now that typing this out sounds so much more fucked up than it does in my head, well maybe not but reliving the last three weeks in black and white is so hard and my head is royally fucked!]]

So Monday and all day yesterday I put on my detective hat and do some digging. In the end, I find evidence and I bring it up just last night. Suddenly I get the truth. He is falling in love with this old friend from his past but didn't want to hurt me. So they (yes she knew he was falling for her and come to find out most likely has feelings for him, too) decided that they didn't want to hurt me and that there brilliant master plan was to try to not let it get out of hand, since nothing physical has happened, and just keep it a secret and maybe they could *just* be friends and I wouldn't have to know. Well I was hurt three weeks ago, so that is bullshit.

Seriously. He basically was gaslighting me the entire time, manipulating me and hoping that I would just forgive, forget and we would move into the new house and be good again and that he would somehow, suddenly stop having feelings for this other girl, even though they were talking everyday, flirting and what have you. I'm still processing all this information, because even though he broke my heart 3 weeks ago it wasn't until yesterday evening that he finally told me the truth.

The idea, right now, is to work things out since neither of us like the idea of throwing away a 14+ year relationship. I've given an ultimatum, choose one of us. If it's me, which he says it is, then she has to be 100% cut out from his life. If it's her, then I won't beg him to stay but I won't be around anymore because my heart couldn't take it, we could not still be friends, at least not for a very long time.

The day is still young, and I'm still very unsure about what or how this is going to work out. He has to break the news to the other girl today, that is my stipulation. Honestly, at this point I feel very empty inside and void. Like my soul and heart have been ripped open and replaced with a dark abyss. It will take a very long time before I can ever trust him again, let alone trust my own heart.

Met a girl online about 2 months ago, we hit it off great. We went on three very successful dinner dates, finally kissed at the end of the third one. We made plans to see each other that weekend. She cancelled that morning, but made plans to reschedule for the following weekend. She invited me to her place to watch a movie. Okay, perfect.

That weekend gets here, boom, she cancels again at the last minute. No problem. So I tell her to just let me know when she is free again and we'll make plans. She doesn't answer, and I get the picture.

A few days later she texts me again, saying how busy she is, but I'll be the first to know when she's free. That was about a week ago. She has been texting me since, initiating contacting throughout the whole week. Unfortunately the text convos don't last long. After about 4-5 texts both ways, she disappears. 

Every time I try and make plans with her, she always responds positively. Smiley faces, yes, definitely's!, or Yes, that would be perfect. But right as it's coming up, she cancels and reschedules. Each and every time. 

I left the ball in her court for now. I told her next time she is free, let me know. She hasn't made plans yet. 

What exactly is going on? Is this some sort of long fade? Is she trying to sneak me into the friend zone, or get me frustrated where I just quit so she doesn't have to be the one to put me down?

We would hang out in our dorm common areas all the time together—usually 3-4 hours a day during the school week and 6-8 hours a day on the weekends, though that’s just a rough estimate (there would be days when we wouldn’t see each other at all, other times we’d spend 18+ hours together). 

We would study together, go to the store together, eat our meals at the same time, watch TV together, make desserts together, take out the trash together. We had a ton of inside jokes and a secret language (language is a rough term—we didn’t know what we were saying to each other, either). Because of all this, I considered him to be a really good friend and I really trusted him. I assumed (though maybe incorrectly), that I was his friend, too. 

I was only in that city for 10ish months before I had to move back to my home country. Now he hardly ever talks to me. In the 7 months that I’ve been gone, he has made zero attempts to contact me, or even acknowledge my existence (as petty as it sounds, not even a “like” on a facebook status). When we were living in the same dormitory, he would occasionally send me articles he thought I’d like, or he’d actually message me first. Even if I do message him, he’ll only hold an actual conversation some of the time and even if he promises to talk to me another time, he doesn’t. I’ve asked if my messages bother him, but he ignores my question.

It’s like I don’t even exist anymore. I just miss my goofy, sweet friend. I miss when we'd talk about everything and nothing for hours. I know people have different communication styles and everything, but it feels like he wants nothing to do with me anymore and it’s making me wonder if we were ever really friends to begin with. It makes me think that maybe he was my friend because he felt bad for me, or I forced him to be my friend. 

Maybe I’m expecting too much from him, or maybe I’m overreacting, or maybe I just don't know how to be a friend. Should I just let this friendship go? Should I keep trying to be friends, and if so, how? Help?

Things were ok . I have lived with her before , but my own house started to feel like it was hers. She would move my stuff around after I had arranged it , buy furniture I didn't even ask or get told I would have. Literally it would just be in my house. She has her bathroom constantly dirty and the brand new carpet in her room is ruined in less than a year of her living here.


I try to talk to my husband about the small things that bother me and I ask him to talk to his mom but he gets very very angry and tells me that I am asking for petty things. 

Recently my husband and I got into an argument in front of her, I later apologized. Then the next day she comes up to me and tells me she will be moving out this month and that I should be better towards my husband because he has a house for me to live in and that I won't find a man like him so easily.


This really upsets me, partly because my husband throws the house in my face in every argument we have and she knows this. And now I have her basically throwing it my face too. I kept my composure and at the most I think I rolled my eyes at it.

451,2bswho,"I've been with my girlfriend since we were 15. I love her so very much. She's currently 7 months pregnant with our first baby and we are very excited to become parents. I've always had a band for fun. We all went to high school together. I started dating my gf and then a few months later made a band with these guys who were previously our friends. The band is nothing serious to me. I have a real job but make music on the side as an outlet and perform at a local coffee house maybe twice a month, paid gig.

My drummers name is Ethan, my rhythm guitarists name is Dylan, and my bassists name is Peter. We all have great relationships and they really love my girlfriend like she's part of the band. She's been nothing but supportive. Attends every gig, records it, and emails it to me so we can put it on our fan page. She bought Dylan a new amp when his broke because she wanted our band to strive. She helps transport our equipment, she's just fantastic. She even learned the guitar to play with me at our house.

Since becoming pregnant she has been really sick. Nauseous but starving. Her back starts killing her if she stands for too long, her feet are always hurting. She's very prone to headaches and has had major headaches. I've been trying very hard to accommodate for her. She's told me in tears how much she loves me as I massage her feet. My band hasn't been very understanding, though.

We usually have band practice at my house because the guys live in apartments with roommates and my girlfriend and I own a house with a room my girlfriend told me could be our jam room. For the past two weeks, my girlfriend has just been so sick. She's been crying a lot because she just wants to eat, she's huge so she needs help standing up and bending over. I try my hardest to help her, she always is apologizing for being difficult but she says she just doesn't feel well and can't feel entirely happy. Since she's been sick, I've asked if we could postpone band practice so my girlfriend could get some sleep. They understood the first time. But yesterday Ethan texted me and said, Look bro, I'm really serious about this band's name and you don't seem to really care about our music. We have to have practice if we want to stay good. I texted him back, Well I'm sorry, girlfriend is very sick right now and would just like to be able to relax. She's starting to feel better, if we could just give her some more time. He texted me back and said, Our music isn't important to you? I texted, It is. But to an extent. I'm a little bit more focused on girlfriend and my baby. If you want to practice, make it somewhere other than our house. He didn't text me back.

My girlfriend and I discussed this last night and she apologized profusely and kept insisting we have band practice, but she is just too sweet and I really just want her to be able to relax. And when I get home from work, I really enjoy relaxing with her on the couch and watching TV instead of sweating my ass off with music. The guys are just absolutely pissed.

On our Facebook messenger, Ethan told the guys I wasn't serious about the band. Dylan told me I was a poser. Peter said he understood girlfriend was sick but it was just music and it wasn't going to make her nauseous. I told them all they were complete assholes for not giving girlfriend a break. I told them all about the shit she did for them and they can't give her a break. She's too big to get around by herself, she can't go to work somedays because she's so big, she just needs rest. I asked if we could practice elsewhere and they all got angry that I was changing the vibe of the band. Ethan claimed I was going to leave the band after the baby came and I told them that wasn't true and to stop being dicks and if they were so mad at me about this, they could just come get their shit they store at my house and go. I haven't been messaging or texting them back because I don't know what to say. My girlfriend feels guilty, but I'm just so pissed. She has done everything for our band and they've just thrown everything back into her face during her entire pregnancy. They aren't even happy for us! They just think it's a drag that we're having a baby. They all still get money from their parents for their homes and food, no steady girlfriends that last more than 6 months, and they are always bouncing jobs. I actually have my shit together. They aren't even excited that my girlfriend and I are getting married after the baby comes. All they see this as is obstacles for the band.

1098,2t6ccc,"I made previous posts here about how a girl I was seeing suddenly dropped off the face of the earth during a stressful class. She kept chalking up her disappearance as stress, simply needing alone time. I gave it to her.

It's been a few days after the class ended, and last night she was still dodgy. I finally pulled it out of her that she didn't want to see me anymore. She says the stress triggered something and I just want to be alone right now.

We had been so good up until now. We went away for NYE for a few nights together and things were perfect. After the trip, she had told me I was perfect, that she missed me, and she was already looking at flights for our next trip. Every morning she texted me telling me she missed me, wanted to see me, the works. I opened myself up emotionally because of that.

However, now that it is over, I feel that I was used a bit. I always paid for dinner. She never offered. I paid for our entire NYE trip (she never even offered to pay one night of the hotel. I even drove the 4 hours up there, she never offered to pay for gas/parking). I took her to a sports game where I treated her to everything. She acted completely fine during the game - held hands, told me how great I was, put her head on my shoulder. Everything. Two days after the game, she ended it. 

There were times when I kept thinking, Is she using me? Why does she never pay? but I just tried to brush it aside. Every time I invited her to my place to just hang and watch a movie, she ALWAYS declined. Busy, sick, etc. The ONLY time she could hang was if we went out to dinner/I treated her to something. 

I know I should be angry and upset but right now it just hurts. I had opened myself emotionally when she told me all these wonderful things and it's just a gutless punch to end things literally DAYS after she told me these things.

I just don't get it. I'm having a hard time understanding it all.

843,2rb06l,"I met this guy at a coffee shop the week before Thanksgiving and he asked me to go to a museum with him. I gave him my number and he texted me soon after I left to say he had a great time talking to me. A week went by (granted it was Thanksgiving week) and I hadn't heard from him, so I asked if he was still interested in going. He said yes and immediately made plans with me.


We went, had a great time. Went back to his place and got intimate. Since, we've seen each other 4 more times, for drinks and conversation, and (very good) sex, and things were seemingly going well. I made him a small Christmas present, because I'm somewhat awful at being affectionate so I show my interest by doing things for people. And I saw him on Dec 23rd, the night before he left for a few days, so I could give it to him. 



During that meet up, we had both talked about how neither of us had plans for New Years Eve. We didn't discuss hanging out, but to me it seemed obvious that that's what would happen and I fully expected him to contact me after he got back on the 28th. Well, that didn't happen. So I ended up spending NYE alone. I texted him on New Year's Day saying we should get together to go to a museum we had discussed previously. I still have not heard from him since leaving his apartment on the 23rd.



Here's some backstory to provide context. When I first met him, he told me his name and what he did, I thought oh, he should be easy to google  so I looked him up to know what I was getting into. Big mistake. I found out that he had gotten married in 2012. I don't think he was stepping out on his wife. He lives in a very small 2 bedroom apartment with a guy that he had never known before moving in with him, and he's only been living there for 2 months. He told me that he had been depressed lately. We never discussed our previous relationships (partly because I didn't want to bring it up because I didn't think he would want to talk about a failed marriage, partly because we had been dating for a relatively short time and it just seemed awkward to talk about).


He also told me that he has a very limited cell phone plan with some ridiculously low number of text messages and minutes per month. At first I thought perhaps that had something to do with him not contacting me, but it's been nearly 2 weeks since I last saw him so I don't think he could've run out of texts/minutes a full 2 weeks before his month was up. 


We only went out like 5 times, so I don't think this guy really owes me anything. Here's my problem. I'm very introverted. I do NOT meet people easily at all. Social interactions are difficult for me. When we met, I initiated the interaction, which is incredibly rare and difficult for me.  I know I was, at times, probably very awkward on our dates. I keep replaying all the stuff that happened in our dates, and blaming myself for why he's not been in contact.



I really want to know what happened, because I'm really confused. Like I've said, I'm not great with people, and really I just want to figure out what went wrong so maybe I can avoid making the same mistakes in the future. Plus, I really liked this guy and I was under the impression that he really liked me based on everything that happened. If he just needs time/space to get over his wife, or maybe to resolve that part of his life before spending more time with me, then I don't want to pester him and end up pushing him away. I know people fade on each other all the time, but it's never happened to me and it really sucks. 


How long should I wait before trying to contact him again? And what would I even say? Should I even bother? I'm not great at dating and this was really promising for me, so I'm a bit crushed and confused.

408,1kd0tl,"I want to start off by saying this has not been an easy decision.  I have been in a constant debate with myself for over 6 months about this because the person I am breaking up with is a truly wonderful man, but I know our relationship will not last.

We met at work over 4 years ago and we were instantly attracted to each other.  I felt like I had to work my ass off for months after we initially made out one night to get him to take me seriously as a co-worker and as a friend.  We started spending a lot of time together and eventually decided to start dating.

The first year was great, but looking back now, I realize I completely changed who I was in order to make him feel more comfortable with me.  I started to isolate myself and chose sitting with him in his apartment (he is pretty quiet and doesn't really have many friends because he refuses to make an effort unless they come to him) over spending time with the people I cared about.  My personality almost did a 180, but I didn't realize that until nearly 2 years into our relationship when I fell out of the honeymoon phase.

Overall, I know he is a kind, loving, and wonderful person.  The lack in our shared interest and shared attitudes on life is enough to eventually drive us apart though.  As much as I change and bend, he stays stubborn and refuses to make legitimate, lasting compromises with me.  I want nothing more than for him to be happy, and I feel that by ending our relationship I will give him a better chance at happiness than by staying with him and pretending I am happy.  I am not my best self in this relationship, and he deserves someone who is.

I have always been really close friends with all of his girlfriends, and he has always been friends with whoever I have dated. I have not dated anyone in about three years at this point. When Bob first started dating his last girlfriend she began to get a little paranoid that there was more going on between us, so in order to prove to her that nothing was going on he started treating me more like a kid brother. He would tease me  and pick on me like any older brother would do. Eventually, she was comfortable with our friendship. 



However, his “pranks” have not stopped with her comfort. (They have broken up at this point). His “joking around” has gotten to the point of him physically hurting me, and no matter what I say he just plays it off. 



The two main things that he does on a constant basis is grab my fingers and bend them backwards and shove his hands in my face. When he bends my fingers backwards I literally scream because in hurts so much and he thinks its hilarious. One night when we were drinking, he bent my fingers back for so long I was on the verge of tears and I thought he had actually broken my fingers.He also constantly shoves his hands in my face, which mostly results in him actually slapping my face or hitting my nose. He always does this randomly because he thinks it is funny. It has made me very nervous to even sit beside him because I am afraid at any moment he’s going to slap me in the face. He always laughs these off, and he’s never doing these things maliciously, he just genuinely thinks he is just teasing me. 



The most recent time, and the biggest eye opener for me was this New Years. I had too much to drink and I told him I was sick and I wanted to leave, (He was my ride) He reared back and punched me in the stomach and started laughing because he thought I was going to throw up. When we were leaving, I was walking in front of him and he came up behind me and held my arms and squeezed my ribs and stomach because he thought it would be hilarious if I threw up on myself. My ribs were hurting for two days after this.


I let this go, and I was laughing about it the next day and I realized my friend I was telling was not amused and very concerned. The more I tried to defend my friends behavior, the crazier it looked. I do not think my friend is a bad person, I just think he does not realize the extent of how much he physically hurts me. I have noticed he does not do this to any other girl friend of his. I seem to be his little punching bag in a sense. 



I have tried telling him I do not think any of that is funny, and that it hurts and he always says “That doesn’t hurt!” I do not know what to do at this point, because he is a very good friend to me besides this, and I just want to hang out with him without him joking around and hurting me.

Since then, we've been very close and happy.

Recently, I've been becoming more attached to him and wanting more intimacy. He thought that seeing me twice a week was enough and he didn't want to get too serious but I wanted more. I was feeling sad last night and wanted to see him for a little bit as comfort but he told me that he didn't think that seeing him would help me feel better. He had plans to see his friends and told me that we both tend to feel sad after spending a lot of time together and that it wasn't healthy. It hurt me that he wasn't willing to comfort me when I do so much for him and I told him that I thought our relationship was becoming more unequal. I told him last night that I was in love with him and he essentially told me **I like you but I'm not in love. I'm sorry but I care about you and you're one of my best friends. Romance doesn't last forever but I know we'll be in each other's lives beyond that.** I asked him if he saw a future with us and he said no, because he couldn't see the future in general at all.


The kicker is that he's most likely going off to grad school within the next few months so we both knew that there would be an expiration date on our relationship. We both just graduated and while I'm in love with him and would like to plan a future together, he doesn't feel the same way and I honestly don't think I'm mature enough to take a step that big. I would like to keep our relationship casual but my feelings are uncontrollable and so intense because of my inexperience that they make me demand things from him and subsequently make us both unhappy. 

I have realized that I am unhealthily emotionally dependent on him. **Sometimes I question whether I truly love him too because I feel as if I may just be fixating on 'winning' his affection and making him the center of my life as a way to avoid my other problems.** I realize how unhealthy this is, and I'm working on expanding my attention outside of him but I can't seem to stop it. I think about him constantly and plan out time together when I should be focusing on other things.


Should I just scale myself back? Should we break up? I don't know what to do but he's my best friend and we support each other so much in our lives. Although we only meet 2-3 times a week, I see him the most out of all of my friends and feel the closest to him. He's said the same about me and I think this is the major reason why I am so unhealthily dependent on him. Cutting him out of my life would make me feel so empty, alone, and scared. But my emotions get so uncontrollable and make me so unhappy sometimes. Please, I need advice from someone's who's gone through this.

864,2xfb45,"Ok, so heres the story of how I dun goofed.  Last weekend my girlfriend found a photo of a girl we went to highschool with in a bikini on my phone.  Now before you crucify me, just know the photo was a year old and way back in my photo stream, it was sent to me by my friends and I downloaded it so I could zoom in on the boobs.  Let me say it again - this was a year ago and since then I haven't looked at it, I didn't delete it just because I stopped caring about it.  Its not like I wanted to fuck this girl either or anything, I know its cliche to say but it really meant nothing to me, I just wanted to look at her boobs a little more closely once.  
  
So my girlfriend is crushed by this. She has always had a low self esteem and after a year and a half of dating me she felt loved and felt some degree of self worth and after seeing this her self image was brought to record lows.  I feel awful that I did all this and it broke my heart to know that I was responsible for this.  The picture may have been nothing to me but to her things looked very different.  The day that she found out, we worked things out in about an hour, things felt fine for a little bit - we even went to the movies but that night a received a text from her after she had some time to think to herself and things were 10x worse than I thought they were.  This is when it got really bad between us.  She didn't look at me the same way after that.  Prior to this indecent she said I was the man she needed me to be and how I was the last person in the world that she thought would hurt her and now I'm just an immature boy who humiliated her, abused her trust and hurt her worse than anyone else ever has.  
  
It was a rough few days, my guilt was eating away at me and her thoughts of me were getting darker and darker.  Every day she would tell me that she forgave me and then she would take it back the next day after she over thought it some more and decided she was still furious at me until got so frustrated with the roller coaster of emotions that I called her out on it.  This led to her saying something along the lines of no matter how many times I tell you 'I forgive you' just know that its not true and things aren't okay. She eventually accused me of lusting after this girl and wanting to have sex with this girl (from the picture) more than her (my girlfriend).  This actually really offended me, I mean I'm in love with my girlfriend and being accused of feeling otherwise really hurt.  She has told me again and again how even 10 years from now, she will still remember I did this to her even after she forgives me.  It into a shouting battle but things eventually calmed down and that was the night that we sorted it all out (keep in mind this is about 3-4 days after the trigger indecent).
  
Now I've seen her once since then, we saw each other 2 days after we worked it out and things seemed good, great even, she even sent me a few nudes that night which was nice.  After that night out with friends things seemed great between us.  Today is about a week after the fight ended and things are almost back to normal.  We text, we talk on the phone (We go to different universities so thats the best we can do during the week) but something just seems a little off.  The topic of sex is has never been brought up (inb4 OP only cares about the sex - but shut up that's not true) and she seems a little less affectionate.  I know she hasn't totally forgiven me, I know that's going to take a while and I know when she is alone she probably thinks about how I hurt her once in a while.  
  
Now from my point of view, I feel like I wouldn't have gotten as mad at her if the roles were switched, but that's okay, I understand she is in a rough place right now with pressure from family and school.  I am also not one to hold a grudge, just letting something go, forgiving and forgetting is the healthiest option but something tells me maybe my girlfriend isn't as easy going as I am.

368,1kpt23,"So my girlfriend is a year past me in education and she'll be moving away to college at the end of this week while I get ready to start my senior year. We've been struggling with what to do with our relationship while she's away. 

My thoughts on the matter are super conflicted as are hers. When I go to college I don't want to be in a relationship so I wouldn't want to wish that upon someone else. She also doesn't want to be in a relationship but only because she hears from everyone that she shouldn't be. She also doesn't want to try long distance which I totally agree with. But the thing is, we both really like each other. 

There is pretty much nothing wrong with our relationship. It's super easy to talk to her and we lead similarly busy lives so our schedules line up nicely and the sex, well, can't complain :D So the thing that's weird about all of this is that we're breaking up for what feels like no reason. 

We've agreed that when she comes home for breaks and things we'll get together and hook up, but that just seems weird to me. For one, that's built on the stipulation that she doesn't meet someone and neither do I. Additionally, that seems like we're doing a long distance thing but just agree to not technically be in anything while she's away. I don't know how I feel about that. 

A part of me wants to just cut it off completely, but like I said, we still really like each other. From my end, the thing I want for her most is to go to college, meet some awesome people, have the time of her life, and maybe even hook up with other people. The idea of her being with other people really doesn't bother me because when I go to college that is most certainly on my agenda and I really feel like it's unfair to impose restrictions that you wouldn't want on yourself. 

But at the end of the day I just don't know if I should be breaking it off or keeping it somewhat alive and rolling with it until it dies out from natural causes.

434,3c08yp,"So I have been dating my girlfriend for about six months now. I noticed about a month ago it felt like she didn't want to be around me very much. We stopped having sex as much as we used to, and slowly transitioned to not having sex the last two weeks. I got curious... More curious than I should have, and I looked in her phone. 

Then last week, I decided we should talk about why she had been acting so weird, and she dumped me. After what I saw I asked if she cheated, and she said no. The next day she told me she was really hurt I even asked if she cheated. I didn't want to tell her and piss her off (Mostly because I'm stuck living with her until I can find my own place) but I'm feeling so conflicted on what to do. I want to tell her what I saw and get the actual truth. I feel lied to. She's never lied to me before, but I don't know what to think.

The texts I saw were from someone who she had been best friends with for years, and recently moved back into town. They've been hanging out a lot for the last month or so, conveniently right as she started to act differently. What I read was not things you say to someone you're not being intimate with. He would say things like Come over and suck me off and she replied I would have earlier if you asked. Or he would say I want your ass and she'd reply You could have it but Im busy right now. More shit like that. There was one where he mentioned her leaving a mark on his chest/shoulder that made me really suspicious, and another where he said he regretted not playing when she was over that morning. They also say I love you back and forth all the time.

I'm just a fucking wreck over this. We were talking houses and eventual engagement. I thought she was the one, and she shattered my world. We were supposed to spend this weekend together but with the breakup I headed home to my parents. I'm not a person to cry about much... generally the strong silent tough guy type. but I'm sitting here bawling my eyes out about this. Thanks for anyone that replies.

Another weird thing about this is.. I talked to some of her friends and her family about it after the breakup. None of them knew anything about it at all. The only one I didn't talk to was her friend. I'm considering talking to him at some point, but I'm not sure if he'll want to. I'm not angry at him.

TL;DR; GF starts acting weird/cold as she starts hanging out with an old friend more and more, I snoop and find text messages that point to her almost certainly sleeping with him and probably being in love with him.

624,1haru5,"It all started in June 2012 when I started a relationship with, let's call her X. We had a very healthy relationship for the first month, doing new things all the time and moving through the bases at a decent pace. We had genuine feelings for eachother and both had similar interests and likes and both loved eachother.

After the first month my ex girlfriend of 2 years, let's call her Y, started talking to me and was over my house because her mom and my mom are close friends. She managed to steal X's number off my phone and began texting her and attempting to spark jealousy. This was the beginning of the downhill trend of the relationship, and when school started the problem with Y only got worse and me and X were fighting once a week.

It was September and it was my birthday and we spent the entire day with eachother and friends, it was a great day but something different happened. We both went to my car 2 hours before it was time to leave and got downright physical with eachother and since I was her boyfriend everything we did was a first for her, we got to base 3 that night. This was 1 and a half months into the relationship and I regret getting physical, this was a mistake as relationships based off physical actions just do not work if you want a serious one.

In October, she had a job and had less and less time for me, I was lucky to see her once a week and a girl at school I rarely talked to, let's name her Z, noticed I always had my head down so she asked if me and X were doing alright. I had told her about problems with Y and she told me that we could hang out after school and talk about it. 

Big ass mistake.

Obviously X finds out about this, I was up front and told her myself, and obviously hates the fact that I hung out with another girl alone, this is a big NO in a relationship from my experience. This made the downhill trend continue. To skip to December where all the action is about the topic, I will tell you Z and Y fought over me after becoming attracted to me and caused my girlfriend at the time great pain and distrust. All my fault.

It's 3 days from New Years and I end up breaking up with X because she has almost no time for me and frankly I'm tired of feeling like total shit, ignoring how I had been making her feel like shit with these new girls. I end up getting back together with her New Years in a romantic way, flowers and all, because I wronged her and realized she wasn't giving me time because obviously I was treating her like shit.

I did something stupid after getting back with her the next day, involving Z and Y and they slept in the same car with me at the party and X couldn't find me. Obviously this was a huge fuck up and X breaks up with me that weekend.

We talk on/off for 2 months until I realize I need to give her space if I ever want it to work again so I tell her I'm sorry for being clingy and didn't talk to her for 4 months.

Fast forward to June 21'st, I grow the balls to write her an apology letter and physically drop it off at X's house. Y and Z are long gone, Y is going to college and Z and me don't get along. I'm a senior now, X is going to college. She texts me saying thank you for the message and we have a great conversation and catch up.

The next day she states in a text There's gotta be something you wanna ask, anything. I ask Do you still have any feelings for me? She replies I need to make this clear, we are not getting back together I just feel it's not right. I don't want to have a boyfriend right now I'm gonna be in college and I'm gonna be meeting alot of new people and experiencing new things so I need to be open to the whole thing. I apologize and she says it's fine and that it's just not gonna happen.

I don't reply because I'm completely shut down and at this point about to cry, I really missed her and I thought I could work things out. I reply with the lie that I fell asleep and I text her in the morning. She texts back but the whole conversation is me sending paragraph long texts and getting one-word responses, a completely different attitude than the night before. I end up not texting her for a week.

Behind the scenes, I'm talking to her best friend Meghan, getting tips on what to do and getting information from her that X is giving her related to me. She was a big help and genuinely knew I had changed my act between then and now. I was confident I would be able to call X on the 27th and talk to her for the first time in 6 months and sort it out.

The morning of the 27th I receive a text that says I just talked to X and she honestly wants nothing to do with you so my only advice at this point is to just let her go and move on. I say I guess something I said between now and the letter made her do that. (I'm probably right), she says I really couldn't tell ya...she just doesn't want to talk to you. I get mad, don't cuss, just say Yeah whatever and get no reply.

Here I am now, on vacation and miss my ex desperately and know things would be EXTREMELY better this time around. Between December and now I learned not to be physical in relationships, improved my looks at the gym, shut out basically every girl that was intervening with our relationship, got a job, and overall just cleaned up my act and in my opinion am happy with who I am.

- Reddit, I honestly want her back that's my first priority and goal, and I would love suggestions on how to do so.

- Although I want her back, I need to be realistic and understand that not all things are meant to be, so at the same time I'd love encouragement, advice, even step-by-step on getting over her and meeting other girls.

Comment if you need any additional details as I will be checking every hour, many thanks.

1095,2qnkq4,"Throwaway in order to protect the identities of those involved. I am currently engaged to the most wonderful man I have ever met. He is everything I could have ever asked for: kind, charismatic, intelligent, handsome and very successful. Our relationship seemed almost like a fairytale and as if it was too good to be true. However, I have recently been hit with a harsh dose of reality.

My fiance and I were discussing the wedding and the topic of changing my name came up. He was shocked when I told him I wanted to retain my last name as I feel it is a large part of my identity. He went on to state that since his job requires him to be in the public eye, and that portraying a cohesive family unit was important to him, that he wanted me and any future children to have the same last name. I see where he is coming from but I feel as if he is being unreasonable. I offered a compromise of combining our last names and creating a new family name, but he is adamant that he has zero interest in changing his name.

I know this should have been discussed before we got engaged and started planning a wedding, but I never thought he would be so stubborn about this issue. He is everything I could ever ask for in a husband and more, and is willing to compromise on most issues in our relationship, however I am really insulted that he insists that I need to change my last name in order to get married. I will point out that he has been very successful in his career and has a large ego, so I think it might have more to do with that than any of the issues he brought up.

I just don't know what to do, and every one of my friends and family think I am being ridiculous and throwing away the best thing that ever happened to me over a name. Even my parents are advising me to suck it up because everything else about the relationship is perfect. I just don't want to feel like I am his property and if we really are partners then we should be equal in every way, right? I don't think just because he is a man that I should be forced to lose my identity without so much as a compromise from my fiance. I could really use some neutral opinions on this issues as my family and friends seem to think I am being crazy. Should this be a deal-breaker in an otherwise perfect relationship?

EDIT 1: I appreciate the replies from everyone and the words of advice. I think I am being somewhat unreasonable, and the issue of potential children having a hyphenated last name does seem to be a bit impractical. I plan on talking to my fiance and trying to work out a solution.

154,2cwobl,"I'll predate this by saying I'm surprised how I've turned out to be so shallow..

I've been dating the girl for more than a year. She's cute, nice body, little naive (but that comes with age) but otherwise very affectionate, loving, caring, giving much more than receiving. She was a virgin before me and wanted to take it super slow because of past traumatic experience (sexual assault). I didn't mind too much because she was giving me blowjobs at every opportunity, however it eventually got to the point where sex happened. And this is where an otherwise best-I-had relationship took the turn for the worse - her vagina looks ugly. Medically, there is nothing wrong with it, but aesthetically, for me, the lips are way too big. She is very slim so it looks even more disproportionate. Sometimes when she's in underwear I cant even tell if she's wearing a pad or not - it stands out that much. I would rather masturbate to porn than have sex with her. And this is where I face a dilemma:

On the one hand, she's the most caring gf I've had, is head-over-heels in love with me and is trying her best to be a great girlfriend. We never argue, always have common ground and are otherwise a happy couple.

On the other hand I'm not sure it compensates for my lack of sexual desire towards her. I'm just so used to designer-vaginas seen in porn that such a radical deviation is hard to accept.

You find you're incompatible, break up and move on is the logical thing, however I'm worried about her in a sense that: 

I'm her first bf - she has developed very strong emotions towards me - if we don't meet up regularly she becomes very depressed. And when we do she hugs me overnight

has no other emotional support

is starting a stressful career

has a few moderate health problems that manifest under stress


Breaking up would shatter her, I'm sure of it, but its partly her fault for waiting so long to initiate sex and get overly attached in the meantime. My fault for being shallow anyhow, but I see so many beautiful women around, I've got a good career.. it feels like I'd be cheating myself, now that I understood she isn't desirable to me.

I doubt anyone faced these problems but any advice other than telling me I'm immature?

When I first met Jack, he seemed like a nice kid and we share a few similar interests so we've naturally become friends. As of late though, he's been really clingy. He always follows me, sits with me and a whole range of other things. 

As an example, in our Science class, we were asked to pair up with a person and our class is a class of 28 with 12 boys, so each boy had a partner. I partner with another friend, and lo and behold, Jack asks if he can be in a three with me and other friend. I said no as there are an even number of boys and so we should all have a partner. He got really angry and then asked the teacher if he could be in my group and the teacher says yes. I was really annoyed, but whatever, I'll live. 

The next incident happened the other day. One of my friends has won a scholarship to another school, but she asked me to keep it on the down-low. I have exactly one other friend who is aware of the situation and so asked to speak with me in private for more details. Jack, as expected, followed me so I politely told him to go away as this is a private conversation. He got extremely pissed off at this, but after much begging, went away. 20 seconds later, before we could really talk about it, he comes back over and says that we've had enough time to talk.

I went on dates with ~30 women. I'd say out of those about 6 of them I saw more than once. 

I was open to everyone that I was casually dating. In the end I started seeing 3 women, getting to know each of them. One of them we'll call Tiffany called me after the 4th or 5th date and told me I can't see you anymore, you're really sweet and great but you remind me of my ex, and I just can't deal with it.

I didn't know what for and she explained that she felt that she'd hurt me because of the way she'd abruptly broken things off. She went on to explain that she'd dated this other guy for five years and they'd broken up about two or three months before we started seeing one another.

He'd been a really sweet guy but in the end turned into an asshole and had hit her, mentally and verbally abused her etc. She said that even though I'd been nothing but gentlemanly and kind she got really worried.

40,2s7xfo,"Here's the situation, my girlfriend of a year left me for someone on the sports team we were both on while I was taking a semester off to focus on studies. 

Here's some background. I was in a near-sighted relationship last summer for a month with a girl, went back to college, realized how hard distance was with someone I didn't have a solid foundation with, and broke up with her. During this time I had a crush on another girl, but she was in a relationship, so I didn't really have intentions of getting into something with her. Well, then, after the break-up I get close with this other girl. We hit it off and then she confesses her feelings for me and leaves her long distance boyfriend of two years for me. I even tried to keep them together, but I still felt partly responsible.

Now, this made me feel pretty special that someone thought I was so important that they would leave a committed relationship for me. Well, after about two month, I broke up with her because I wasn't really feeling it anymore. Then we got back together. Dated for a couple more weeks, then I broke it off again. We then went on break and I kept away from her, but tried to stay friends. During this time, we grew closer and she popped the question, Do you still have feelings for me? I answered truthfully and we dated until the summer. Beginning of summer, a month and a half in, I break up with her for a day. I don't even know why, I just did. It's like all the information was saying, Date her! She's really good for you! but I wanted out. I immediately regretted my words and we got back together the next day. We dated for the rest of the summer.

During August, we had a large fight and I said some nasty things, but I took some time and thought things over. I ended up talking to her about how I had been wrong, that I had been acting like a child and not completely investing myself, and that I was ready to seriously be in the relationship 100%. Things improved after this and we grew closer. I had finally found what was holding me back, there was honestly a deep part of myself that was scared to say I love you and mean it completely. Everything was starting to make sense and now we could still have good time, still talk about our feelings and what we valued and whatnot, still communicate problems (or so it seemed), still enjoy each other, but it was sweeter for me at this point. 

Beginning of the semester, this new guy from the sports team we were both on tells her that he liked her. She told him she had a boyfriend, but he told her that he was going to continue liking her and flirting because he had to worry about his own happiness. Couple weeks go by and she's listening to the mix tape he made her, so I talk to her that night about if anything was going on. Basically had to pull it out of her that she was developing feelings, but she assures me that she values our relationship and wants it more than anything and that she loves me. So, then a couple weeks later, everything seems to be alright, and I visit her home with her. I get to spend time with her family, see her home town, go shooting with her father, and stay in her house. We talked normally while there, it was our anniversary, so I reminded her how much she means to me and how I had indeed made big changes internally ever sense the summer. That I was so happy with her. 

Two days after that she breaks up with me for this new guy, saying that he said she was the one. She kisses him that night and sleeps there. We talk the next day and stays over. She says she needs time away from both of us. She ends up fucking him the next night (two days after breaking up with me). This crushed me especially that she couldn't even let the dust settle in our relationship before moving on.


It's been 3 months since this all happened. It's been rough because it's just so goddamn hard to know what to feel anymore and to let go of the person she seemed to be. I mean, we were really good friends while we dated. That and she and the guy she left me for are on the sports team that I'm returning to this semester, so that's just fucked. I've talked to other women, and no connection seems to look good for more than a few days. Help me out. I just don't know why someone would work so hard for me just to end it like this or how she could just turn off her feelings for me like that.

**tl;dr**: How do I move on from the pain from my last relationship while I'm on a sports team with my ex and the guy she left me for?

Update: Thanks everyone who said something. It's more of the same I've been hearing, so I guess I just need reminders every now and then, and to actually listen. I think I'm staying on the team, but I'll keep my head up and continue to put myself out there. I don't mean to whine and then not do anything about the problem, but I've been on this team since I started college, I'm arguably the best at what I do for the team, and I can't run away from what I enjoy just because someone else broke my heart. I just need to accept that she isn't someone that deserves to be in my life anymore, not in a mean way, but for my own good.","My [21M] girlfriend [20F] of 1 year left me for another guy, it's been a couple months and I'm still confused/trying to move on.",0,False,2,8,1421105168,/r/relationships/comments/2s7xfo/my_21m_girlfriend_20f_of_1_year_left_me_for/,Romantic

I thought this was the girl I was going to marry, we lived together and shared so many life events and experiences. I trusted her with everything and we would have done anything for each other.




About two or three months before it ended, things were rocky, we were both very stressed out and we ended upfighting frequently. She met someone else at work and they became close. Some one who she could have fun with and not have the fights of a serious relationship. She left me for this guy.




About two months after our break up and NC ,she asked if we could talk. I wanted to hear what she had to say, inhopes of closer, so we met up. She basically said to me that I am the love of her life but she didn't want to be with me since she had feelings for someone else. She said she had left because she didn't want to cheat on me and that she didn't want to hurt me. She said that she doesn't want to be with the person that she wants to marry because she is too young to think of that at the moment. I hate seeing her with him. And I feel like she said those things to me because she doesn't want me to stop loving her, she wants me to be there like always, but she doesn't want to take care of me any more. Am I suppose to wait for her to come back?




I cry every night, I wake up so depressed. I want her to be with me, I want our love back. I don't understand why she doesn't want to work on things with me instead of being with another guy. It hurts so much to know that she moved on so quickly and can have feelings for someone else when all I can think about is her and how things used to be. I can't get her out of my head no matter what I do. I miss our jokes and waking up next to her and sharing meals with her. Everything I do reminds me of her, how can she be with someone else and not think about me? I am just so sad and feel so low. I feel so worthless

981,25twdc,"My boyfriend (let's call him Gary) of over a month came to visit me and my friends today for the first time. He lives in NYC and I in Jersey, so normally I come up to visit him. However, my best friend we'll call him Will), who is a guy, was having a small gathering and invited my boyfriend I along. I was excited for them to finally meet.

However...things didn't go well. Gary is naturally curious and asks a lot of questions. He's always well dressed because that's what he's most comfortable in. He sometimes makes jabbing or sarcastic jokes but never is out to hurt anyone. Sometimes he can have a bit of an air of superiority but he's a sweetheart and kind underneath that exterior when he opens up to someone. Will, on the other hand, is a bit poor, is quiet and has mental issues like I do, and is brutally honest to the point he intentionally hurts me to get me to change my ways for the better.

When Gary went off for a bit, Will told me how he thought my boyfriend was annoying, pretentious, and conceited. It really hurt me to hear my boyfriend trashed like that, because he's really misunderstood and is the most incredible person to me (who else would make me breakfast and tea when I'm sick and hold me through a BPD episode?), but I smiled and laughed to hide my frustration. Will made us sleep outside until his mother came and yelled at him to let us sleep in the guest room. That really pissed Gary off.

In the morning after Gary left for the train back home, Will began to gush to me how he thought Will was a rich snob, that he only dresses well to come off as superior, and that he was a total douchebag. I didn't have much to say except that I know he's a good person but I'm one of the few he is comfortable to open up to and show his vulnerability. Still, it fucking bothered me that he was talking about Gary like that - it hurt me. Will went on to ramble about how I have a shit choice in men, I'm stupid, and only care about money. What the fuck? None of that is true. I also NEVER trashed on his ditzy girlfriend and am nothing but supportive of their relationship (even though the chick bails on him all the time and ignores him a lot). Now he told me he doesn't want to hear me talk about Gary and to never bring him around again. Gary is upset Will doesn't like him, because he was only trying to be funny and himself but Will misconstrued it all as him trying to be an asshole which is the exact opposite of what he meant.

My friend is always brutally honest and I know he cares about me so much, but I'm tired of him putting down the people who make me happy and whom he judges so quickly. It wears me out and makes me feel like I'm doing something wrong ALWAYS or I'm wrong for getting attached to someone.

Why does this bother me so much? Should I do anything or let it go? Am I overreacting?

790,1tfgtp,"I'm a male 22-year-old college student. I work with a girl (age 20) who I've been interested in for a couple months, but I can't tell if she's interested in me at all, or not interested for that matter. It's a bit of a mystery. We've been working in the same shift for the past couple months, and have had some good, enjoyable conversations. She's pretty, enjoyable to be around, and gets a fair amount of attention from guys. She is, however, single.

With the Christmas break, a bunch of her roommates and friends have gone home, while she is still stuck in our college town so that she can keep working. She's mentioned being bored and not having people to hang out with or things to do-- it's a fairly small college town, and most of the good things to do aren't good right now because it's too cold. 

Early this week, we traded phone numbers, with us agreeing that we should hang out sometime. On Friday morning, I sent her a text message, asking if she was up to anything on Saturday afternoon. She responded by saying she had friends coming into town, but counter-offered with the possibility of going to a movie that night. I met her at the theater because she was coming from work, and I had gone in early that day.

We went and saw Frozen. Nothing really happened-- I bumped her elbow on the armrest with my hand a couple times, but there was no reaction-- she didn't seem to be rejecting the idea, but she definitely wasn't going for it either. The night was definitely inconclusive, but I did pay for her ticket, say that I had a good time, and suggest that we go out again sometime when we left the theater. All in all, I remained in the same boat of not knowing if she's interested in me or not.

Today, after looking at her facebook profile, I saw a picture with her twitter handle on it. I looked it up (this is probably an invasion of her privacy) and saw that she today (the day after the movie) tweeted I accidentally went on a date last night. How that happens? Who knows. Is the fact that the date was an accident a clue that she might not be interested? Could it possibly be a happy accident? Does it mean anything? Am I overthinking this?

---------------------------------


Just need to air this out for some unbiased opinons. Thanks for your thoughts

My SO has an overly attached EX [f34] who never got over their breakup which happened years before me and SO got together. THE EX has been involving herself into his new relationships, trying to be besties with the new lady, constantly turning up and reminding everyone about her strong bond with my SO, calling SO her older brother and best friend - you get the idea. It felt that it was too much and told her (in agreement with SO) after a while of observing and in a respectful manner that she needs to respect certain boundaries. She blew it completely out of proportion and it caused drama in this social circle. It was interpreted as me forbidding their friendship (nope, just asked for boundaries) and of course I was stamped down as a bitch. I didn't care, it had the wished effect (i.e. no more sob calls at 3AM in the morning from her). My SO wasn't too bothered because he hadn't been in contact with the people in the circle anyways for a while, except for his best friend.

This best friend, OKAN [m, 38] is getting married to THE EX's best friend HATICE [f,35] in a few weeks. I am neither hot nor cold with HATICE. I've invited her a couple of times to come hang out in group settings, she always had an excuse which is fair enough. I've seen her a few times, never really got warm with her but I don't mind her either. So there's no negativity. I'm more in touch with OKAN who I socialized with quite often and who would come alone to parties and social gatherings that both of them were invited to. I respect that HATICE follows some sort of girlfriend code and I'm not questioning that at all.

About two months ago I had a chance to talk with OKAN about his wedding and I told him elegantly and tactfully, that he doesn't have to worry about drama at the wedding. I conveyed to him that I am not a fan of weddings, that the event will be shortly before my due date and that I would gladly send my SO on his own unless they would see this as a big insult. So I think I gave OKAN a pretty clear way out of the situation and I'm pretty certain he understood that I was giving him and HATICE a Get Out of Jail Free card. 

About a week ago THE EX calls my SO, tells him she's pregnant and getting married and then and asks him if he was coming to OKAN's and HATICE's wedding. She said she only asks to avoid any awkwardness at the event. Knowing her it was to rub it in and because she loves drama. Sadly, this is how my SO found out that he wasn't invited to his best mates wedding. 

My SO called OKAN right after THE EX called him and straight up asked what's with the wedding and OKAN just wound himself around the subject and said that everything is very chaotic and there would be no stagnight either. 

When my SO told me,  he acted cool like most men would and as if he was glad he didn't have to squeeze himself into a suit. I sensed though it confused if not upset him - one indication was that he got really wasted that night, something he only does when he is very upset. I carefully asked him if he was upset and he just said it might be his own fault after all he hadn't spoken with OKAN in nearly six weeks (due to us moving an having tremendous stress ourselves). 

My SO is going to continue acting as if he isn't bothered. Meanwhile I'm boiling inside because it is so unfair to him. I've got a good connection with OKAN and I'm wondering if I should say something to him about this?

She fails about a third of the classes she takes and recently decided she wants to be a teacher. Problem is she can't pass the required classes or tests to do it. It may make me a dick but I recently told her I don't think teaching would be the best profession for her. Turned into an argument and I told her if I ever have kids I wouldn't want someone who can't pass 1/3 of her classes teaching them. Anyway I am ready to move forward with my life and save up for a house and settle down but I'm realizing how difficult this will be as she continues to add on to student loans. I am just tired of waiting for her to figure life out. I don't want to have to take care of her financially my entire life and she has yet be even be able to help pay rent.

1106,2iv1bs,"My GF and I have been dating for close to 4 months.  Things were wonderful in the beginning.  We work near each other and eat lunch almost every day together.  At night we have been spending a lot of time together as well.  I usually stay over at her house just about every night.  She tells me she loves having me there so I did not see an issue.  In the past couple weeks she seems to be texting less, telling me that she doesn't want to be connected to her phone constantly.  She does not express her feelings as much as she did at first and she is seemingly less interested.  


The other day she expressed to me that if I give her a back rub, she would return the favor with a BJ.  So I happily agreed and did my deed for her.  After about 20 minutes of giving her an awesome back rub we stop and I get ready for bed.  While laying there she teased me a little and then pulls away and says she is tired.  This is when my issues began to come up.  I began thinking, not that I cared that much about get my rocks off, but instead does she really not care about my needs.  She tried kissing me and grabbing me with a sense of sorry I'm tired and I love you. But I still felt so unhappy that she didn't care to return a favor.  


The next morning she could tell I was upset, I mean I was.. again not because I didn't get a BJ but because I do everything she asks and if there is one thing that she offers, she didn't even fulfill her end. In the car to work I brought up that I was concerned I do to much.  She got a little upset and said that she was annoyed that I worry about our relationship so much. She then said that we need to do our own thing sometimes.  Which to me was saying okay, I want time away from you.. I promptly told her Okay, I'll back off.  


Later she apologized and told me not to take it the wrong way and that she loved me.  She just feels like she doesn't have a chance to miss me because we are always together. 


Yesterday I dropped her off at her house, left and went home.  Did my things, and worked out.  During this time she didn't text me once. Not until about 7 at night. Even after that text was she barely talking to me, just random text here and there.  I ended up getting an extreme panic attack, I'm realizing I'm being a needy bitch and its making me mad at myself, mostly because I have never felt that way with anyone in my past.  My feelings end up taking over and I eventually said something to her about her being different lately.  This prompted a little fight in which I ended up apologizing for because I was really being stupid.  She tells me that I always make her feel bad about not spending time with her.  I have to admit I do, my anxiety creeps in on me and takes over to the point where If I keep doing this stuff, I will in no doubt ruin the great attraction she has for me.  


I talked to her on the phone last night and she seemed understanding, I told her that I would not make her feel bad about things anymore.  I truly wish she was obsessed with me sometimes.  I wish that I would be in the position of control and not her. I feel like I'm fucking this relationship up, but I do not know what steps to do to fix it.  I've been reading books like No More, Mr. Nice Guy and reading articles online.  I've even kept a small journal of my feelings.. Nothing is helping and I've hit rock bottom.  I'm going to see the Doctor on Monday about my anxiety and his advice on talking to someone, but I feel like a joke of mankind.


Today we have been talking a little, I will not see her today for lunch, and she told me that she is going out with girlfriends tonight.  I'm trying everything I can to not be nervous about her going out.  My concern is that she will go out with the girls, they will then meet up with guys and continue.  All of which I will be the annoying boyfriend that is making her feel bad about not spending time with her.

The only thing is that I feel like i want more experience. She was my first gf and i want to know whats it like to meet someone else. Also, we don't have a lot to talk about. The only things we have in common are the tv shows and movies we like and we always watch something together but when it comes time to have a conversation... nada. A great relationship shouldnt be like that and i want to be able to have fun with my gf. And today she was telling me about her day and i just couldn't care less. It may make me seem like an dick but its how i felt. Now let me get to the problem (the other problem).

Carly's home life is terrible. She is poor. Not trying to be mean but her parents just don't make that much money and things are so tight that there isn't even much food in the house when i go over. Also, her parents always yell at her because they are stressed. This makes her miserable and she cries all the time. Carly's parents are immigrants from Colombia and are in danger of losing their home and have considered in the past to go back to Colombia. 

But Carly's whole life is here and id be the only way for her to stay (they have no relatives or close friends here). Carly also suffers from chronic body pain. Has nothing to do with me but is also something she deals with. Carly also loves my family. I have a wonderfully large family and she absolutely adores coming to family holidays and such calling my mom mom and everything like that.

Now she loves me so so so sooo much and always tells me so. I have broken up with her once before and it was the most awkward thing ever. And because I'm a dumbass i keep getting back together with her which i know is going to hurt her in the end because i don't see a future together. I don.t want to marry this girl. So I'm always thinking about how we have an expiration date. I'm just afraid ill be ruining her life. She has been fighting depression for the past year and a half and only started getting better this past summer.

We are in very different financial states currently (I am struggling to keep up with school but he has a lot more freedom) and we are planning to move in together in the summer. The relationship is amazing and I am very excited for our future together.



However, at the beginning of our relationship he did mention his future plans to travel with his best friends. I immediately had a weird feeling because I knew I really liked him but obviously it was way too early to say anything about it.



He is planning to go across the ocean to Europe for one month with his best friends in the fall, shortly after we get our apartment together (he doesn't mind paying rent for the month he's gone). I will be stuck home in school while he is having the time of his life. Yes, I will absolutely miss him so that is one thing - but I also feel sad that I will miss out on the experience. I know I can't ask him to not go - he has been planning this for longer than we have been together - but I can't help but feel upset about it right now.



I know it sounds pretty selfish, but I have this vision in my head of traveling with him. There is nothing I want more in my life right now than to be able to travel the world, but unfortunately I am not in a place in my life I can do that. When I think about traveling in the future, I see myself doing it with him. I can honestly see myself spending the rest of my life with him, and the shared experience of traveling is so important to me. We have talked about it and he knows that it upsets me that we can't go together. But he is still going.



He has addressed my worries and assures me that he will be excited to come home to me and that one month isn't such a long time. As far as the shared experience, he says we can always travel together in the future still. But it just doesn't seem the same to me.



Am I crazy for believing that traveling is incredibly life-changing and eye opening? Am I crazy for wanting to share the experiences so we can be on the same level? I know that it is completely unrealistic to ask him to not go on this trip with his friends, I know it will be an amazing experience for him, but I can't help feeling like this could destroy an otherwise perfect relationship. I know this isn't him traveling without me, but rather the value I have placed on traveling together in my head. And I know it is irrational to be upset with him for following through with plans he made before we were together - but I feel hurt that he never asked me about it and just made the decision without me.

We [both very similar introverts] met on Tinder, and have both since deleted the app. We've hung out a lot, fooled around, talked for hours, been on incredibly fun dates, driven around aimlessly like best friends, made each other laugh over and over and over and over again.


She has opened my eyes to a lot -- great music and TV, feminism, different crafts, and just general loveliness.


I'm smart, funny and witty, but I genuinely believe she is smarter, funnier and wittier. I love that about her. We communicate incredibly well, and have close to 6000 facebook messages back and forward over 3 weeks.


I sent her a nice email [a long collection of properly drafted thoughts] about how much I like her, and she really dug it and reciprocated, which is cool. But I was holding back...


**The problem** is a bit circular. Basically:

* (a) I feel incredibly strongly about her, and find her so attractive
* (b) It's quite soon to go into things as deeply as I want to, therefore
* (c) I feel like I'm holding back [being dishonest, in a way], therefore
* (d) I'm hesitant to be too physical [while I'm holding back], therefore
* (e) I feel like I'm giving her really mixed messages, even though (a)


I have no trouble telling her how attracted I am to everything about her, and how I feel like I've known her forever [mutual]. But when I can tell that she is definitely angling to make out, I get trapped in my mind and keep coming back to (c) and (d), which are kind of a joint mental road block. 


I feel like we need to hang out more before I can start talking about how I think I might be falling for her, but, the more trapped in my mind and over-analysis I become, the more I risk giving off mixed messages and her rightfully nope-ing out. We're both introverts, so she definitely gets it to a degree, but I'm anxious that there's only so much someone can 'get it'.


As I say, we have fooled around, but we had been drinking a little bit that night. Drinking does help me get out of my mind, but I also don't want to become the person that will only fool around drunk.


**TL;DR:** We both feel like there is an incredible amount of potential, but I am worried about blowing it one of two ways. The first is by being honest too soon, and the second is by not being honest soon enough. In as much as anything is wrong, it's definitely on my end. I feel like the right person for me has come along, and I might be blowing it slowly but surely.


I get a big buzz from healthy and respectful relationships, and I feel like this could work out really awesomely for both of us if I can just get over myself. But that involves walking a very fine line, which I am scared of doing at this point in time.

When she left this happened 
-She goes off to college, meets tons of people.
-she still constantly tells me she loves me and is still needy and I'm still slaving as her boyfriend, I also visit her often but we technically aren't dating by her definition
- she has sex with a guy while drunk and actually tells me on my birthday, which sucked, but I agreed it wasn't cheating despite how I'm a relationship we were. 
-the next weekend she decides she really wants to be my girlfriend.
-I'm shaken because her having sex was pretty hurtful considering I'm extremely loyal even then when we weren't technically dating.
-I finally agree an were them a couple.
-I visit her and everything is cool, of course I hate hearing about the guys she hangs out with..... Alone. Is that okay?
-anyway, we go to a party and long story short she gets drunk and basically ditches me saying she wants to have fun and be wild and flirts/touches other guys the whole night. I sit there miserably and the next morning I break up with her and leave
- I see her thanksgiving and we do have sex but it isn't good and of course she's constantly texting or snapchatting other  guys one of which I found out she smoke with (which is unheard of for her) and they tried to have sex but apparently he couldn't get it up..

Since I'm still in high school there are times when I don't do big assignments (senior slide) and my parents find out and punish me. The punishment this time was banning me from prom (we were going to go together) and taking my phone away. Right when I received this punishment, my mom told me to text my ex that I was not going to prom and that I wouldn't have my phone but she could still contact me on Facebook and we could carry on with our relationship on there until I get my phone back. (Which basically means no phone calls or skype until I get my phone back).
At this point, I go and do the big assignment for around 2 hours. Afterwards, I jump onto Facebook to see that she no longer has me in a relationship with her. I ask her So I assume you broke up with me? And she replies Of course I ended it, YOU FUCKING CHEATED ON ME YOU ASSHOLE

I have no clue what she is talking about so I tell her I didn't cheat on you. She never replies, so I assume this is just her way of breaking up with me but making herself the victim. 2 days later, I message her again basically asking her to explain to me why she thought I was cheating on her, to which she replied that when we have time to talk she is going to tell me her side of the story in hopes that I tell her my side of the story.

I will be getting her message in approximately 2 hours, I'm sure I can explain to her how ludicrous her side of the story is (because I didn't fucking cheat on her) but even then I'm not sure I want to continue the relationship with her. I don't think it's right of her to take advantage of my situation and use it to shame me, and honestly I don't think any normal person would jump to conclusions that fast.

To preface all of this: apart from last weekend we are pretty lovey doves (3 phone calls a day, 1 skype chat). Something happened over the weekend (her side, not mine) she would take 5 hours to text me back, didn't pick up my phone calls, and ditched our skype session. Her mom also told me she didn't come home one of the nights. This is why I thought she lost interest in me and was using my situation to break up with me.

I've been dating my BF for 3 years. At first we had some pretty unhealthy behaviors (dirty fighting, manipulating, playing games). We've grown out of that together and it's been great for the past 1.5 years.

Lately, I've found we have the same argument over and over. When he is convinced he is 100% correct on a topic, there's no having a discussion about it at all. Sometimes it's motivations for the things I do. Other times it's as stupid as deciding whether to take a certain trip somewhere or not. He's so stubborn and refuses to even talk, ignoring my messages and calls outright.
In all other departments he's super sweet and caring and understanding.

They don't even bug me often, just the occasional phone call since I've moved to the other side of the country. 

I know a lot of folks would probably say that I'm being selfish and a 10 minute phone call every couple months is a small price to pay for folks who cared for me and provided a good life for me for many years. And while I can't dispute the logic in that, the reason I find it so difficult is that I'm not really a person who gets a lot out of life. Call it chronic depression, pessimistic worldview, general misanthropy, whatever. But I find it hard to be thankful for something that I never asked for and don't really enjoy.

Ever since then, however, he's finished pretty quickly every time. I haven't been able to get off during sex for the past three months, because he beats me to it and is so sensitive afterwards that he can't start up again for at least a few hours (there is no round two with him). He's noticed it too (I didn't bring it up!), and has said he wants to figure out what's causing this.

To shortly sum it up, she is a sweet, nice girl who had bad things happen to her in her life (PTSD) and now suffers from depression and eating disorder. Not manipulative in any way, which is why I feel safe talking to her openly. I suffer from depression and anxiety myself. We basically talked about our experiences all night long and she told me stuff she didn't even tell her therapist. At the end I felt like I needed to tell her that I kind of always had a thing for her out of respect just for that talk we had that night and that she has to know that after this talk I am kind of falling for her. Which is a huge thing for me, since anxiety and fear of rejection and all.

She said she isn't in love with me or anything, but she definitely has never expierenced something like this and is not sure what she feels yet. I can dig that, I feel similiar. It's kind of like I want there to be something between us simply because we are able to talk that openly with each other and at least the sexual attraction is there from my side (don't know about her, but I'm not bad looking by any means). We talked some more and held hands after that and since it is 5 am in the morning here I went to bed while she went to shower and then to bed (sleeps at my roomate who is her friend), I hugged her good night.

1093,1ycc7d,"So, a few weeks ago, I asked a boy that I have had a crush on for several years out on a date. We go to a small university, so we have lots of mutual friends and have been casual aquaintences for a long time, but never really became close friends since we were both so shy. However, this semester I have seen more of him than I usually do. We run into one another a lot at the gym, we've hung out with mutual friends a few times, I see him around at events and such. He and I have had a couple of really great, long conversations recently, and I started to think there was a strong possibility that he maybe liked me too.

I succumbed to the peer pressure of friends and asked him on a date a few weeks ago. I had high hopes for it and had everything planned out, but unfortunately we got snowed in so he just came over and I prepared dinner and we talked for several hours instead. I felt like it went really well, but it is possible that he just didn't feel the chemistry I thought was there. 

After not hearing anything from him, I texted him last wednesday asking if he'd be interested in joining me for dinner again. He did not reply, but when I ran into him later he apologized for not getting back to me, but said he'd love to but wasn't sure when he would be free. I told him to just let me know, he said he would. Now, though, I still have not heard from him apart from a 30 second conversation in the gym.

It is clear to me that he is not interested. Whatever, that is fine. But when I asked him out, I was very optimistic that worst case scenario, we would end up friends. We have all of the same passions, interests, and social circle. We are very similar in our ideologies and motivations. We are even similar in out downright weird traits haha. I figured that with how well the date went, there would be no way for us not to be friends.

I am kicking myself now. Asking him on a date like that was very uncharacteristic for me. I should have just built the stronger friendship first, instead of making it awkward now. So, reddit, I guess I want to know what I should do to fix this. I have two options that come to mind.

Option 1: Ignore him completely. Do my own thing for about a month or so, ignore him when we are around each other with our friends and at events, just pretend like he's not there. That's pretty much what I've been doing the past 2 weeks as to not push him away with making my interest to clear. In about a month or so, hopefully he'll have forgotten I ever seemed interested in him, so talking to him in order to become friends will become less awkward. 

Option 2: Be honest with him and just say something along the lines of Hey, so, I know you're not really interested in a second date, but I just sort of wanted to sah that I'd still like to get to know you better as a friend. Sorry I asked you on that date a few weeks ago so out of the blue.

I am around this person a lot because, again, same social circle at a super tiny university. That much is unavoidable. I would like for there to be as little awkwardness as possible. I just kind of want to clear the air and make it known that he doesn't need to be so uncomfortable just because I have a crush. I really had just wantwd to go on that date in order to sort of break the ice for dating, friendship, whatever. I would have liked to have dated him, sure. But ultimately, I just really wanted to get to know him so we could be friends. Now its just awkward and I hate it.

1111,2g5jo4,"My boyfriend is wonderful, and I really love him a lot. This post isn't about any problem in our relationship, which is so good. We communicate really well. Long may that continue. 

My question is about a boy that I knew two years before I ever met my boyfriend, Vince (who is now 20). We were never in a relationship, but we had a small summer fling (no romance or dates, just going to his house and watching movies, driving around, that kind of thing) for about two weeks and slept together a couple of times after that ended. The only reason anyone would consider our relationship important is that I lost my virginity to him. (Not because I wanted to lose it with him particularly, but because I was just curious about sex and wanted to have it.) 

Since then we have barely spoken, not for any reason other than he has been busy with work, I've been busy with school, and we have both since had proper, serious relationships with other people. We had a small catch up now and then (maybe every month?) in a platonic, friendly way until I had a brief relationship with a man who was quite jealous and forced me to delete, block, stop talking to, abandon all friendship with Vince etc etc. 

After that I didn't speak to Vince at all, didn't have his number and didn't have him on Facebook, which I rarely used anyway. Life moved on and I started up with my boyfriend, who is amazing. 

Vince added me on Facebook a little while ago and I accepted (it's been so long since I've thought of him as anything but an acquaintance that I caught up with now and then that I didn't think anything of it, but in hindsight it was probably a mistake because of our history). I didn't hear from him via message or anything until today. We had a short catch-up conversation, and he expressed desire to text occasionally and to maybe come round and watch bad TV like he used to. 

If this was an ordinary friend guy, I wouldn't think much of this. However, I don't know whether it is presumptuous of me to think that he might try to initiate sex with me if we met up, because while we've talked and caught up now and then we haven't physically seen each other since we were sleeping together. He also mentioned he hasn't gone on a date or slept with anyone or anything in a long time, in passing. I wouldn't mind being *very* casually friends with Vince, as we had a lot in common and similar senses of humour at one time at least, but I don't want it to even touch on becoming more than that because I love my boyfriend and am not one bit interested in starting up with Vince again. 

Our conversation was entirely platonic and I mentioned how good my relationship with my boyfriend is. I haven't done anything wrong, but I still have a nagging feeling that I shouldn't have talked to him. My boyfriend would never try to prevent me from talking to anyone, or ask me to cut someone out. He considers that to be excessive jealousy and controlling behaviour. Personally I'd see it as reasonable for him or any boyfriend in his situation to ask me not to talk to Vince but he wouldn't agree. However I think that he would be privately upset if we talked more; the single feeling that he isn't honest with me about is jealousy, as he feels a lot of jealousy with me but tries to hide it so I don't think that he is being controlling. (I wouldn't think anything of the sort if he did express it reasonably, as I understand that jealousy happens.) The fact that I talked to Vince is by no means a secret that I am keeping from my boyfriend.

So is it okay for me to be friends with Vince considering that, in my camp at least, any spark we had as kids has died? Or should I stop this before it goes any further for my boyfriend's sake, or because I feel weird about it? What would you do if this was your girlfriend?

Edit: I wouldn't be upset if Vince and I ceased to talk because he doesn't mean anything to me. It's a case of if it upsets my boyfriend, no way am I talking to Vince, if my boyfriend doesn't care, then well I have one more extremely casual acquaintance. My question isn't framed around my burning urge to talk to/see Vince, it's framed around, could anyone reasonably expect their boyfriend to be fine with it or would it be a bad-girlfriend thing to even consider?

1186,2mjbk8,"Hi guys.


I will try to keep this short and sweet, but would like to add as much backstory as possible so I can get fair answers.

My fiancé and I got engaged back in June. I grew up in a state just south of the one I live in now with my future husband.
 
I still keep in touch with a few very close friends who live in my home state, California.  Two of my oldest and closest friends from there became boyfriend and girlfriend about a year or two ago. It's been very neat seeing two of my best friends become two very good partners to each other. Since they are the focal point of this post, I will call the girl Patty and the boy Pete.

Where I live now has become a bit of a visiting hot spot, as it is a very fun and beautiful town. One of my other childhood friends, Lisa, who is also friends with patty and pete friends moved up here just about a year after I did,  and my brother moved up about 6 months ago.

Anyway, about a few weeks after my amazing fiance and I got engaged in June, we set a date. We chose the date July 18th 2015 and have been booking things already. It is set to be here where we live and met (NOT my home-state) 
 
Patty and I became good friend in freshman year of high school, nearly 11 years ago. Patty is an only child and I've known her to have some very selfish, only child-ish moments but I've always looked past them because she is a fun and good friend. 
She is going to be a bridesmaid in my wedding (along with Lisa) and that has always been common knowledge. I just recently made a personalized card that I will be mailing to her to formally ask her to be a bridesmaid and tell her how much I cherish our friendhsip.
 I didn't want to assume or take advantage of the fact that she'd be a bridesmaid because we've been friends for 11 years and I wanted to give it a more personal touch. 

Pete and I have known one another since I was in 4th grade. He's been my older brothers best friend since they were in middle school and Pete and I maintained a relationship of our own along with him being friends with my brother (we've always had a platonic relationship). Him and I have done a lot of amazing things together and have some very awesome memories.


Anyway, on to the problem! 

Patty and Pete got engaged a week ago. I am so so so happy for them! I asked Patty the usual engagement questions- how he proposed, if they have a date picked, etc. When I asked her the date question she kinda changed the subject and I let it go until we chatted again tonight. I asked her again if they started to think about dates (I had a bad feeling at this point). She answered me this time and told me, yes, they were thinking about June 21st 2015.

June 21st!! Less than 3 weeks before my own wedding. IN A DIFFERENT STATE! I know Patty, and she is going to want me to be involved in her bachelorette party, bridal shower, wedding day-- THE WORKS.  Not to mention Lisa too.

I am having a VERY 'do it yourself' wedding to save on my tight budget and also because we're getting married at a  family members ranch--not an actual wedding venue.
 She knows this. 
On top of all the work I will be doing in the month or two preceding my wedding, there is no way in hell I'll be able to take off my own weekend for my bachelorette party (really all I want is a fun weekend with my best girlfriends), a few days before the wedding to help set up the ranch, the actual wedding day, and then a week for the honeymoon...

On top of not being able to take off that much work in 3 weeks time, I just plain won't have money to fly myself down to my home state, buy a bridesmaids dress, buy a wedding gift, help throw a bachelorette party and then fly myself back right before my wedding. I'm already pinching every single penny I have just so my future husband and I will be able to take a trip longer than 3 days together (never had a real vacation together, our money is always very tight ) and call it a honeymoon .


I know that I cannot ask her to change her wedding date and I do not plan to. But, reddit, help me!!! 

I can just see this now turning into her thinking I'm an AWFUL and selfish  friend who doesn't care about her. Plus knowing them (they travel for months at a time.. actually in a foreign country for 3 months right now) they'll be on honeymoon right after the wedding and will probably even miss mine, or at least the pre wedding shenanigans that I've always pictured her at. It would break my heart not to be apart of her wedding, but I simply cannot be what I'd want to be for her just 3 weeks before mine...And it would also break my heart not to have her and Pete at mine!

If roles were reversed, I would never in a million years schedule my wedding as close to hers. My eyes are really opening up to how selfish they've become recently, but I wont go into that.

What do I do? Tell her how happy I am for her and him but that I won't be able to be involved with such a close date to mine( im sure she'll want me as bridesmaid if not maid of honor) ? Do I just keep my mouth shut ??

These people are not idiots, in fact they are very smart. They have to know that scheduling their wedding weeks away from mine in a totally different state while being apart of the wedding party, sharing some very mutual and close friends (in my state) is a very selfish thing to do??  

I can see this ruining our friendship, not by my choice but hers. I do not want to lose two long time friends.

Am I just being a bridezilla (God I hope not, I never ever ever wanted to be one!!)??

Here in the country where we live entering in the college is different from the US.


Universities do an annual test, which the content is basically everything we studied in all our years of school and high school plus more. It's really an unfair and cruel system.


The competition is crazy. Entering Medical School in the public system is almost impossible. My girlfriend is trying med school for FOUR years straight. And the failure is consuming her.


It is affecting every single aspect of her life, even our relationship. We don't see each other very often anymore, because the tests started a month ago. However, the tests are not the problem. 


She's distant, like never before. She's not being nice with me and says I'm not helping her. Even though I'm doing my very best to make her a little less upset.


She said she's tired of our relationship, but she also swears she loves me endlessly, i did break up with her twice even loving her because of her studies, but I'm not sure i believe in her love anymore. This last 6 months we barely did sex, she barely talks about how much she wants me to see her or to do anything else in my company...


I'm completely hopeless. She's unhappy and it feels she's just with me because she's afraid of being alone. I don't know what to do anymore. How can i help her if she prefers to be alone instead of being with me?

599,3ddcma,"It should be clarified that we are a bisexual couple (**both male**) who have kept our relationship a secret because we are both still closeted. I honestly can't approach any of my friends or family, which is why I'm here.


For the first 7 months our relationship was fantastic, we were perfect for each other (equally ambitious, selfless, etc.). We had met on a gay social networking app, which is important for one reason. I had some childhood issues as a kid (sexual abuse) and sometimes I would seek attention (physical). So I decided one day to get back on that app, post a picture and get attention, be it compliments or what have you. He created a fake profile on that app and baited me into cheating on him. Responsibility all mine - I've learned my lesson. Attempting to cheat and actually cheating are one and the same. We've since addressed the underlying issues (not professional, just a very lengthy talk).


His parents are divorced and his last relationship of 4 months ended up with him getting cheated on, which is why cheating is his deal-breaker. And after this incident, we decided to make amends after a week of no-contact with certain conditions I suggested (he has complete access to my social media/email accounts and can find my phones location at his discretion to check up on me; and that we both communicate our feelings more openly and honesty). He even said he genuinely felt we're perfectly capable of rebuilding for the better.

Everything thus far went back to normal, our usual selves. A few weeks or so after we make amends, he suddenly shows up to my house and confesses that the heartbreak I caused has creeped back and decided to end the relationship - yet he still remained inside my house. I asked him to leave, but he didn't want to and said to me If I can't have you I don't want anyone else. So we make amends... again. Now we're back to normal (happy, all smiles, going out to eat, etc.).

As the weeks progress, his feelings of hurt and the feeling of heartbreak has become less intense and frequent - he's even said they've improved. Of course the healing process doesn't happen overnight, and we talk about his feelings every now and then, though a lot less often. Just a few days ago, we were talking about it in person, he wanted to end the relationship - I asked him do you want to end it right now? I can get out and walk home he said no. I explained to him that there was something that still kept us together, even in spite of all of this. That *something*, I exclaimed, was his willingness to forgive by giving the relationship a second chance. AGAIN, we reconciled and went on a spontaneous camping trip and had a blast - something we usually plan way ahead because we're students and broke.

Just last night he sends me a text saying he can't do it anymore - a long paragraph of nearly the exact things he said the other two times: That he can't imagine spending his life with someone who is capable of cheating and has that side to them (!!!); that what he did for me the first 7 months weren't good enough for me; that the probability of cheating again is toxic. This took me by surprise because he has written me love-notes since giving our relationship a second chance, and has expressed his deep love for me in that breakup text as well as in nearly every opportunity he can. We were doing so many fun things lately that we both seemed so happy when we're around each other. 

This isn't perhaps the best timing because I found out today (same day I got the text) my mother got back abnormal cancer tests and it's really been driving me for a loop. I responded to his breakup text, but never addressed the breakup, I just said I needed to talk to him about my mother and that he was the only one I could confide in (no other family). He called me manipulative and thought I was using this cancer test as a reason to get back with him. He said at least *five times* that he's going no-contact with me, but retracted each time and said he was still is open to talking through messaging, just not in-person or phone call. He gave me some words of encouragement and that if my mothers condition worsens, he'll be there by my side.

As morbid as it sounds, the situation with my mom made me realize *just how short life can be* - I know where my priorities lie, and it's to continue a relationship with him! Perhaps I can word this better to mention to him (?).

Just yesterday night he's been asking me what I was up to, hows my mom doing, that he wishes I have a good and productive gym/training session. I'm totally confused. On one hand he wants to end things and go strictly no-contact, on the other he's still trying to talk to me like we were originally. Mind you, he was the one initiating these, albeit brief, conversations, even after he expressed wanting to keep minimize communication.

He wears his heart on his sleeve and he has a history of acting very irrationally, not being able to make up his mind, and regretting or changing his decisions after. Often what he says or does isn't necessarily representative of who *he* really is (ie. it may be his emotions talking and getting the better of him, not he who his talking). I'm not sure if his breaking up is irrational, if he can't make up his mind, or if this is something he truly wants. I think some time apart from each other would have sufficed. The last time he wanted to end things he did it in person, this time it was an abrupt text, which I find a little unsettling.

I have yet to say anything to his breakup text and I think I'll eventually be fine with whatever outcome, but I feel he's honestly the one for me. I've learned my lesson and I try my best to give him everything I could and we make each other so happy, but I don't know how to proceed at this point. I don't know how I can reassure him I've learned my lesson, that I have become incredibly more open, and that cheating won't be an issue later on. I've been as honest and upfront as I could, we still hung out like old times.

Thanks a lot, everyone!

Any help please?,0,False,3,0,1436959824,/r/relationships/comments/3ddcma/me_21m_and_my_exboyfriend_24m_of_9_months_are/,Romantic
148,2pof8v,"I apologize for the length of this post but I want to explain the situation as best I can. 

Background:
I[24M] live with my best friend since kindergarten[24M] who we will call Jack and his sister[22F] who we will call Sally. Me and Jack have been best friends for around 19 years and have been through everything and anything together. Highs, lows, breakups, when my father passed away and when his parents divorced. Without a doubt he is just as close if not closer to me than my actual brothers. I actually consider him a brother and part of my family. His sister Sally has always been like a sister to me and I've been like a brother to her. We always look out for each other and help with dating advice and sibling problems. We are also pretty close knit to say the least. 

Situation:
For the past year and a half I've been barely skimming by with jobs being few and far between. I'm a construction worker and work is slow. For the past year I've had to borrow almost $5k in total from my mother to keep paying bills on time and sometimes for rent. I just recently ended up having my vehicle repossessed for the second time, thus losing my union status/jobs to add to the mayhem. I basically broke down after that. I've been known to be a strong willed person but with how long and this situation has gone on for and with how bleak things look for me, I admittedly fell into depression. Nothing too dangerous but depression nonetheless. I thought I could keep my money, life and depression problems to myself pretty well as I am not one to ever show my feelings... Or so I thought. 

This past month(Nov) I fell through and couldn't pay my portion of rent on time(Dec 5th). Me and Jack have lived together for two years and this is the first time this has happened(late rent). I'm a problem solver and am usually able to figure things out but I couldn't fix this in time so I made the huge mistake of lying to Jack and offering to go pay our rent myself. Before I could scrape some money together to finish paying the rent the property management called and Jack ended up finding out it wasn't paid yet and was understandably pissed off. I knew I should have came forward with my rent problem sooner but I was too embarrassed. I have never lied to Jack before this. I came clean about not having my rent and gave Jack his and Sally's portions of rent back and said I'll try to take care of mine as soon as I can. He said if I can't figure it out he'd have to find a new roommate who can. I said I understand as it's the logical thing to do and went on with my day taking it as a get your ass in gear scolding from my best friend. 

That is when a switch flipped in Jack. The few times he talked to me since, he treated me like a deadbeat and talks down to me. He's been known to be an asshole but never to me. It got to the point where Sally noticed and had a heart to heart with me. I gave in and told her everything. She said she could tell for a while I was secretly depressed and something was wrong. She even told Jack over a month ago and that he should try to talk to me about it. He's had plenty of chances to bring it up since but not a word of it so far. She also talked to Jack's father and mother who were both really upset with him for being such a jerk to me throughout this and laying that alternate roommate ultimatum on me right off the bat. I was surprised because I felt I deserved some of it for lying and being unable to make rent. Sally then told me that her and her parent's would rather try to figure something out for me than force Jack and Sally to get another friend as roommate that they don't know/get along with as well. I told her how thankful I was for her caring so much but assured her that as much as it sucks, if I can't pay rent consistently, I would need to leave. I can't make them responsible or suffer from my financial problems, but I also explained how I didn't understand why Jack was being such a callous jerk to me and she agreed. We both were really confused on why he would act like this. 

I briefly talked to Jack this past weekend and explained how I should be getting a check from a company that owed me money and I would be able to pay the late rent Wednesday or Thursday. He seemed a little relieved about it but nothing more. This whole situation was a wake up call and made me reevaluate my life. I decided I need to get structure back in my life and to get away for a while. Throughout this week I've been going to an Air Force recruiter and am in the beginning stages of applying and going through the background check. I haven't had the chance to talk to Jack about it yet as we've both been busy but even after what happened I still wanted to talk to him and explain everything. After all, he's still my best friend and I'd want his input. That was until this next part. 

Jack texted me a few hours ago and asked if I had the money yet. I told him it wasn't transferred yet but I'll call tomorrow and see what's going on. He texted back saying to let him know asap because he already found someone to take over my room this weekend if I didn't have the money. I was shocked! Really? You just want me out now then? I simply texted back ok and that was that. I didn't want to overreact right now while I'm pissed off. 

Meanwhile I'm currently working for cash with a family member for the next few weeks and will have no problem making rent this month (Dec) so I was pretty upset to say the least after that text. 

I agree rent needs to be paid or I should move out but it feels like Jack now views me as an just another person rather than his best friend. Add in the callousness and cold shoulder attitude and it's a recipe for broken friendships. I almost always make sure not to let my emotions overrun my logic, but I can't shake this feeling that this has somehow ruined our best friend status. I was raised and taught that you shouldn't let anything come between you and your family. I considered Jack as a brother, as family. I used to think he felt the same way but after this, I'm not so sure. 

For now, I honestly don't even want to tell him about the Air Force. I'd rather keep my mouth shut, pay rent and have him find out through some other friend at the last minute before I'm off to basic. A sort of look what you let happen. I could definitely be overreacting and reading into it too much. It's already 4am here and depression doesn't like the terms sleep and rest. 

If you have gotten this far, you are amazing or just incredibly bored. Either way I would EXTREMELY appreciate any input and advice this community can offer. So what's a guy to do? 

TL:DR- Couldn't make rent, best friend of 19 years became a prick because of it, joining Air Force to fix my life but don't want to tell him about it, best friend relationship possibly ruined?

Edit: I need to clear a few things up as I did write this with little sleep. 

- the rent is as of today 13 days late, not a month, not two months

-the rent will be paid to current by tomorrow 

-this is the first time I couldn't find money to pay the rent to the property management

-the construction career wasn't a basic job. It was Union with a 5 year schooling program we signed a contract for stating that if we quit early and they didn't deem the reasoning for leaving as acceptable they could sue me in court for up to $13k/the cost of the schooling for the 3 years I was in. 

-as far as leaving to basic: our lease would be up the same month I would leave, or if sooner I would just find someone to take my place in the house. I'm not that fucked up. I wouldn't just dip out and leave them with a year contract with no way to afford it. 

-I didn't initially see it as me endangering his and his sister's living arrangements. It's a good point. I just saw it as one late payment

And the next time we saw each other for another night out, I hugged her when I was saying hi to all of the cousins and told her that I got her a gift before I officially went back home (I got the other cousins gifts too) and she asked me when I was coming back from a different city in their country.  That way, we could talk and just get more quality time just the two of us.  Things didn't work out that way because we ran out of time and she was busy with work during that time of the year.  We tried talking through text (messaging/email), but it didn't feel the same way--it felt uncomfortable for me and sometimes her replies seemed 'distant' since she's going through a lot in her life (her sister is a drug addict and has schizophrenia and her boyfriend of eight years and her broke up while working on a condo together in the new year).  I finally asked her if we could talk on the phone so she could fill me in about things and she was more than okay with that.  

I knew I wanted to tell her the part about my mental health history (PTSD-dissociation/depersonalization/derealization) and working with a trauma specialist because of her sister and I didn't want to hide that one part of my life when I knew they were going through things.  But, I feel like the whole situation went exactly the opposite of how I wanted and the few emails sounded like therapy sessions according to my mom and I just wonder, if this thing were to ever happen again, how could I learn from this situation?  I don't want my older cousin to think I'm someone that lies all the time or someone that she can't trust because I lied to her that night.  I just didn't want to ruin our special time together.

Fast forward further. Here I am in her home state. We've met, she's awesome, she's still into me. I'm even more into her than I was before. We want to try and make a long-distance thing work as a long-term thing. As in maybe one day it won't be long-term. I can deal with this if the conditions are right.

I have one more night to see her before I go home...

Come to find, she still has some feelings for her most recent ex and he still loves her. Enter catch #2.

She tells me she cares for me and wants to open up to me but has yet to. I'm not kidding myself when I say I think she really wants to be with me but her feelings are being fucked up by her ex. He was her longest relationship and they're still close. He's a nice guy but doesn't come across as a real threat to me in the areas that matter to her. But still these feelings persist. 

I'm a smart guy and I know she's as wonderful as I think she is. I just don't understand what more I can do. I don't know where I stand. I asked her the question formally (..will you go out with me?) and I've yet to have a solid answer. I wouldn't go as far as to say she's leading me on...because she's too nice to do that...but she's being indecisive and hiding her feeing becase of it. It's making things very difficult for me emotionally. 

Reddit, I love this girl with all my heart. She makes me smile. She makes me laugh. She's unbelievably perfect in my eyes. I know I'm not dreaming but I feel like I am when I'm with her because she makes my day that much better. I want to lasso the moon, pull it down, and give her it. Rearrange the starts so they're a little closer to her. And for the first time, I feel like I've found someone who'd do the same for me.

If things don't work out, I'll be okay...but I really want them to. I haven't ever met a girl like this and it'll be a seriously long time before I do again. 

I need a shot of confidence more than anything right now but don't bullshit me either. I want advice and I'll take it positive or negative regardless.

Thanks.

But he does it in a way that if you were to ask him to stop he would be like, I hope you didn't think I was serious. 

During freshman year he started dating my friend Willow. And that's fine, I didn't like him. But he would flirt with me through the whole relationship. And I didn't know how to get him to stop. I was stupid and fed into it. He would talk about the type of circumstances that would be required for us to have sex. We went on a field trip and he kept flirting with me and held my hand. I didn't know how to say no, but I've never liked him like that. He does this with a lot of girls. 

After he broke up with Willow he started dating a girl names Jill. He was madly in love with Jill and I didn't hear from him for about a year. She broke up with him and now he's back at it. I wanted to try to stay friends with him because I'm very shy and quiet and don't have many friends, especially now that I'm out of school. But he won't stop flirting. I hung out with him twice. The first time he kept trying to sit on my lap and hug me. The second time it was cold out and he tried to warm me up.

But every time he does weird stuff like that he says something like, i bet you're uncomfortable. and I don't say anything. I just ignore him.

Also, he recently sent me an unwanted picture of his cock in a sock. He joked about it but then he actually pm'd me a picture of it on IG. wtf. And he said don't look if you don't want to see. but I looked to just see if he actually did it. Apparently it notifies the person when you see it. 

He hits on tons of girls. Messaging them stuff like wow, I love summer. nice swim suit when they post swim suit pictures. he's ALWAYS talking about random girls he found attractive and girls in his class that he likes. 

Also, he won't stop asking when I can hang out. I DO NOT WANT TO EVER AGAIN. HE MAKES ME SO UNCOMFORTABLE. I don't want to hurt his feelings though. I'm trying to hint at it. Every time he messages me saying what are you doing? or are you free today? I just message back busy and ignore him. But then he messages OVER AND OVER with, what are you doing when are you free pls hang out luv meh plz be there and all that stuff and then I feel bad and message him. 

I made a mistake of sending him some risque photos from a  photography shoot I did. He does photography too and I was trying to get his opinion on some pictures because he's the only photography guy I know. Now he has four pictures of me in a bra. They are artistic though, not like sexy nude pictures. Just portraits in a bra and sheer top. I'm an idiot. 

He's very needy and clingy and flirty and I DO NOT like him AT ALL. He's weird and over sexual and it makes me uncomfortable, but we've been friends for a while and I know he has some mental health problems and self image issues and stuff. I feel bad just ignoring him, but ugh.

Oh, also I forgot to mention that I HAVE A BOYFRIEND AND HE KNOWS THAT. It's a LDR and we have never met irl, but I like my boyfriend and I don't like feeling like I'm cheating because this boy won't stop flirting with me. We keep out relationship a secret for the most part because both of us  hate people getting involved in our relationships, but Jay is the only person I've told about him, yet he refuses to see it as a real thing. He just completely ignores the fact that I'm not single.

Reddit, my story is such a long one so maybe I'll just give you the main points.

I've been with my husband for 5yrs, married for 2yrs &amp; we have a beautiful 1yo daughter. My husband works hard and thus I am able to be a SAHM, for which I am so very grateful. That being said, our relationship sucks! We are not affectionate with each other AT ALL, we haven't had sex in 3 WEEKS! He doesn't do ANYTHING except sleep, eat, poop, &amp; breathe unless I tell him to. &amp; yes that includes brushing his own damn teeth! And then when I do ask him to do something, like take out the trash, I get his response, Stop telling me to do stuff, you're not my mom. Keep in mind because of the fact that I am a SAHM I am very serious about my role. I am our daughters primary care giver so to speak, I take care of ALL of the cooking, cleaning, bills, groceries, you name it I do it. I ask 4 simple things from him; take out the trash when it's full, clean the shower once a week(something I just simply hate to do), just overall not be a COMPLETE slob, and be a damn good Dad. He doesn't do anything for our daughter whom he only sees for 1.5hrs a day. I have to ASK him to give her a bath or put her to bed. That's right, I have to ASK him to take care of his own daughter. His response then, Well, why don't you do it?! I just don't know what to do. I've told him how I'm feeling, I've given him ultimatums time and time again. He just doesn't listen?? or take me seriously?? I don't even know what the problem is! Worst part, I love the guy but I don't think I'm IN love with the guy. Help?

160,2076c6,"Me and my girlfriend have been together for a little over a year and have been living together the whole time. I can tell she really cares about me in everything she does, and is always thinking of me. She can make me feel happier than I've ever felt before, but also more miserable than I've ever been.


She gets upset very easily, and we end up fighting all the time. She's very verbally and emotionally abusive towards me when she's upset. I think a lot of this has to do with ME being very new to relationships and especially relating to people's emotions. We've talked about this and she's brought up how it's ridiculous we've been together for a year, and yet I still don't understand her or know how to make her feel better in a fight.


When she's upset, she can just give me the cold shoulder for hours and hours on end while I'm trying to talk with her. She'll just turn on the TV, or music, and turn the volume all the way up, or just start playing some game on her phone. I'll try for hours to tell her that I'm sorry. Any attempt I make to turn off the TV/music/phone is met with her blowing up at me even more. 


I try to apologize repeatedly, and tell her that I understand why she's upset, and to promise that it won't happen again, or I'll change about myself whatever it is that's bothering her. But I feel like I'm talking to a stone wall. If I stay, she wants me to leave her the fuck alone. If I try to cuddle up with her, or even touch her in any way, she'll start to punch/kick me. If I walk away because I'm angry or I feel like she's out of control, and try to give her space, she'll get even more upset. She feels that I'm ignoring and am being selfish because I'm putting my feelings over hers, and don't care about her enough to fix the situation. 


I don't understand what to do to fix our fights and make her feel better, when it seems like every thing I do is wrong. 


I'm sick of this biweekly emotional roller coaster of thinking we're over, asking my friends if I can crash for the night, and looking for a new place to live, only to have us patch everything together again, and my friends looking at me like I'm crazy. She makes me feel like less of a man, and is constantly telling me of what a terrible boyfriend I am and how all these other guys treated her better, and how I don't deserve her. And on some level, I feel like I'm starting to believe her.

She said she would get a cab back to the apartment we share around midnight but when I woke up this morning she wasn't here. She finally texted me later this morning and said she got too drunk, her phone died, and went to her female classmate's apartment. 


She hasn't been acting strange lately and is insistent she would never cheat, which I'm inclined to believe as this has never been an issue.  I'm just so hurt and mad, frankly, that I don't know how to get past it or if this is worth ending the relationship over. We've been exchanging texts (I'm at work, typing from my phone, atm) but I'm still really pissed. 


The kicker is I *just* bought an engagement ring last week. I obviously am not considering proposing in the immediate future but I don't know if it would be best to return the ring and get my money back or hold onto it in case we work it out.

540,31f02j,"tl;dr my friend gets immensely angry at me for not treating him as he expects, he proceeds to become manically depressed and recently told a guidance counsellor he wants to end his life. What do I do?




My friend is a bit of a Debbie downer, but on the outside he seems like a sensible enough fellow. We got to know each other in college, we went to the same high school but I never noticed him because we were never in the same class and his high school years were uneventful. I was abit of an asshole in college, and didn't quite amass the social circle I had back in high school, so naturally we became very good friends.





The problem starts to unfurl when at the start of the year he seems to intentionally avoid and ignore me. When I approach him to explain himself he exasperatedly claims that I'm making him fucking mad and that I bring him down. I apologise, not knowing what I've done to cause such a backlash. He claims I abandoned him, saying that me not sitting next to him means I ignore him in class. I interject, saying that in actual fact I've just been sitting where I've always sat since the start of the semester. He then says I should've moved to sit with him. When I bring up the fact that I hang out with him after class, he says that's not enough. I caved in at the time, promising to sit with him in class. 




Things just start going downhill from there, as he makes more and more increasingly ludicrous demands. I invite him to a hvz match(its a popular nerf game type), hoping things will become copacetic. Midway through the game he becomes distant, ignoring my calls to stick with the team. He's the first one to tagged by the zombies (unsusprisingly), and after the match he complains, saying that I deliberately ignored two questions. At this point you can understand my frustration. I try my best to explain, but he isn't having any of it. By that point I just gave up. I told him to leave me alone, because everything I've done seems to aggravate him. 



He sits even further in class (way out front), he starts banging doors, and he also ignores his other friends because he thinks they were part of an elaborate betrayal that is way too pathetic for me to even bother elaborating,( basically he misheard some piece of dialogue and claims they lied and manipulated the truth). We ( me and the guys) agree that we're tired of his shit, to which he starts calling us out for gossiping about him. 




 We try our best to ignore his petulant behaviour, and a few weeks pass, by which point he starts rage texting me, claiming that I'm a horrible backstabber or something to that extent. I reciprocate the hate, and we start ranting off at each other full caps. I claim he's delusional, he claims I'm full of shit, and our back and forth seems to go on to no end. He says I've changed and expresses his desire for things to be back the way it was. Feeling angry, I tell him that this bridge was one he chose to burn, so he should be the one to fix things. At this point I'm in a position of power, he yields and promises to start making changes. 





He starts to approach me, and we try to hang out. Obviously I feel uneasy, and I give noncommittal replies to his questions. He does his nervous jig, and leaves just as quickly as he came. It was weird, you get the picture. 



At this point I can't even be bothered to handle his insecurities, because I'm trying to handle girl issues (refer to previous Reddit post). I get my shit together, and at least me and the woman are on talking terms now, but things on the guy front still don't look too good. He starts harassing me with desperate texts to the point that I block him on facebook. He then proceeds to text my cell, doing his best I'm the victim in this story lines. 





I have since then unblocked him, and added him back as a friend (interestingly enough he unfriended me first), on the condition that he stop being needy and treating me like his emotional dust bin. 




Now he's spiralling out of control. He texts me occasionally with sharp outbursts, one recent one being about me missing two classes and not telling him about it, snippet of conversation:( whats the problem this time? You are avoiding me now. You skipped class two times without telling me why. You are burning the bridges not me. I did everything you want, suddenly you just exploded. You are the worst. Be a man and say what you want stop hiding and lying.) Obviously this is insanity, and when I explain the situation (trying not to blow up), he apologises, and tells me about his intention to commit suicide. He says cutting isn't enough, and the salt doesnt help the pain. He has also told one of the guidance counsellors, so I'm pretty scared that this might be legit. He has started taking paracetemol to deal with the pain, 
And he's scaring the shit out of me. 




He comes from a broken household and his mum is a drunk with suicidal tendencies. He lives with his dad who gambled the house away, so stays with his grandmother. I don't know how to help him, and at this point he's starting to freak me out. He says I'm his first true friend, and has blamed me for everything from betrayal and ultimately for his depression. I don't know what to do, I want to just make my exit, but I'm scared he'll actually off himself. I know this makes me selfish, but I have no idea how to help him anymore, everything I do just seems to drive him deeper and deeper into this insanity.

30,214tfe,"About 4 months ago in December my ex broke up with me before I was sent overseas where I now live. We were high school sweethearts and then I joined the military, she was in college. Then it became a long distance relationship. We were together almost two years.

Today someone began texting both of us from a phone number in her area code. They began asking if my (then) gf and I know each other, mentioned things about us that we haven't told each other, etc. This person was obviously trying to cause some drama.

A few months ago, someone created a few Twitter accounts and sent me nasty messages about my (then) girlfriend. She thought it was me doing it! I would never ever do something like that, especially to her. Even to this day she still blamed me for it even though I gave her proof it was not me.

Move forward to today -- she now says it is over because apparently her ex made it look like I was the one doing the texting. My (now ex) girlfriend had her sister call me and told me to stop talking to her. Her sister told me her ex called the number that was texting us and that I used my phone to call that number back. Completely false. He is totally setting me up. He has even told her (as of two months ago) that he wanted to start over with her. 

Now my (now ex) girlfriend does not even want to talk to me. She asked me, via her sister, to never contact her again. I will respect this, however I did not do it! The phone number that was texting both of us is a cell phone registered to Verizon that has an area code 1000s of miles away (in her area code, and also the area code of her ex). I even filed a police report because of the harassment. I do not know what more proof I can give her??! I have never cheated, lied or given her reason not to trust me. Her long term ex was a sneaky guy who completely treated her like crap. I actually made her happy and she loved being with me... until the Twitter thing when things got rocky and I started to overreact to everything during a time of space.

Story of what I know happened: He was 'in a relationship' with a Thai woman off some shady-ass website (one of those websites that you'll find on the side of a porn or torrent site) on the internet, they  have contacted each other on a few occasions.

He also told his co-workers that he was going on a 3 week holiday and took the time off. He only took his important stuff. His laptop, tablet, camera, (he didn't own much) and his work clothes.

She was a year older than me and she just had that 'it' factor. She was incredibly outgoing and absolutely gorgeous. I've made many friends throughout college, but never anyone who has that same magnetic pull that she has. I wish I could explain it better, but words just don't do it justice. 

One day she singled me out and started talking to me. I had just recently been dumped by my boyfriend and I was starting to feel not so close to my other friends- whom I had been friends with since elementary school. We started growing apart. Turns out Alex, who seemed to have it all, could totally relate. It was like a breath of fresh air. We started hanging out outside of school, and I felt closer to her than I did to anyone I'd ever met, and to this day I still feel the same way. I felt even closer to her than I did to any boyfriends I've had despite the lack of intimacy. I was naive and she wasn't. She opened up my whole world.

We talked about anything and everything and she opened my mind up to places it had never been. We would spend hours sitting in her backyard, looking at the stars, and talking about everything. She showed a deeply genuine interest in me as a person. That's something that is incredibly hard for me to find. In Pulp Fiction there is a quote, There are two types of people. Those who listen and those who wait to talk. She was a listener, as am I. Usually my friendships felt very one-sided as a result, but not with her. It felt like I met my platonic soul mate, as strange as that sounds. She would often express the same feelings towards me.

We started hanging out every single day and were inseparable. To this day I have never felt so close to anyone as I did to her. And I've had two long-term boyfriends since then. Since I was a year younger than her she went off to college, and suddenly the person I spent ALL my time with was gone. I felt alone and sad, although I did visit her a few times. We had never gotten into a fight before until now, and I regret my actions even though they may have been blown out of proportion.

One day I was hanging out with my friend Mike. We were really bored and trying to find someone else to hang out with or someones house to go to. He gets a call from Alex's ex-boyfriend of 3 years who cheated on her and was overall really terrible to her. I tell him that I don't think it would be a good idea to hang out with him because of Alex, but Mike insists that it would be no big deal. So I reluctantly agreed. Everything seems fine and normal until I get an angry call from Alex. Turns out her ex posted a status on Facebook saying he was hanging out with me, obviously for the sole purpose of upsetting Alex. Alex is upset with me, understandably so, but we make up. However, there is a new tension between us that never existed before and we start talking less and less.

About 2 months later is New Years Eve. I'm at a party of my co-worker's with a bunch of people who weren't from my town. Somehow (I still have no idea how) Alex's boyfriend shows up and I instantly get a sick feeling in my stomach. I knew he was going to stir up some drama. I avoided him for as long as possible until he comes up to me, drunk, talking tons of crap about Alex. I inform him that the last time I saw him he caused a big fight between Alex and I and that it was best he left me alone. But he didn't. He kept going on and on about her. I told him he needs to back off and that she was seeing someone else now(which was true) and that he needed to get over her and stop talking shit. 

The next day I get a long angry Facebook message from Alex. She told me that I was totally out of place telling him about her new boyfriend and that he is basically harassing her now because of me. She told me to 'keep my name out of your mouth and to stop talking to my psycho ex'. I tried explaining that it was a stupid mistake and he wouldn't leave ME alone, but she wouldn't have any of it. I became angry in return, for her not giving me the benefit of the doubt and we stopped talking for months. I randomly messaged her once to see if she wanted to get together. She said sure, but never followed through. I haven't spoken to her in 2 years now but I miss that friendship so much. I miss her like I would miss a sister, and I would love to revive this friendship. Like I said, I've never felt so connected to anyone before, and I don't want to just let that go. What advice do you have for me?

1020,3cgwg7,"ok, here goes nothing..

I've posted here before, about a month or so ago asking how I should go about talking to a girl. I wouldn't call myself shy around people at all, but when it comes to her I can't handle myself and end up not saying anything to her at all.


**Backstory**: So there's this girl that I've seen around my school who is two grades below me and is pretty damned shy. Since I live in a pretty small town, everyone know everyone, so we both know each other. She also happens to be my friend's sister (who is ok with us talking). Anyway, I started talking to her on Facebook. She seemed pretty excited that I was talking to her, and we'd sort of take turn starting up the conversation everyday: her asking if I had a good day, good night, etc.

This goes on for a week or so, and she asks if I'd like her phone number, so I was pretty stoked I got this far. (This being my first time talking with another girl like this and her not having a bf before)

We'd talk like we knew each other our entire lives while we were texting, but when we'd see each other in school, we wouldn't talk to each other. We'd lock eyes, smile at each other, but never once did I have a conversation with her other than a simple: hey.

One time I worked up the courage to actually call her. When she picked up and said Hello, I said: Hey, how are you doing? She dropped the call.. Immediately after, she texted saying she was busy, but wanted to know what I wanted to talk about. In reality, I was going to ask her for out for a fun first date.

Fast forward a month, and school is let out for the summer. I just so happened to crash my car on the last day of school, and couldn't really take her, or ask her out for that matter. We still texted quite a bit, but not as much as usual. When it came to grad parties and the such over the next few weekends, something inside of me couldn't talk to her even if she was 3 ft away from me. She looked like she wanted to talk, but we were both shy of each other for some reason.

Slowly, we sort of stopped talking. 

Then one day, she sent me this: 

&gt; -No. Ok I'm sorry to say this...but I just want to be friends. You may think of it as more but I don't.

&gt; -Ok. Hope you find someone as amazing as you are 

&gt; -Thanks.

&gt; -You don't have to answer this, but did you just want to be friends from the beginning?

&gt; -Well I honestly didn't know..

&gt; -Neither did I.

&gt; -Sorry..

My heart was broken. I didn't know what went wrong at first. Thinking she didn't like how I looked anymore or something. 

She was gone..

- - - - -

I don't think I've ever gone a day without thinking about her. I haven't talked or been in contact with her since the day she told me that. I'm interning at an office job, and most of the day is spent thinking about her. I can't concentrate on anything I'm doing: I stopped making my YouTube videos, stopped running, stopped being my 'normal self', I guess.

I haven't talked to anyone else about all of this, thinking it'd be too complicated to understand. But I now realize that she probably felt as if I just wanted to text her, and act like I didn't know her anywhere else; embarrassed of her. (Which is not the case at all.) 

From the time of writing this, it's been about a month and a half since we stopped talking. I know it isn't very significant, but she is usually the first to watch all of my Snapchat Stories, and likes any Instagram photos I put up. Something to hold onto I guess.

I think it's worth noting: something deep down (my gut, karma, God, whatever it is) is telling me that she's the one. Now that may just be whatever, but it's something I've never felt before.

**My question now, I guess**: is whether or not I should text her, call her, leave her a voicemail, something? Her being pretty damned shy, might not start up anything even if she wanted to. 

But I wake up every morning checking my phone to see if she wants to talk anymore..
   
**tl;dr**: We text, but never talked. We both like each other. She has a very shy personality, while I'm the opposite. But when it comes to her I can't seem to talk. Should I text her back after a month of no talking?

1037,2lsrmw,"This is a complicated problem that involves an unconventional relationship and a pregnancy. Throwaway account for obvious reasons. Not sure how to handle this problem from an ethical and especially a legal point of view. I feel trapped.

My GF is pregnant. I am not the father. I am 100% sure of this as I've never had unprotected sex with her or come inside her. She does not dispute that I'm not the father, we both agree on that. Still, she claims that I have a responsibility to help her raise the baby (which she plans on carrying to term). I'm afraid she has a case, certainly an ethical case. Not sure if she has a legal case for this, though she claims she does and I'm afraid she might.

Here's why. What follows may be disturbing for some, but I'm asking you not to judge. We have an open relationship. In fact it's just open on her side so it's a cuckold relationship I guess (please don't ask me to post to that subreddit, that's a fetish subreddit and they wouldn't know how to give me the kind of advice I'm asking for which doesn't have to do with a fetish per se). I've encouraged and occasionally watched her with her fuckbuddy. We were totally open about this and I was totally supportive of it, and she knew I enjoyed her doing this. At a point about three months ago they both got tested and decided to start having sex without protection. I supported this decision as well.

No I'm not a neckbeard or fat or ugly, I'm a financially stable and fit, good-looking guy, and she's a young good looking girl. We just happen to have this fetish, which I agree is admittedly weird to most but it is what it is and now I'm in this pickle.

Now here's where the problem comes in. During our sex sessions she started to talk about getting pregnant by this guy. I found the idea very hot and whole-heartedly encouraged it. This didn't happen just once but repeatedly, so I'm not denying this. She let me watch them together a few times and during these times I also encouraged him to come inside her and we both found the idea of her getting knocked up very exciting. She asked me, again during various sex sessions, if I'd raise the baby as my own and I agreed, again on more than one occasion. I found the idea very arousing as did she. But I guess I always thought this was sexual play or part of a sexual fantasy. She's now saying that she thought I meant it in real life and that I have a responsibility to be the father or help her raise the baby.

If this was a misunderstanding, or if she's just pretending it was, I still don't know what to do. I guess if she misunderstood she does have a case, and I'd feel guilty for leading her on even unintentionally. I really just thought it was part of our fantasy, but maybe she meant it for real. Even so, I'm not ready to be a father now, especially to another man's baby. But she's sensing I'm resisting this so she's actually saying that I have a legal responsibility. She's saying I repeatedly declared that I would be the legal father and help her with all raising of the baby. I don't know if she has a legal case but she's starting to say she does.

If I tell her it's a no-go I'm not sure what she will do. If she lists me as the legal father and I try to fight it in court, will I lose the case? How could I convince a judge that I just thought this talk was part of our sexual fetish or fantasy?

I do feel guilty if indeed I led her on unintentionally. Maybe I actually WOULD help her raise the baby or do something like that, but I'm not sure yet, and I certainly don't want to be legally bullied into this or feel this kind of threat. Some advice (legal, but also ethical) would be welcome.

We got married last fall, and kinda rushed it to get her insurance to correct medical issues to allow her to have kids.  I love her and figured moving the wedding up was ok.  I love to play video games, nothing crazy however.  I play xbox/ps4 when she is not at home, and once she gets home I stop within minutes.  There are rare times( every other month) where I play while she naps.  I play xbox to stay close to my younger brothers.  I only keep 2 games at a time, so I don't play it all the time.  Fast forward to this month.  

We got in an argument at the beginning of last week.  She gets up, and walks out the door.  I figured she needed to cool off and let her go.  After awhile there is a fraud department call from our bank, with weird charges to a divorce attorney website.  I didn't know what to say, I tried to call her but to no avail.  She came home, stating she was going to find a place to move out to and we should get a legal separation.  I slept on the couch a couple nights, and one night she comes home from the bars at 2am.  She is trying to kiss on me, saying she is sorry.  Next day we talk briefly and everything goes back to normal.  I was still upset she went to such an extreme so fast, but we talked and let it go.  Fast forward to the end of the weekend. 

I go out with my friends that came into town from a state away.  I wanted to spend time with them and my wife didn't want to hang out.  She said it was ok for me to go.  The next morning she is upset that I was too hung over to go to lunch with her family.  I was on the couch, under a blanket, eating pretzels while watching family feud.  She grabbed my controllers for gaming system, and took them with her so I didn't play while she was gone.  I let it go, decided to take a shower after an hr or so.  My mom calls me, my wife text my mom telling me that my parents needed to have a talk with me because I was being a terrible husband.  I decided to head over to my parents to talk to them.  I talk with them about everything, and they are very supportive of me and the relationship.  They want it to work out, but they think therapy is the best option.  I totally agree, but my wife continued to text my mom after I was there.  She stated that this is what I always do, I run to my parents to talk to them.  Being very confused, my mom asked isn't that what you wanted him to do?  No real response except that I was being an immature terrible husband.

I stayed at my parents that night and the following night.  I was confused, upset, and didn't want to say anything I would regret.  She text me a few times, but got mean and told me to go file for divorce.  To which I said I would not.  I went back to our apartment, we talked and was fine.  Two days later, I planned on visiting my brothers and playing xbox until my wife got off work at 7.  She stated I NEEDED to be home at 7.  I was kinda off put by it, but said ok.  She decides she was going to get off work early and I needed to head home at 3.  I wasn't ready to go back home yet and wanted to be home on the agreed 7.  This upset her, she said I was immature, I never paid attention to her, and that she was last on my priority list.  She tells me to go file for divorce, stay at my parents, and come get some clothes in the next day or two.  

I talked with my parents, who at this point just want me to be happy and want to see this relationship work.  However they said whatever would make me happy, they would support.  I go get some clothes after a couple days and she isn't home.  Later that night she begins texting my mom again, however this time trying to get an argument.  God bless my mom she doesn't bite, but says she just wants her and me to be happy and work on things.  She texts me, continues with the divorce thing, and later that night text me drunk wanting me to come get her from a bar.
Yesterday, she text me wanting me to come home, we needed to talk and that it could work out.  I said the only way this would work out would be therapy, as I don't feel like I'm being unreasonable in anything.  She says for me to come home, but get rid of my gaming systems and phone.  I decide after that I would not be coming home but I would be scheduling therapy asap.  I schedule it for later this week, but have to complete online questionnaires separately.  She says she isn't doing anything online and I needed to find a closer therapist to our place because 35 minute drive is too far.

622,2mpbm6,"Some background: I left home pretty early (15yo) to pursue study abroad and follow a passion. My parents supported me through it all financially and emotionally. We do not come from money so supporting me was difficult. In the end, their efforts paid off and I was able to fulfill my aspirations and be a financially stable adult. I have been going home for the holidays every year and also during the summers at least for a week. This has meant that I have not traveled much since I use all my vacation to go see them. I am also not married so in their eyes, I belong at home for the holidays. My dad passed away 4 years ago and since that time my mother has had a very hard time adjusting. My siblings live close and see her daily but I am away. I often feel like I am the only reason she is happy some times. I feel responsible in some ways for her happiness and often put her feelings ahead of mine. In the past two years I have gone in vacations outside of the country and took her with me so that I could spend time with her and also see a different place. This year has been very, very busy for me - I've been working very long days and I haven't had any time for myself (I went on a two week vacation but it wasn't as relaxing as I had my mom with me at most times, still a good time! But it required more planning, etc) At any rate, this year I really just want to take the time to relax and not have to travel (there are no direct flights, and there is a 3 hour drive at the other end as well). I told my mom and she became sad, my sister just emailed me asking how much a ticket would be. My mom is in her mid 70s and even though her health is well, I worry that I may regret not going if her health deteriorates or something happens, like I should have been there. 
I want to add that I don't think this would have been an issue if my dad were alive. He was all about us being happy and doing what we wanted to do and just supporting us however he could. My parents were together for 40+ years so his passing has had a huge impact on my mom (everyone, of course but she feels it more than us). She has been depressed since his pasing but has been seeing a psychiatrist for the last 10 months and she says she feels well.

486,30lqx4," My boyfriend and I have been together for 3 years and have been living together for almost 2 years.  We've talked about marriage and buying a house together, but I've got issues I am trying to work through (depression).  I do love him and trust him, but when he is with his friends, he can't ever tell them no and he has lied to me in the past over stupid, small things with his friends involved.

So for the problem at hand.  SO's friend is getting married this summer and they are planning the bachelor party.  I am 100% against strip clubs and SO knows this, I've made it perfectly clear.  He went to a different bachelor party 2 years ago and he knew I wasn't okay with it, but told me to deal with it and it's what guys do for bachelor parties.  He swears he didn't get a lap dance, just the groom did.  

So for the bachelor party coming up, they are planning on renting a house, going to a concert and some paintball.  I overheard him on the phone with his friend talking about all the things they are going to be doing and they mentioned yea we'll stay at the house one night and drink and get drugs and have some girls come.  After he got off the phone, I told him I am not comfortable AT ALL that they have strippers come to the house.  I'd hate if they go to a strip club,  but at least they can't touch while there, but if they have strippers come to the house, with a lot of alcohol and drugs around, I feel like things can get out of hand quickly.  He says its not going to happen and that I don't need to worry.

Last night, I did what I shouldn't have and I checked his email while he was out.  I just knew he was lying.  I looked through the thread with the guys and the last one sent was an itinerary for the weekend.  The guy said we'll hang at the house the last night and drink and grill some food and then obviously we need some adult entertainment and listed how much it would cost for 4 girls to come to the house and he also said how they obviously need to get some blow too.

When I read this, I felt sick to my stomach.  I know I need to talk to him and tell him I read his email and he'll be pissed about it, but I don't know how to deal with this.  I know people are divided on the whole strip club/stripper thing, but I am really against it and the thought of them having naked girls walking around and partying with them honestly just makes me sick.  I know he's going to go to the party no matter what (it's for one of his oldest friends and he's in the bridal party) and I know he won't tell these people no strippers ( he has mentioned before how strippers turn him on and he has a hard time telling friends no)  Last night, I was thinking this might even be a deal breaker for me.  Am I completely unreasonable for thinking like that?  I just feel sick about the whole thing and I honestly don't know what to do.


**tl;dr**: Boyfriend lied about strippers being at the house for an upcoming bachelor party, it makes me sick to my stomach.  He's going to go to the party no matter what I say.  

EDIT-  Thanks everyone for your thoughts.  I have a lot to think about.  As for the cocaine issue, my boyfriend isn't a coke head and hasn't done it since college.

I don´t think she is having an affair, but I do believe she has a sexual compulsion (addiction?) She told me about a ¨friendin high-school that always held them up because she was giving a hand job or bj to random guys she found. I think it was her way of telling me the truth. 

I feel that she has not been HONEST with me, and that makes me angry and sad. I believe that I have shown her that I love her. Just wish she would be open about what she is dealing with. We have a really good family but her behavior is taking a toll on me.

1238,22p68m,"We are both previously divorced with kids from other relationships. On our first date I said I'm friends with my ex-husband and he said Great, I'm friends with my ex wife Relationship proceeded beautifully.

It turned out, down the road, that we had different ideas of what Friends with an ex meant. For him it meant he didn't hate her and the could speak to each other pleasantly. For me it meant real friends. We still did stuff together with the kids. He picked me up from the airport. BF at the time had a problem with that and I understood. I told ex that it was time for me to put my relationship first. We could still parent our kids together but the friendship had to stop. 

Flash forward a year or so. BF and I are now married, just bought a house, and still having issues re my ex. We are not friends anymore, I only talk to him about issues relating to our children. Husband doesn't believe me. Ex called a few weeks ago in tears because he broke up with his girlfriend (I was his best friend for a long time, i think calling me was like auto pilot) I didn't engage in the conversation, asked if he needed anything from me in relation to the children and he got the picture, hung up the phone. He apologized later on for calling. Husband was pissed off that he called me. I think he sees this as proof that we are still friends. 

Things came to a huge head last night because in the mail there was a bank statement for a joint account my ex and I had YEARS ago, that I thought was long closed. Apparently there was still money in it so they slowly took it out as maintenance fees. 

I am lost here and don't know what to do. I have told him that I feel like I have done everything I can possibly do in this situation and nothing works. I think his jealousy and insecurity are so overwhelming that he can't see reason here. We went to couples counseling for a while but it didn't seem to help. He has expressed that he thinks he needs individual counseling but nothing has come of it.

623,266eam,"We are both 32 and have been together for about 2 1/2 years.  We are  both lawyers.  She is more ambitious than I am and, when we met, more accomplished.  She went to a top 10 law school, got a killer score on one of the hardest bar exams in the country, and had a job at a heavy-hitter firm gunning for the partner track.  At that time, I was just middling in my career at an OK firm, I liked it fine.  The partners at that firm liked me and one did in particular.  When he went to a better firm he managed to help me get me a job there, too.  We work together there and I feel he is a great mentor and that I could be on the partner track very soon.  

My girlfriend is now not doing well at her job, the partners don't like her and they recently told her that, at the end of the year, they are going to let her go.  She was crushed.  It's a real old boys network there (only one partner is a woman out of eight) and though they threw out the red carpet to recruit her from another job, they started making things pretty tough for her since then.  They have promoted others ahead of her (always men), she has had to withstand criticisms in front of her colleagues, and some of the old guys even go as far as to make fun of her outfits in front of others.  

Although losing this job seems like good riddance to bad rubbish, she is crushed.  She felt like she lost a lot of time in her career working hard just to stay in one place there because being a partner is big deal -- an amazing accomplishment and puts her in the path of exactly what she wants to do.  Getting fired from this place doesn't exactly make it easy for her to make anything but a lateral move, if that.  She is in a bad place, wondering why she worked so hard to get into her top school, kick ass there, only to have it fall apart years later.  I get it.  She feels that, if we move she is more likely to get a better job, and she is right.  And if she leaves now, while she still has this job, the taint might not follow her too far.  

The issue is that my job is a great one for me, and I don't think I could ever find one even remotely as good. My career is going gangbusters.  I love my work, I really like my boss and I have great colleagues.  I feel I have job and financial security within my reach for the first time and it feels amazing. 

The other issue is that, when it comes to money, I really feel I need this job.  I don't have any debt, but I also don't have much of a savings. My mother is a widow and I have a sick brother who I like to help out when I can.  She has some family money.  Not enough that she'd never have to work, but she doesn't have to be a big-bucks lawyer.  She could have plenty of other jobs. She has that gold star degree and she is really smart.  She is also great at getting new jobs and I most certainly am not.

My girlfriend and I had been together for a little under a year and a half and things were going really well. Really really well. I've never felt like I did about her about anybody else.  I've met her family, she's met mine, we've spent holidays together, say I love you often, and have even talked about marriage in the future.  
  
We are both graduate students, I'm getting my PhD and she is getting a double masters. I have 3 or 4 more years and she has 2. We know that in the future we will inevitably have a long distance situation on our hands and we had talked about it and I had told her that with how I felt, there wouldn't be any reason I could see in not trying. In the back of my head I was even thinking that we might be engaged at that point anyway.
  
This summer she went away for an internship in DC and we new the distance was going to be hard but she was only going to be gone for 10 weeks so we knew there was no reason to let it effect anything. I went out to visit her a few weeks ago and we had an absolutely amazing weekend and after I got back it was only 4 weeks until she returns.  
  
We have an issue with communication that we are both aware of and have talked about a lot. I've overly sensitive. She says things off-handedly that upset me and she doesn't mean to but it's lead to her feeling like she is always upsetting me and that she has to watch everything that she says. I know this and so I was also trying to be stronger and not let as much get to me. This issue was exacerbated this summer because of the distance and if we had an issue it sometimes wouldn't be resolved for many hours because of our different busy schedules. But we always found a way to work it out.  
  
Last week she texted me and said that she was calling it off. The reason that she gave was the increased tension led to her having doubts about the longevity of our relationship and she felt that calling it off now was better than waiting 2 years from now and trying the long distance for extended periods of time. She didn't like how bad a few of the days were when I would be upset. She told me that she didn't want to just take time and wait till the end of the summer and said that when she get's back she's contact. She said that she see's two possible outcomes when she get's back. Either she  was right and keeps it called off or she'll come back to me begging to get back together.

482,3as1yv,"My two older sisters pretty much raised me after our mother died when I was six. Our father took her death hard and his parental influence dissipated after her death. I was the kind of kid who was really close to his mother like I was always at her side. We did everthing together. I am grateful that my sisters stood up to make sure I was taken care of. 

I never dated throughout gradeschool. I was and still am very awkward. About four moths ago I met an amazing girl. We are now dating and she is my first girlfriend. I had never even held hands with a girl until her. She is everything I could ask for right now. She is a violinist like my mother was. She is kind, well grounded and has a good deal of relationship experience. I adore her and think she feels the same. We are getting pretty serious so I wanted my sisters to meet her. 

Yesterday she and I went to a brunch at my oldest sisters home. We had a great time and they really seemed to like her. Toward the end of the day my girlfriend seemed more silent I assumed she was just tired. I drove her home and she just seemed offish. She kissed me goodbye told me she had a nice time and that she would call me in the mourning. After what I thought was a great day the quickness of the exchange seemed odd. Still, I shrugged it off. I called my oldest sister to thank her again for hosting our brunch and to ask what she though of my girlfriend. Her response was kind of shocking. She told that she really liked her but that she did not think the relationship was a great idea. She said that her and my other sister agree that my girlfriend is clearly more grounded and experienced than I am and that I am not ready for this kind of relationship. She said that I could end up just bringing her down with my lack of social experience, that she deserved someone who can relate to her and her needs... To go even futhur she informed me that while my sisters and girlfriend had a girltalk (what?) that they voiced their concerns to her. I am stunned that my sisters would do this. I have never thought of them as the types to intrude on my life. 

I tried calling my girlfriend right when I hung up the phone on my conversation with my sister but she did not answer. She texted me and told me that we would talk in the mourning and that she was exhausted. Well, we talked this mourning and she is upset about what my sisters said to her. She assured me that she thinks they are being ridiculous and that she loves the dynamic of our relationship. She is a dominant person while I am fairly submissive. She told me that she enjoys being able to guide me into what is unfamiliar for me. That is what I love about her. She makes me feel safe and gives me sense of social direction.

So our relationship is very safe but we are both taken backthe behavior of my sisters. I understand that they care about me but it feels like they are trying to control me.

950,3fqf17,"Like the title mentions, lately I don't like kissing my husband so much. I love him very much, but it's a lack of trust with some other issues leading to this. I know that he would like more intimacy.....I just can't give it. 

We haven't been married long, but the trust is absolutely not there. He outright lies about things, he is dishonest about even small things just really stupid things. We have spoken about this on numerous occasions and I have honestly contemplated leaving him over it. Trust is very important to me, and i go out of my way to be transparent, I just don't understand why he is with me if he doesn't plan on giving 100% to the relationship. For example, the past week or two he has been furiously texting away, and I asked who he has been texting. His response was something on the lines of uh...no one. And that was the end of the conversation. We have had issues with this in the past, and vowed honesty in the aftermath. I am not accusing him of anything and with no plans to snoop, I just don't get why he can't just say I'm texting XYZ person because if it is nothing then it won't matter. Its just the transparency aspect. My phone is always available, he probably uses it more than I do. I don't carry it around with me or any secretive shit because I have nothing to hide. He on the other hand can't go to the bathroom without it. If it's charging, he will unplug it and take it with him. That and the texting don't really add up to anything good.

He is stupidly dishonest, he will lie about how much money he spent on something, knowing I can just go online and check. He spends more than I do, and often goes overboard. We don't make enough to support his spending habits, but he will always try and justify it with bs and then say he will handle the finances. Obviously there is a lot if resentment from him being irresponsible and then if that wasn't bad enough, he lies to cover it up.

All of this has lead to a steady decline in what used to be a very affectionate relationship. I just don't crave the intimacy the way I used to. The physical attraction is still there, we even have great sex sometimes. In general though, I find myself avoiding his kisses a lot and sometimes he will go in for a kiss and I'll give him a peck and leave. I don't really feel much about this, we have talked about the fact that for me a lot if intimacy is mental and knowing I can put all my trust in someone. Even with that knowledge he is still hesitant to be honest with me with a lot of things, and also constantly mentions how we don't kiss anymore and he wishes I would give him more than a peck. My feeling is that my needs aren't met, and sometimes it just seems like blatantly ignoring my needs while asking for intimacy. I feel as if he just wants to take take take from this relationship, but I refuse to always be giving if it is all for nothing.


Now we are at a point where neither of us is conpletely satisfied, but only I am very dissatisfied.

Things were going fine, but we were long distance, and I didn't think we were right for eachother. It was pretty hard, but I got over it, and we are now friends talking honestly, and she is helping me with this current situation.  

2 months later (December), I went to a my schools Atheism/Agnosticism club for the first time, and chatted with a girl after the club for over an hour and a half. We talked really well, and I was pretty interested in her. We exchanged numbers, and found out we grew up really close together. That weekend, we went to dinner, I made a joke about paying for the meal, in exchange for sex (to test her sense of humor, and also gauge her opinion on that kind of stuff), and she thought it was hilarious and insisted on paying for her meal. We go home, and talk for 3 hours, and eventually I ask so when am i taking you home. and she responds I don't know, I figured we would be making out by now. So we have sex, and have great pillow talk with a lot of giggling and fun. So yeah, it was pretty great. 

She tells me she likes me a lot, but doesn't like the idea of calling us boyfriend and girlfriend, because of the all the assumptions it causes. And I get that. We continue dating and I fall madly in love with her. Sure it was 7 months total, but that was how I felt. We were so good at working out problems, we gave eachother plenty of space, yadda yadda yadda. I thought it was amazing, and I thought she did too. 

Fast forward to 7/8/15. We have a small fight about her saying something inappropriate to me, and hurting my feelings. She defended herself at first, but later admitted it was her wrong. She ended up leaving, because she felt so bad about it, and I let her go because hey that's what we were good at doing. 

She ended up going home that weekend so we didn't get a chance to see eachother and have closure, but we texted and spoke on the phone and it seemed like it would be okay. She did seem off, but I just thought she still was upset. 

This Tuesday she is back in town, and calls me asking if she can come over. She sounds pretty distraught on the phone, but I just thought it was the fight. When she inside, it seems even worse, and we go upstairs to my room, and she says she has chlamydia. and I understand if you never want to talk to me again.  I didn't feel that way, because she had told me she had gotten tested once before we started dating, and once while we were dating, so I gave her the benefit of the doubt, and wasn't that mad at her. 

Then after more talking about how my feelings are hurt by her not calling my her boyfriend, and from her parents not knowing. (she said her parents were too nosy and she didn't want them prying into her life about our relationship) 

I said I don't want to ask this, but you didn't cheat on me did you


tl;dr cheated on by the girl I loved. feel completely betrayed. horrible anxiety and depression. 
She said she did and I asked why she didn't tell me during the chlamydia discussion. And she says I was waiting for you to ask.

Anyway, sorry for the probably horribly written wall of text. Hard to think about what was important and what wasn't.

65,303j9t,"We have been married for only 3 years (no kids), though we dated much longer than that.  We were sexually intimate long before we married and I think sex was much better when we first started out.  Looking back, perhaps it was just new and forbidden.  In the past year or so, we have *approximately* sex about once a week.


My wife seldom if ever initiates sex - she has never tried to seduce me nor does she make me feel wanted.  She does not like to try new things, nor does she really... participate.  Nine times out of ten, its missionary style with her on the bottom remaining more or less motionless and silent.


We recently had a very long discussion about our problems in the bedroom.  We both agreed that we don't enjoy sex with each other (2/10 - would not recommend).  She told me she has never enjoyed sex saying it has never been fun or special.  She also compared it to eating paper and said she doesn't want to have sex with me :(  Sex is a just another, unpleasant household chore.


I do have my faults, but I have honestly tried to improve the situation- romance, expensive lingerie, toys, with no luck.  On multiple occasions, I have asked her what I can do better (both sexy and clinical) and she never answers.  During sex, I may ask her if she likes what I'm doing and she doesn't respond.  Its impossible to improve with no feedback.  I told her as much, and she said pillow talk for her would amount to that feels OK, I guess.  She does orgasm every time we have sex, but it is only through masturbation or a vibrator.  Sex is tantamount to masturbation for the both of us.


I will mention that I'm in fairly good shape and at the very least, I do not believe myself to be horrendously ugly.  We do have some stress in our life over her work.  I recently left a high paying job to pursue my own business.  She has stayed at a job she hates to support us until I can pay the bills.  I can work from anywhere and will gladly relocate nearly anywhere in the country for her, but she hasn't found another job yet.  I will also mention that I really, really don't think she is gay.  She also says she isn't.


Maybe, maybe non-perfunctory sex once a week would be OK.  As it is right now, sex just breeds resentment.  I resent her for making me de facto beg.  We both resent each other for the bad sex, and she resents me for asking.  On a couple of occasions, I tried giving her space.  I gave up the first time after two or three weeks.  On the other occasion, she did approach me, but sex was no better.


She has suggested we get some professional help.  She also asked me to help out around the house more.  I'm reluctant to go to counseling because I don't believe a third party can talk her into enjoying sex.  I'm now doing more housework.  I highly doubt an open relationship would work for us.

1090,1xe1ft,"I'm going to try to make this as short as possible, but it's hard to summarize three years. Basically the problems I will list are problems we've been having pretty much the whole time.

She cries, all the time, over everything. It pisses me off. Nay, it infuriates me. I wish it didn't. In fact, it didn't at first. At first, I was the loving, caring, listen to your feelings and try to help you with it type of boyfriend. But then...I realized it was over EVERYTHING. My pillow isn't firm enough, crying. It's too cold out in my mini skirt, tank top, and 30F weather, crying. You didn't do exactly what I wanted exactly how I wanted, crying. It's gotten to the point where like I said, it literally infuriates me and I feel like a horrible person for it. I used to really mean about it, but I'm starting to get better. She is not.

Trust. Okay, we both have trust issues. I will also say though that I have become vindictive, and start doing the things she does to me to try to show her how it feels. Yes, I know this is wrong, but it is a last resort sort of thing. I have tried all other possibilities that I know of. I get a text message, she climbs over me, pushes my hand away, almost FIGHTS me to get to my phone first to see who it is. I get a call that's not in my phone, she checks hers to see if it is anyone she knows and I'm trying to hide it. 

Sex. Good god, the sex is just awful. She hasn't made me orgasm in about two years, while I give her orgasm after orgasm. Now don't get me wrong, I can make sweet slow passionate love to a woman. I can be romantic. I can be all that. In fact, I love doing it. But without getting too vulgar, I also like to break the bed. I like to explore possibilities, and make each other feel great. She claims to want the same, but every time I try to act on her fantasies or mine, she starts to cry, tell me to slow down, tell me to not do it as hard, tell me she is scared. I mean, it's just confusing.

Finally, she just doesn't know how to listen. Like in bed, just as an example. When she is trying to jerk me off and I'm not hard yet, she's going at it like I'm about to orgasm. My balls become a punching bag. I tell her time and time again that it hurts and to go slow at first, but she just keeps on doing it. Or, for a non sexual example, she is just flat out mean to me in front of anyone. Then she is all buddy buddy and nice to everyone else. I ask her about it, and tell her she is hurting my feelings and everyone feels kinda awkward when she does it. She tells me she won't do it again, and then what happens? She does it again

As you can probably imagine, this is just the tip of the ice berg. But I just wanted to give an overview rather than each individual incident. I love her, and that's why I haven't left for good (I've tried twice now, and each time she tries fucking one of my friends and I get jealous). Please help me, I can feel myself turning into her and she is driving me crazy. I just can't seem to get her mind to click or whatever. Her friends, my friends, my therapists because of her all tell me she is the one that is at fault and needs help. But that doesn't do me any good. I just want to know if anyone else has had any experience in this kind of relationship and knows what I can do to help her

254,2r0ma7,"My partner and I have been together for six years and have been living together for three. Our relationship was a little rocky at the beginning due to our age and my lack of relationship experience but it settled down around 3/4 years ago and has been smooth sailing ever since. We actually never fight and he really makes my life ridiculously more enjoyable. I know with all my heart that James is 100% in love with me... He tells me every day. I know he's really happy with our relationship. 

He is genuinely a great partner as he is calm, clean, happy, affectionate, considerate and puts up with me! I can be very forgetful and clumsy but he's always very understanding and encouraging. I could talk about how amazing he is all night!!

Obviously we've spoken about marriage. We both say that we want to get married and have a family. I know I want it a little sooner than him but he's aware that it's time to start thinking about it. He's a little over the constant questions about why we're not engaged yet (from friends, family and me).

The biggest thing holding him back (he says) is money. James isn't great at saving money plus he has to pay his own tax, super etc... it doesn't leave a lot of extra money by the end of the week. I earn a little more than him but I'm great at budgeting and saving plus I don't have the expenses. We also keep our money separate as it works for us. 

I know a LOT of people will disagree with this but I also don't want him to propose without a ring. I want a decent ring and the ones I like are around $4000-$5000. It sounds selfish but I'm going to wear it for the rest of my life and I want something I love. James knows this. He also knows that I'm currently saving a deposit to buy us a house (he's helping but I have a lot more than him). I think spending that much on a ring is fair as I will pay much more towards the house. He also agrees that it's fair.

The problem is that he hasn't even started saving for one. I know this for a fact. Our dog needed emergency surgery which was expensive and we couldn't take money out of the house saving account so we had to take it out of our personal savings account....He had nothing in his. Seriously nothing.. so I payed and he saved up his half ($1000) to pay me back. I was extremely shocked. I thought he would have at least started saving. I also know for sure that he hasn't already bought one because we agreed that it would be made out of my grandmothers gold which I still have... So yeah. He's not even thinking about it.

I find the whole thing extremely frustrating but I have no idea what to do. I have spoken to him soooooo many times about getting married that I know he's well and truly over talking about it... But it's killing me. I feel so ready to take our relationship to the next level but it's not happening. Everyone asks when we're going to get married and it makes me uncomfortable because I thought it would have happened by now. 

I don't understand why he's not doing it. I feel like maybe it's my fault because I want a expensive ring but he's had SIX years to save for it!? He also likes to buy lots of gadgets and trinkets which he LOVES to play around with in his spare time but I'm becoming increasingly more aware of it as I feel like he should be saving that money but I also feel like I have no right to tell him what to do. Am I being selfish? Is he being lazy/unfair? 

Please give me some advice on what I should do. 

tl;dr Boyfriend of six years hasn't proposed or started to plan anything. I I feel neglected and pathetic. Not sure how to go about it or if I'm just being ridiculous.


EDIT: I'm sorry that I'm coming across as very materialistic and I probably need to clear a few things up but I also need to hear what everyone is saying.  I didn't filter my post and was honest because I wanted honest advice. 

I should have added that the reason I want such an expensive ring is because I want a replica of my grandmothers ring made with her gold. I always admired it when I was younger and wanted the same one. She passed away just before I met James and my Aunty inherited the ring. It would cost about that much to get it made. I also don't live in america and rings are generally more expensive here. 

My grandparents had a solid, loving marriage. I always hoped I would find someone I loved as much as she loved my grandad. James is that someone.

Also I don't care about a big wedding. I would happily have a backyard one as long as my family were there. ",I'm (25F) extremely frustrated that I'm not engaged to my bf (27).

In the past few days, I've discovered something shocking; he's been sending emails with pictures of himself in his underwear to another man online. That's shocking enough. But not just any other man - it's the mayor of our town.

I've seen the emails that he sent; they're hardly raunchy, or sex-filled, just very bland convos e.g. How was your weekend etc.?, with pictures of himself in his underwear attached, and the mayor emailing pictures back.

He's never actually met the mayor in person, nor arranged to meet him, only ever seen pictures of him in the local papers.

The mayor's got a wife and kids, I know about this, he's mentioned about them in the local papers.

Even worse, he used our family email account (i.e. familyname at isp.com) to do it, not a personal webmail. And the emails from the mayor... from his official email address too.
I found all his emails hidden in a folder on our webmail in the innocuosly-named personalemailbusiness1.

I confronted him yesterday over it and we had a blazing row, he insisted it was just a bit of fun, there was no sexual element to it, and that he wasn't gay.

If he isn't gay or bisexual, then why the hell is he sending emails wih pictures of himself in underwear and picswapping with the mayor?

I'm struggling to cope here; what do I do?

If I tell the Mayor's wife, I'll be dismissed as a crank and won't be believed, but if I don't, it'll be like she doesn't know, what should I do?

I feel like I could or should divorce him, but emotions are rushing through right now, it's making me tense, stressed and nervous.

OK, so he didn't cheat on me physically, but he did emotionally and that's upsetting me a lot.

He insists to me he's not gay or bisexual, and it was only a bit of fun, but if I did the same thing with another man or woman, he'd probably read me the riot act, rant at me, yell at me.

This whole behaviour of his seems questionable, and how he managed to hide it from me, I don't know.

He's supposed to be a husband and a father, not acting like a single man, or even a single gay or bi man for that matter, and this concerns me a lot.

I have to remain calm, think about my son.

Any insight and perspective would be greatly appreciated, thanks.

1145,2hvs60,"I work in a bar and recently a coworker has not been pulling her weight and sitting down and avoiding duties at most opportunities. Now I don't actually have any shifts with her but have to take over from her and the place is usually a mess. More importantly, other coworkers have been having more trouble with her than me but we are all good friends and nobody wants to be singled out as the one who made the complaint.

We have tried to get her to be more active but she usually finds ways to look busy and pretend to comply. We have let it go on for a couple of months and it seems to be getting worse and she has been going in huffs with people who complain to her. So we didn't just go straight to our boss. And even making a complaint, our boss is quite understanding and would make an effort if we had problems.

So yesterday we decided something had to be said and we made a decision as a group to let our boss know. I convinced people to leave out the things that would actually get her in trouble and to just make it seem like she wasn't pulling her weight.

Today I have just got texts saying things like I thought we were friends and I am under a lot of pressure and nobody thought to ask. Now nobody thought there was anything wrong with her, she is always upbeat and it was even a little hard to take how upbeat she was as if there was nothing wrong with her laziness. As I said our boss is understanding and if she went to her saying that then there would not be a problem but we would still need someone to work the same amount as the rest of us on busy days.

I understand being at work and being stressed out to hell as I have been on the verge of breaking down there but I don't understand making everyone else the bad guys when everyone is willing to listen and understand. I don't know how to go about this as she is important to all of us there. Even if she turns out to be just taking advantage of us we still have to work with her for the foreseeable future.

So, here is my side of the story.

It started of awkwardly, as most relationships do. As time passed we fell in love. I knew that she was much more into me than I was into her, but it didnt matter... I kept it going. I loved her. Things stayed steady for an entire year.

I should mention at this point that this girl I had fallen for was schizophrenic, manic depressive, suffered from severe insomnia, and a bit of a keptomaniac... 
But the biggest one was the Schizophrenia.

She would tell me about the people she would talk to, the voices she heard, and the things she would see. When our relationship started getting strained a new character started showing up to her. A tall skinny man with cloth wrapped around his wrists and arms, a dark face. He would tell her to do horrible things to herself.

Things finally ended when we were at a public event and she tried to kill herself. I had to call the police on her and have her taken to the psychiatric facility. We were still together while she was in there... However she started treating me terribly. Telling me I was worth nothing to her anymore for trying to stop her. After about a week of trying to support her but just constantly being put down, I gave up and cut her off.

She is now homeless... and I feel like its kind of my fault She lives downtown with the other homeless people, sometimes down by the river. She goes in and out of Psychiatric Facilities and in and out of the drunk tank. I want to help her. I still care, though I dont love her anymore. 

Every once in a while she will find her way to a computer and message me something SERIOUSLY crazy. She continues to be obsessed with me (its been over a year). The last time I heard from her she told me that she thought that my friend and I, together, formed god. And that she was a Jesus-like figure to spread the word that we have.

The problem is this:
When I ended things while she was in the Psych Unit, a lot of her old friends judged me and judged me hard. They said it was the worst thing I could have ever done and I was garbage for doing it.

Another problem was  that my family and a lot of my friends began to hate her (or at least not want me to be with her or around her), so when I went to help her, everyone advised me against it. In fact they almost held me back.

I am now in a relationship with a beautiful girl. A girl I love so much more than I ever loved my now crazy ex. But I still have this want to help her out. I have met up with her a couple times, given her toilet paper, tampons, old clothes.

Would you help even if everyone didnt want you to?

613,1oqgiq,"At the beginning of my relationship with my SO, I established some conditions. Having been a virgin when we got together, I said I would not be comfortable about his former hook-ups hanging around. I am, unfortunately but naturally, an insecure person. I am a lot more confident now that I was then. My SO agreed to this condition and thought it was fair enough. There is a girl in his circle of friends who has made her rounds with most of the guys in the group. To be honest, I found her very threatening. She had a lot more in common with my SO than I did and I was away at school an hour away and she hung out with him a lot. Because she had basically slept with all his friends, I asked if he had ever been with her before. He denied it and promised to let me know if she ever tried to make a fool of herself by making any moves on him. I take his word for it, though I am very suspicious. While at school, I was horribly depressed by the thought of her hanging out around him. It wasn't too far fetched for me to think she would try to go after him because he's a great guy and kind of the alpha of his group (for lack of a better word). It made me awfully uncomfortable, especially since my SO was not all that great about keeping in touch. He had excuses like no phone, internet, or car- he was pretty much living in poverty. I always told myself that I trusted him but not her. In retrospect, I realize that I probably didn't trust him either. 

So fast forward a few years, we're living together happily. Here is the part where *I* become the villain and everyone forgets about how I was wronged. I went through his facebook. Not because I did not trust him. Really it was just out of curiosity; but again, in retrospect, there was probably some trust issues involved since I've always been suspicious about this girl friend of his. I went through their messages- I know invasion of privacy is awful. It started out pretty innocent but I kept looking farther back because they were talking about some interesting gossip involving her and the various guys in the group she had relations of one kind of another. But then vindication. I see messages of them saying how they were jealous of seeing each other with other people (this is at the beginning of our relationship); how he loved the smell of her on his sweater and how cute she looked sleeping in it; how she didn't want her boyfriend at the time (his roommate) finding out they had hooked up but it was okay though, because he got a friend (cue me) to get in a facebook relationship with him. WHOA! It all hit me hard and I was full of nothing but rage. 


The things that followed are things I am not proud of. I got drunk and confronted him. He actually tried to lie about it again. He put on an I don't know what you're talking about face on but then I showed him the messages and he slumped and confessed. I think the worst part about this whole thing is that he knew how I felt about her and never tried to cut her out. I tried really hard to be friends with her so that it might help me feel better but I could never get over the suspicion I had of them. If he had just cut her out of the picture this would've never been a problem. She would've just been another girl in his past. He said he couldn't really do that though because, well, she stayed relevant to the group by sleeping with every other guy in their circle. But I called bullshit on that excuse because he hung out with her a lot without other people. 

A lot of other people I've talked to about this say I had no right telling him who he could and could not hang out with and I think that's a fair point. But he should've grown a pair and told me that's how he felt but he didn't. He just lied and hoped I would never find out. I was very explicit about this particular issue with him about her before I found out. I said I thought her behavior was a bit ratchet, the whole thing was quite incestuous, and that I would leave him if I found out he had ever been with her because I thought that would be disgusting. I'm all for people sleeping with whoever they want and all around the block- their body their business- but like I admitted before, I am an insecure person and had some trust issues with my SO (and I think people should give me some credit for being honest about this before they pick on the details). 

When I confronted him I demanded to know what else he lied about. He admitted that while I was in school, he had more money than he led on but never made an effort to use it to be better about staying in touch. I really should have left him a long long long long time ago. We should've never survived our first year together. But we've been together five years now and things have gotten so much better between us over time. This past year has been the best. But now we're confronted with this issue. I know he means it when he says he's sorry. He claims he never hooked up with her after we started seeing each other, but again I'm suspicious about this claim and have every right to be considering. 

The fight happened about 2 months ago. Things between us are getting better. I still see him as the person I will spend the rest of my life with. The rage has subsided. But the trust is still not there. I've banned her from our life completely (much to the annoyance of our roommate who is tragically in love with her). I know he's not talking to her, but the lingering skepticism about his faithfulness at the beginning of our relationship keeps haunting me. I think about ending things, leaving him, and running away across the country on a daily basis. But the thought of not being with him just doesn't work for me. He's my best friend. He's a great boyfriend (with an exception of this debacle) who treats me like a queen. I just don't trust him anymore. I can see that he's trying really hard to fix it and I really want thing to work out. I really wish I could forgive him.

SO lied and I don't trust him anymore. Part of me wants to leave him but I mostly just wish I could forgive him so we can move on.

The entire time this was going on, my stepmother was facebooking vague memes about relationships, how if you love someone, let them go, how love actually is a type of insanity, or how love is an egoistic thing, etc. She also tagged me a couple times, and I removed the tags on her posts. A lot of these posts were liked or otherwise commented on by my ex. I can't 100% with surety say that they were all directed at me, but it surely did coincide with all the stuff going on and it was an enormous volume of posts, and a lot of smug comments from my ex. 

I emailed my stepmother and asked her, very nicely, hey, could you please stop posting all these things on facebook, because you're putting a lot of pressure on me, and you are feeding my ex with a lot of drama and opportunities to be smug, which is basically her favorite thing in the world.

She did not reply to this, but she did start to post things on facebook about not taking her posts personally, and that if you see yourself in something, that says more about you, etc.

I emailed her again, and called her on her shit, told her that if she was at all interested in having any sort of relationship with me, that she needed to cut her shit.

She finally emailed me back and said that she would 'stop posting anything I could see myself in' and that if my GF and I wanted to unfriend her on FB, she would be fine with that. Basically telling me I'm imagining things. I feel like this is some pretty extreme gaslighting.

Soooo, I cut off contact with her, but I feel very conflicted about it, and I feel bad about cutting off contact with my dad by proxy, because he wasn't participating in this bullshit. 

Just looking for some opinions about whether I'm being too sensitive about her shenanigans, or what. Thanks!

Apparently the BF said You should get her a big rock and propose on Christmas Day! I wasn't expecting he'd say something like that so we both just laughed and he was like I couldn't do that anyway because you won't even be in town Christmas Day (family vacation). So that was that.


I was at his house a couple weeks later and I was asking his cousin for suggestions for his Christmas presents, he was sitting right there. She thought for a second and threw out a couple things and then said, but I know what YOU want for Christmas! and pulled up a picture of a ring on FB I had liked at one point or another. I was slightly embarrassed (But really, what girl doesn't like those pics every now and then? It was innocent) and I shoved the phone away and said Omg, I don't want that! (and I was laughing). And then we started comparing our hand/finger sizes and then I was asked my ring size. (Honestly don't remember who asked) And again, that was that.

That weekend he comes to my house and we decide to go see a movie. I excused myself to the restroom, he was still talking to me through the door. I finish my business, wash my hands, and open the door to see him in my hallway down on one knee.... I said What are you doing?! I was seriously shocked to see him down there and he just started laughing and said I just wanted to play a trick on you.

402,2kcg58,"Here's a little background:

My boyfriend and I have been together for five years. We currently live in his mother's house (it's a duplex, so we live on one side and his family lives on the other). I'm still a student in school, so I only have time for a part time job, although I will be graduating in December. 

The biggest strain in my relationship is money. My SO owns his own business and has a steady stream of income. I, on the other hand, do not. My part time hours fluctuate and my paychecks vary. I am not slacking though... if I am not in class, there is a VERY good chance I am working, as I work every possible day that I can. The money imbalance has always been there, but I try to contribute as much as I can.

The only rent we have is just helping his mother pay for the mortage and bills. I do not pay his mother my rent, I pay my boyfriend, who actually pays most of the entire household bills. He's never been super upfront with me about detailed costs, but he says the mortage is around $3k and utilities are around $500. I always thought this was strangely high, but I never questioned out of fear of a fight.

I was making roughly $1000 a month with my part time job. My boyfriend and I decided it would be fair if I paid $400 every month for rent, this way I can contribute but I can also pay for my other bills, food, gas, etc. Note: my $400 is not NECESSARY for the bills to be paid. They will be paid no matter what, it's rather just so I can do my part. My boyfriend makes good money himself. 

Recently, my hours have been cut drastically. Now, I'm making about $500 a month. This has become a HUGE problem because my boyfriend does not understand. There is ZERO talking about it with him - every time I've tried to talk to him about it, he gets very angry and just demands his money. I told him I want to negotiate something... Since his $400 estimate was based on $1000, how about I give you half my paycheck now ($250) and once I get a better paying job post grad (or am able to go full time at my current job) I will obviously pay more. 

He literally WILL NOT LISTEN to me. He's told me things like I don't care if you have to be a hooker or sell drugs, I want my damn money. He's also physically thrown my clothes in the street because I was late on my payment (due to my pay schedule, not because I was procrastinating). I'm scared because finances are obviously a huge thing, and I want to be able to talk to something touchy without fear of being kicked out. This has become difficult because I have had to skip class because I did not have gas money to commute, meanwhile my boyfriend just bought the new iPhone 6+ (at retail cost) and a new camera for his playstation. 

The relationship itself isn't the healthiest. To be honest, I'm really hoping to find a decent paying job after graduation so maybe I can move out on my own or with a roommate. But for now, this is my struggle. Am I wrong for wanting to negotiate? What should I do? I live in a different state so moving back home or with a friend is not an option.

590,332lww,"My boyfriend and I have a great relationship. We like the same things and we're kind to each other, and we have so much fun together when we hang out, whether we're at a concert or curled up in flannel pyjamas and playing video games. We actually have more sex now than we did when we started dating. He's very kind to me, and has never called me a bad name or tried to hurt my feelings during a fight.

We made the decision to move in together in December, and now we're finally going to do it, after a lot of planning and deliberation (I've never lived on my own before, he has and does currently). He's very excited, and keeps on talking about all the great things we can do with the place and how lovely it will be to have each other around all the time.

I agree with him! I'm really excited as well. I love him, and I feel ready to live away from my parents. That said, I'm a little bit nervous, and not just because I think I'll miss them. They've been my primary support through my struggles with mental illness, and are pretty much the reason I'm alive today (and not just because they're my literal parents, hypothetical smart ass). 

I have bipolar type 2 disorder and general anxiety disorder (GAD), and my life since reaching adolescence has been pretty hectic. I've been in and out of hospitals for a good chunk of my life for various stupid decisions resulting from my bipolar. Even worse, I've yet to try a bipolar medication with benefits that outweigh its detrimental side effects (I'm very very unlucky). I have anti anxiety medication (Valium) and medical marijuana which I smoke to quiet some of the insanity if I'm experiencing hypomania or just having a tough time with anxiety. I also see a therapist weekly and attend weekly group dialectic behavioural therapy sessions.

Essentially I'm doing the best I can to keep everything under wraps, but bipolar isn't something that I can just control, as much as I like to think I can. It's debilitating and disrupts every aspect of my life, and living with me isn't easy. My boyfriend has seen me have panic attacks and extreme bipolar episodes on either side of the spectrum, and he's found it very disturbing and stressful. That's not to say that he isn't understanding; he does a great job of being understanding, but it's obvious that it shakes him up, and he's told me himself that it's sort of surreal to see me like that. 

Because of all this, I'm getting very very paranoid that things are going to go wrong. I've been internalizing my insanity with more effort than I've ever used before, which has been working with my boyfriend but has slipped out at home. I frequently have episodes of panic or racing, nonsensical paranoid thoughts bordering on delusions about my boyfriend realizing how awful I am to be with and leaving me. This has been a huge source of stress for me for the past month.

On top of all that, I'm going to be living in my own place for the first time in under 2 weeks! Holy fucking shit! I'd need advice even if I weren't a crazy person.

I just don't know what's going on or what to do or how to approach the coming months.

He fell in love with me quickly, but I told him I was married and just wanted to be friends, and he was able to accept that, while we continued our friendship. All the while, I felt torn between these two men in my life because I actually had feelings for them both (my husband, and this guy). I could talk to my friend about things that my husband never seemed to understand when I spoke to him about them. I'm quite a deep thinker, and so was this guy. We had lots of deep conversations. I really enjoyed it. Our friendship was a pretty poetic one. On the flipside, he had bipolar and sometimes he would say things that scared me.

398,281f40,"Believe it or not, this IS the brief version...


I've been with my gf for 6 years. When I met her, she already had a history of depression, but we always managed to weather the storms. About six months ago, she suddenly got much worse (due to family problems, I think), ended up in a psychiatric hospital, and then broke up with me after Christmas. She said she needed to focus on herself.


It was hard at first, but I forced myself to stay friends with her. She's drinking way too much, to the point of blacking out in the street, and I'm pretty sure she's having a casual relationship with this guy she knows. It's all a bit of a mess.


Anyway...


Recently, we had some good days together just hanging out, and she started talking about wanting stability, and about how good things used to be. I jokingly suggested a weekend away together in Rome, and to my surprise she agreed enthusiastically. I said we could have separate rooms, but she said she wanted us to share, and that if we got twin beds we could push them together. Fair enough, I was quite pleased by this development, and we went this weekend.


We had fun at first, and she was quite flirty, but when I tried to kiss her, she freaked out and said I was putting too much pressure on her, and that she was sorry if she'd led me on. Since we got back, she's treated me like I'm some kind of bad guy who misread her signals and ruined a fun trip.


I feel like I spend all my time thinking about how to fix things and help her, and although I used to be pretty carefree and relaxed, now I'm a bundle of stress.


So now I figure I've only got one option. I only moved to Germany to be with her, and although she wants me to stay around (and gets teary if I suggest I might leave), I think I'm going to move away and get on with my own life. With the job I do, I can work anywhere, so I figure I'll get a place by the beach in a decent-sized town, maybe somewhere in the south of France. I hope she'll decide she doesn't want to lose me, but I know there's a big chance she won't. Still, something needs to change, and nothing's going to change while she thinks I'm sitting here patiently waiting for her. If being her friend means watching her drink a six-pack and half a bottle of whiskey in a night, then I don't think I can do it.

Just typing this out has helped. If anyone's got any advice or comments, I'd love to hear!

A big issue for me is that he is still friends with 1 of his exes and hangs out with her (in a group, not one on one - as far as I know anyway) every few weeks. Yet, he insisted that I stop being friends with my ex [29M], I'll call him John. I figured it was for the good of our relationship so I complied. There are other things I'm unhappy with too, such as half his responses to me being I can do whatever I want! or I don't care, or him selling drugs for a time out of our house and getting fucked up every night, but that's a whole other can of worms, I'm just trying to give some context.

I ran into John this weekend. I was at a festival and got too drunk, he drove me home (2 hours away) and carried me into my house. He has always been there for me and this weekend's events have made me really miss him. I already was missing him, but this made it worse. He texted me afterwards wanting to hang out. 

I'm considering getting back together with John. But the problem is, I'm not physically attracted to him. Though, he's made me the happiest I've ever been in my life, I remember every day we've spent together vividly while everything else is a blur (I have anxiety and depression). The best day of my life was spent with John, just hanging out in a park together. And, he has seen me at my absolute worst (this weekend is a pretty good example) and still loves me and doesn't make me feel bad about myself, whereas Dave constantly berates me, saying things like why are you so stupid? and telling me I'm crazy because he knows I hate being called that due to my mental health issues.

I guess what I want to know is: is it worth getting into a relationship with someone you're not physically attracted to? In my experience, the guys that I've dated based on attraction have not lasted. I'm thinking that in the long term, maybe it's best to be with someone you really get along with emotionally, rather than just physically.

So i've been with my gf now for 8 months and im deeply in love with her. She has had previous bf's who where dicks to her and cheated on her, so she has trust issues. Before we started seeing each other, i used to party alot with my friends and was a bit involved with drugs. Nothing too serious and not too often.... this would happen about once or twice a month where we would go out usually MDMA, ketamine and sometimes coke. My gf is a bit of a good girl... shes never been around drugs at all... hasn't touched a cigarette.. none of her friends have been near them either. So she has never had to deal with them. All of this partying has stopped now though as im no longer a student and im working full time and to be honest ive just grown out of it. However my friends still go out from time to time on their binges and talk openly about it when we are all hanging out, and this freaks her out. me and my friends are completely normal but she now has labelled them as 'druggies' and looks down on them like they are the scum of the earth. 

We have had a talk/argument and she is a bit naive about the whole topic. she refuses to believe i dont take drugs anymore no matter what i say, and when ever i bring it up she gets mad. She is really uneducated about them... and it makes it really hard to defend myself when we talk about them. To sum up, she thinks anyone who touches a drug or experiments with them even once is basically a piece of shit.... and because my friends still take them and talk openly about them she assumes that im still taking them when im not! she had the same problem with smoking... which is fair enough, cause it is a bad habit and there aren't really alot of benefits to it. So i agreed to stop smoking (which i dont mind)

ANYWAY to make matters worse im now going to Amsterdam with my friends in february for a birthday.... she wants to have a 'talk' tonight. I think the whole drug topic is going to come up again and i dont know how to get through to her and defend myself. While we are out there im sure we will go to one of the cafe's for a smoke/space cake.... and im not prepared to lie to her and say that i wont have some weed out there. I understand her getting upset when i take heavy drugs like coke, but i am very pro-weed and i know for a fact that when taken in moderation that cannabis is harmless. It also doesnt help that prostitution is legal in amsterdam... so she probably thinks im going to sleep with a hooker as well. 

Im worried shes going to ask me not to go to Amsterdam... This is something i cant really back down from as i have already given up smoking for her... and my friends are aware that ive stopped going out partying with them now because she isnt cool with it... so im already 'whipped' according to them.

1033,1uf5ac,"So to get to the question, I really have to tell you the whole story.


A little over a year ago, a couple of buddies and myself went vacationing in Mexico. The last day we were there, I met a girl who invited me to a club that night. She gave me her number, I forgot to call her (although I had really wanted to see her), and when I got back to the states, received an sms from her. I texted her back, and one thing led to another and we end up skyping - several times a week for the next few months. I'd say February 2013 things cooled off and we went about our regular lives, despite getting pretty close over the preceding months.

We text very sporadically up until October. She casually suggests (as she has done before) that I come visit her. Well, lo-and-behold, I've just been dumped and was looking for a way to get my mind off it. I buy a ticket for mid-November. Mind you, at this point, the only time I've seen her in person was that half hour chat on vacation. Although we skyped quite a bit, and we knew some pretty intimate details about each other, it was still kinda nerve-racking.

I arrive in Mexico and for the week-plus time I'm there, we're inseparable. I've never hit it off with someone this easily before. I mean we don't leave each others' side the entire time I'm there. It's a blast! The morning I was originally scheduled to fly out, I call up my boss and tell him I'm going to be out a few more days. The thought of leaving her is too much and I shell out several hundred dollars to stay an extra two days. Worth it.

An aside...during the first run of our skype conversations, she mentions her ex-boyfriend. A Swedish guy she had dated for a few years. At the time, they were on a mutually-agreed upon break due to the distance. Well, when I went to see her, she told me she was quitting her (very good) job in December and moving to Sweden. That whole year, she had been applying for and getting a visa to live and work over there. I mean, she was pretty much set to uproot her life for this, albeit in a very planned and responsible way. She also tells me she bought a return ticket after two months in case it didn't work out.

Back to the main timeline. So with this knowledge, I head back to the States. At this point, I think it's safe to say we are head over heels for each other. We keep skyping, and I joke that she should come visit me on her way to Sweden. She buys a ticket to arrive here on Christmas day and stay for three days. Over the month leading up to her arrival, I halfheartedly try to get her to cancel, primarily because I know it will just escalate things further. I get worked up enough to legitimately tell her not to come the day before.

She does anyway. And it's another amazing, almost honeymoon-esque time together. At this point, I love you's have been exchanged for a month, sincerely. She tells me she doesn't want to go to Sweden, but has invested so much in making this happen that she can't call it off. That being said, she's apparently tried to tell her ex about us and he won't hear it. He believes her being there will change her mind and fix their relationship.

Thanks for bearing with me, up to this point. I realize its a long-winded post.


Anyways, as I'm dropping her off at the airport (about a week ago), she asks me how to tell him the full story about this/us. I just tell her to be gracious when she does, but to enjoy herself while she's over there and if we feel the same way when she gets back, then we can talk about us.

We know conversation will be limited, but we agree we both feel we can't go without contact for two months (at this point, she has been planning to use her return ticket). Over this past week, we've emailed back and forth a few times and briefly skyped once. I decide I can't be the guy on the side and tell her last night I'm through until I receive an email this morning...

She told him about us. He understandably freaks out and leaves. She is staying at his apartment. She may be homeless. What the fuck have I done and how do I handle this? I love her and eventually would want to be with her, but this escalated a lot quicker than I planned. Obviously I'm not going to drop her or anything, but how do I tread here?

*Apologizing for upcoming rant. This part is mainly going to be therapeutic for me.*

A broke up with me about a week ago, but I saw it coming since we were on the fence about what to do when college hits. He has always been the codependent one in our relationship with his anxiety/depression issues. I have been more independent/career-orientated/really happy with who I am. Anyways, after being so wishy-washy about what to do when college hits I finally decided, eff it I'm just going to go to (the same) college with him and see what happens when we get there.

Well apparently everyone (and I mean a lot of people including family, friends, hell he even asked my wonderful open parents for advice) suggested that we should spend some time away for each other, so he broke up with me with the intention he would change over the summer (finally convinced him to get therapy, even though he still feels like nothing is wrong with him) and we would magically get together at the end of summer. I did not know that this was just a break until a few days ago.

I am in crazy love with this guy. He's my first love, and the first one I saw a future with. He is normally sweet but when he freaks out shit gets bad. Suddenly, when I mention that *I* am starting to get over our breakup that HE INITIATED he thinks that suddenly I don't care, that I have to decide right there on the spot whether I want to just give-up on any chance of us being together in the future.

According to him, I am the influencing factor on whether or not he gets over me. And by golly, I want him to get over me because he is not handling it well. At all. Like crying all the time not well while I'm spending more time with my family before I head off to Uni.

Why can't he understand that I don't want to be needed? That he feels perfect except for all of this codependency crap, all this no gray areas? He goes from too clingy to too distanced. Neither are really making him happy.

We were in relationship for 3 years IRL and 6 months ago I moved out to other side of the planet and we agreed to be in long distance relationship. I'm planning to come back to visit him in 6 months. I can say that he's pretty insecure and has low self-esteem issues. We had down and up and he currently has some trust issues with me (I didn't cheat on him or anything like that, it's just small things here and there that I bullshitted something to avoid arguments) but things are going normally.

I'm a freelancer and one of my client who deal with payment transaction between me and his company, we got known to each other. He figured out that I'm a massive fan of my NFL team, but I've never been to the game, usually because tickets are very expensive. He promised that he'll get me tickets to the NFL game which will be in a month. My boyfriend figured that out and reacted badly, telling me something like I'd go out with this guy and fuck him. Because of that, I rejected his offer to buy me tickets and let my boyfriend know that I will not go.

Few weeks later, the guy sent me two tickets, one for me and another I can invite whoever I want. He told me that he promised me those tickets and that's why he bought it and it's up to me to go or not to go. I invited my dad and he's already totally pumped to go with me and that guy. I think this guy is a little creepy, but it won't hurt if I go with my dad, right?

I didn't let my boyfriend to know about this. I definitely have to go, my dad is going with me and I'm a fan of the game. I don't know how to approach my boyfriend, whether if I should tell him or not? There's high chance that he'll overreact if I told him that I'll be going and he'll think that I'll fuck this guy (he's so insecure) and, most likely, he'll be very jealous. Hell, things could be even better if I just don't tell him.

I know that this is boring and I am changing. We almost never talk by Whatsapp anymore because I've been trying not to ask too much these things.

She is also changing. She is a little bit rude when talking via internet and non-sentimental. She is very direct when talking with me via wpp although she is very romantic when we are face-to-face.

626,2jmmaq,"Lets call her Bek. We met in high school, and fell for each other hard, but there was too much age difference at that point in our lives. We agreed to see other people and live our own lives until we were older. 

Time went by, and we just drifted farther apart. We both got caught up in other relationships and seemed to just barely miss each other, again and again. Ten years later, 2011, we finally found each other again. It was wonderful. Perfect bliss. Almost as though we were two strange and rejected puzzle pieces that only fit each other. In my heart, I finally settled down for good. Started putting down roots, ones that intertwined with hers. We both wholeheartedly agreed that after a year or two, one of us would propose.

She always loved writing stories, and online roleplay. Fantastical things like vampires, assassins, and the like. One day, she left Yahoo Messenger open and logged in on my computer and went to work. Well, I looked. I know, I know. As it turns out, there was a guy named Jesse several states away that she had been mildly flirting with. Not a big deal. I joked with her later that day when she logged on the computer, don't forget to remind Jesse you're out of his league, and she went pale. Started apologizing profusely, please don't leave me, it's just flirting, I'll never do it again... And I'm reassuring her, baby it's ok, not a big deal, it's words on a screen. No nudes, making plans, or I love you's and it's okay with me. I was stupid.

A week later he calls. I answer the number I don't recognize. His attitude was something like 'oh, it's the dude. Put Bek on the phone.' Then I got mad. I told him no more or I would come knock on his door, etc. It was a done deal. No more Jesse. We have a discussion about it, move on, and remain happy and uninterrupted for two years more. She gains weight, loses self-esteem, I stay about the same, we both change jobs, rent a nicer place in a great neighborhood.

September 2012, Skype shows up on the computer. At this point she had given up roleplay stories, and hadn't written since the Jesse guy. But things were starting to happen, such as me waking up in the middle of the night and she's in the living room talking on the phone to someone, I gotta go -click-, type of thing. Every time I would 'catch' her doing something like that, she would be kind of sullen and irritable for a couple of days. She started spending more and more time with the laptop, and less and less with me and her son (now 6.5yrs). I mean 5+ hours a day. On a workday. On her days off, it's from the time she would wake until long after I went to bed.

Needless to say, the quality of our sex life had been fluctuating for a while at that point. Hard to be intimate with a laptop between us. I would discover three more men, all living far away, that she had been writing erotica with, webcamming with sexually over Skype, talking and texting, stalking and sexting, and giving her family time to. I had been holding on really hard because her son completely regards me as a father, calls me daddy, and we do everything together. His bio dad is a p.o.s.

About this time last year, I finally blew up. Woke her out of bed, called her every variation of the word whore, a deluded, skype-addicted, family neglecting webslut living in a roleplay fantasy land instead of right here with a man who loves her and a son who needs her. She broke down, and decided she didn't want to lose her family.

She legitimately changed, stopped roleplaying and skype-cheating, and really seemed to become the Bek I always loved once again. By December 2013, I had proposed, just like I said. I put a ring on her finger, and she said yes. Come tax season 2014, we would be wed. We told all our friends and family, started making plans. We did it. We made it. We were happy again.

We decided to postpone the actual wedding for another year, so that we could have the one we always wanted. By April 2014, she called it off entirely. Said we just weren't ready. We were still happy with each other, just not ready for marriage, apparently. Our relationship started to deteriorate again, and worse. I started drinking. She gained more weight, her self esteem plummeted, and she became glued to the laptop screen again. I started drinking myself to sleep every night.

August 20th this year, she leaves her account open on facebook. She and a guy named Jeremy, as well as a guy named Joseph had been flirting and I assume skype-sexing. Strange how these are all j names, even mine. On the 24th August, she says she needs her space and independence, and one of us needs to move. At first, I am crushed. Now, things are just very strange.

We're still living together, but in mid November I'm moving out to a place I own in the country. Between the time we decided to split and now, our relationship has become wonderful again. I turn a blind eye/ignore it when she skypes (and die a little on the inside). Sex has become exciting for us again, we go do things, laugh and play, like I always wanted for us. Our relationship feels like taking a terminal cancer patient out for their bucket list before they die, everything behind us and nothing in the future.

Actually reading my own writing here, I look like the biggest pathetic pushover in the history of doormats. A smart guy would have dumped her three years ago. I'm disgusted by her but god I love her still. We find ourselves talking about things that we're going to do together while living apart, how dating from separate lives might rekindle the fire. 

I just found out that she had been 'in love' (she says in her posts) with the 'Joseph Martinez' guy since just after I proposed. She's 5 years older than him, has never met him, he lives far away, and I swear to god has a face like porky pig. Wow. Such a big part of me wants to copy and paste some of this b.s. they type to each other, post up their pictures, names, facebook accounts. Expose her as the quintessential slut that she has made herself into. But I'm not that kind of piece of s___. I do business in the present, waking world.

So now, my focus is on starting my new life far out in the country, where I can hunt and fish to my hearts content, have practically no bills, and be, well, very very alone.

Thanks for listening guys. And remember - Skype is evil and helps ruin families.

EDIT: Well, I just found out she and this dude have been planning to meet and fuck in november, probably the day I move out. Thanks for the advice guys. I got no more heart left to break.

We go to a big college. An SEC school. My freshman year, I got really sick (mono) quite early and missed out on that window where everyone is making friends. I still had a few close friends, which suited me because I am introverted, but it was mostly just high school people who also went to our college. At the beginning of this new school year, a girl reached out to me on tumblr saying we should hang out. Ok! New friends! I hung out with her a some of her friends. Immediately, I realized that these girls partied way more than me. I have had a boyfriend for about 2 years, and partied myself to death in high school to where alcohol has lost its appeal somewhat, particularly in the spiked drink frat house kind of vibe our school has. They also weren't about college relationships, telling me to dump my boyfriend the first time they heard about a little argument we had. 



But I digress, I wanted friends! Hanging out for us was going to parties on weekends. I guess the first time I thought Hmmm maybe this isn't my kinda crowd, was the first time I turned down going to a party to study. The friend called me lame and joked that I had no friends because I studied with my boyfriend on the weekends. (Probably true. But I just switched to a difficult major, am taking 18 credits, and I had a test that monday, so I couldn't not study.)  I guess for the sake of brevity our friendship was pretty much us going to parties, me babysitting them by the end of the night, and then laughing about it the next day. This went on for a couple months. 

Then, at the start of this semester, things went down hill. My friend introduced my roommate and I to a friend group she met. We all really hit it off and had a good time. My friend was kind of a link between them and me because I didn't get their numbers at first. When I did, my friend said, But now I can't be the leader anymore!  I feel bad, I didn't realize I was overstepping but reaching out to be friends beyond that of my friend's initial link. My friend started hanging out with them pretty much everyday, and it turns out that her and one of the guys were talking. 

One weekend my friend threw a party at her apartment. She was black out drunk by 11 pm when I showed up and most people hadn't even shown up yet. She was throwing up by midnight and her guy stayed to take care of her all night. That's nice, right? I figured they were about to start dating. 

Then I mentioned the next week that I wanted to invite the group over for a friday night. My friend told me that she now hated  the guy, but that we should invite everyone else over to show that she just was mad at him and not the group.  I asked what happened, and she brushed it off and said it wasn't a big deal/worth discussing. As it turns out, my friend went home that weekend and the group invited me over instead for a party. My friend was not invited.


Pictures of this hang out ended up on tumblr, I guess. My friend saw this and posted something really rude directed at us that I will not say here because of how recognizable it was. I knew this post was about us/primarily me because I had reblogged the pictures, but decided to disregard it until the group brought it up. I'm passive obviously . They got pissed, and basically decided she wasn't worth their time. I wanted to give my friend the benefit of the doubt mostly because I don't have a lot of girl friends. 


Since that night, about a month ago, that friend has had minimal contact with me directly. I have texted her in a group message and received minimal response to none. She thinks that I am the reason the group dislikes her, and is angry that I hung out with them after she had claimed them and it was a betrayal to do so if she wasn't involved/invited. Of course she hasn't said all this in so many words but that is what I have deduced. I wouldn't have gone to the party at all  if I had thought that this guy she was talking to in the group had hurt her, but she had said it wasn't a big deal. 


She posted something on tumblr about removing toxic people from her life, and tagged me in it. In the past month prior to this she had talked about being depressed, and if you're unfamiliar with tumblr there is a big your feelings are valid, cut out people who do things you don't like movement. Which I agree with! But I don't know how I hurt her, I really don't. And a lot of people take this movement as cut people out if they don't do what you want them to do. and I'm afraid that's what has happened. I have reached out and got nothing back.

After this, I asked the guy what exactly happened between my friend and himself. I thought maybe he had done something really bad to her and she thought that I knew and was ignoring it/not taking her side. I've dealt with rape, sexual assault, all that. I was so worried thats what happened and she was downplaying it. The reason she hates him? He took 10 minutes to text back when she texted him saying she needed someone to talk to. He apologized and she didn't accept it. 


She is now saying mean things about me and my boyfriend on social media and to people at school. (Subtle things like nobody cares about your boyfriend tbh and you act like studying makes you smarter than everyone) And these are based on things I put on my tumblr, my blog, stuff like being nervous for a test or a picture from our anniversary. Is me posting things like that wrong? I know she is depressed and not into relationships and felt left out from that one thing, but I don't know why I am being singled out in this. She is starting to tell mutual acquaintances from classes that I am a toxic person as well and I'm so hurt and confused more than anything. I had a few close dorky orchestra AP friends in high school but a lot of acquaintances, so I don't have a ton of experience with drama and confrontation within friend groups. Reading back over this I kind of feel like she is just a shitty person. But I still want some outside perspective because I must have done something wrong here for her to being saying I'm toxic, right?

Now I used to smoke weed before we dated and she used to drink(I'm not sure if this is like wasted drinking or just her wanting to be tipsy drunk). I've never really liked drinkers but I made an exception for her cause I really liked her. And she doesn't like smoking...so we had this dilemma were we both don't like what the other person does. When we started dating she said I had to stop smoking...I really didn't want to but hey I liked her so I did, but I said I only would if she stopped drinking. We both agreed and life went on happy. I'd chill with friends who smoke and they'd ask me if I wanna get some and I'd say no cause of my girlfriend. Don't most guys give up something they love to be with someone that they may soon be in love with? I did. Now fast forward a year and a half later, we're chillin and talking and out of no where in the conversation she says she was drinking with her friend. The friend knows me and she knows that I don't like my girlfriend drinking and they do it anyway. So now I told her to stop and tell me everytime she's drank during our relationship. And my girlfriend says like 4 times...now I'm upset cause she broke our deal. She asks why I'm mad cause she didn't even drink that much?(she wasn't even tipsy)her exact words. So I asked her if I told her I smoked but you can't get mad cause I only hit it once, I wasn't even high she said yeah she would be mad. So why can you get mad at me for hypothetically smoking when you actually drank? Then she got quiet cause she realized I was right and there was a moment of silence between us and then I kiss her goodbye and leave. Days pass, we kept talking but not about what needed to be discussed. This happened like four months ago and I'm coming to you guys now for help cause it's kinda getting worse. 

She's stopped drinking but now she keeps telling me how guys will slap her ass in school and other shit...and she's giggling and laughing at these stories while I'm sitting there ready to pop. Again I mention that if I had girls touching me at work she'd get upset. She agreed and said she'd tell the boys to stop...which should've happened when it first started! The straw that broke the camels back for me was when she told me a few days ago one of the guys from before would touch her got in trouble for slapping her ass, while it comforted me that he got in trouble he should've known not to touch her. When she told me she was laughing clearly missing the point that someone touched her again. And after an exchange of word on how can she get away with stuff but if I even bring up doing somethings like she does she'd probably break up with me.

Anyways, fast forward to the other day, we (the three of us) are chilling.  We've all had a little to drink, and she says that she really likes Joe and asked him out (I went off to the bathroom, and this happened as I was coming back and was behind a wall, so that's when I heard it).

Now, I don't think Joe said no because he knows I like her (in fact, I don't think he knows I have a crush on her at all), but essentially he said that he wasn't interested in her in that way, and just wanted to be friends (which I would be lying if I said that didn't make me happy).

She came to my lake house with me and the friend I mentioned earlier a few days later and we talked a lot more and she always seemed to be physically positioned fairly close to me. Whenever I go over to her apartment, she will almost always come make pass-bys and put her arm around me or some type of physical interaction. Often times she'll simply just come sit next to me wherever I am, regardless of who I am talking to. 

We talk a good bit and obviously get along incredibly well, but I do not trust my instincts. She is the first girl I have truly desired since high school (I'm now a sophomore in college), and the last time I thought I had some reciprocation I essentially ate shit and ended up with less than what I started with. 

We are both Greeks at a major state school and she told me she would come to our massive party this Saturday, in which I hope to get the chance to be with her alone and get closer to her without any else's interference. I was just hoping that I could maybe get a little bit of advice, since I've been out of the game a while and I do not trust my instincts. 

Thanks, guys.

She told me he was the only guy she ever dated that she was really freaky with.  He is married too, and she has no desire to be with him, but she obviously enjoyed talking sexy with him.

We spend quite alot of time with each other as she doesn't like being alone which is fine with me! 

As any couple does we have our problems. She has had a few boyfriends (she usually ends up being friends with her exes) but her last boyfriend is the one who creates our conflicts! In our first couple of months he traveled 60 miles to come to her birthday which I thought was odd but she didn't say anything about it. This night he confessed he still liked her and she spent all night talking to him. This upset me but I put this down to me being slightly drunk. 

The second problem was a couple of months after the first, I unintentionally saw her chatting to him on Facebook saying she misses him (I thought she was just being nice as they were friends and they ended their relationship on a good note) but then she says I like you which I just don't know how to handle this so I flip and we talked and talked and she said she was just feeling flustered with deadlines and such. 

Finally, the last problem. My girlfriend got a work placement and it was at the end of term so we decided we would both go home to our families (we live opposite ends of England) We talk everyday, on the phone/text/Skype and everything is going awesome I feel we were a solid couple!

Last Saturday she was going out with her friends as they were all home from university, half way through the night I see that her ex is out with them which makes me really nervous but I trust her. 

She tells me about her night and doesn't mention him being there which I didn't say anything. Skip two days later and I get a message from a good friend who was out on the same night and they over heard my girlfriend saying she thinks she wants to break up with me.

I freak out and ask her she bursts ourt crying which brings me to tears she says she doesn't know how she feels and that she's felt this was for a week, so I am asking why we seemed to be at our best! She then says she wanted to do something with someone else, it doesn't click that she was out with her ex. 

After about 2 hours I and I ask her and she says yes it was about her ex but nothing happened, I told her that I don't want to be with someone that isn't sure about our relationship or thinks about doing stuff with her ex.

Skip 2 days forward I'm a wreck, I'm not eating barely sleeping and being drinking away my sorrows. I realised I knew her Facebook login I know this is an invasion of privacy but I needed to know so I logged on and one of her friends sent her a message say having you told him what happened yet. 

I instantly text her asking if she was 100% honesty, she then rings me saying she did nothing, I tell her about me reading what was said and she burst out crying saying she kissed him. I'm fuming that she lied after me giving her plenty of time to tell me! 

What hurt me most is that she couldn't talk me which lead to some unsavoury events! And that she felt like that for a week and knew I was planning my summer around her! I would have gotten the train down instantly if I knew.

856,2gh6na,"My best friend is a hairdresser and about 6 months ago she got hired at a new salon. She immediately thought her boss (the owner) was hot and felt there was a mutual attraction. He has a girlfriend of 10 years. My friend decided to pursue him regardless of his relationship and they began sleeping together about 2 months into her employment. She always said the only reason she was okay with being the other woman for him was because he promised her he was breaking up with his girlfriend. Promised her they hadn't been intimate in years, and promised her it would all be worth it. They work in a small town and a couple of clients to the salon saw them together at the beach a few times(touching,etc). This made it's way back to the salon and all of her coworkers absolutely hate her since they make it obvious they are in a physical relationship(they flirt at work in front of people too, run off together for hours), deny it when confronted, and his girlfriend comes into the salon often so they all know her pretty well and yet can't really be the ones to tell her.

Her boss (we'll call him T) months later is still living with his girlfriend even though he recently acquired a studio apartment. He tells my best friend we'll call her B, that he isn't ready to move out yet because he wants to make more money, which doesn't really seem to make sense since he already has a new place? He pushes her off of him when they are together in public because he worries about people seeing them, doesn't ever take her out because well.. he lives with his girlfriend and the only time they spend together is when he comes over to her house bright and early in the morning and they just bang before work. B seems to be in total denial that this is all he wants from her. She is convinced it will all be worth it and they will be together but his actions say otherwise to me. She is completely blinded by love and can't seem to realize this is ruining her work relationships and her self esteem. Not to mention, he makes me feel REALLY uncomfortable. Like when I see them together I just think it's so so so gross. The fact she went after a man in a relationship also honestly changed the way I view her as a friend and changed my trust for her. I have no tolerance for people who cheat and I think he is absolutely repulsive. Am I wrong to feel like I can have an opinion about this? Is there any way I can help my friend see who this man really is? Do you think if he wanted to be with her he would have done it by now?

1034,2lwlte,"This is going to be a wall of text so I apologize in advance. My 22 year old brother, Andrew, and his 21 year old fiance, Christy, have been planning their wedding for over a year now. The date is set for April 25th of 2015. Initially, she had asked me to be a bridesmaid, but after she also wanted my daughter to be a flower girl, my husband to be a groomsman, me to do her makeup and engagement photos as a gift to her, and help with details the day of, I felt it was too much on one plate. 

Also, quite frankly, I can't afford her very specific dress (floor length ball gown, which she still has not selected), specific shoes, a tux for my hubby, a flower girl dress for my daughter, high quality makeup in her skin tone, and over $500 in photo sittings and editing. It's just too much time and money that I don't have. I sat her and my brother down and gently let them know that I wouldn't be a bridesmaid, though I was honored she chose me, because I didn't think I'd be a good bridesmaid with so much on my plate. They seemed sad but took it well and, until recently, had no further problems.

Fast forward to this past weekend. They came over for dinner and talked with me and my mom about their wedding plans. I'm just going to sum those ideas up here.

They want to have their ceremony outside. We mentioned that it would almost certainly be freezing. On the same date this past year, it was 30 degrees with a 15 mph icy wind and ice rain later in the day. Christy's response was well I should be warm in my dress, it's pretty heavy. They have a venue that has plenty of indoor area so they can get married there in worst case scenario but they basically have said unless it's snowing or pissing rain, it'll be outside. I'm sure her bridesmaids in their strapless dresses and flip flops or slippers will love that. As for my 1 year old daughter, I'm not forcing her to stay out in cold like that in a tea length dress with no sleeves. I don't know how to politely say, I'm not torturing my daughter or risking her becoming ill because you want a spring wedding in a wintery month.

As for the date, they REFUSE to change it. They've told us that April 20th has no significance, is not an anniversary, and has nothing to do with their relationship. But they will NOT change it, even though we've gently mentioned, hey, May should be much warmer and would definitely make it easier for an outdoor wedding, especially for your guests! Their response is that April 25th is the date, period, and the guests don't matter because it's their day. Okay, fine whatever,  we'll bundle up I guess.

Their plan is to have the ceremony under a gazebo type structure. A very old family friend got some online thing from some vague church so he could marry people. He loves it! We've all known him since we were young, and he offered to officiate my wedding, and wrote a wonderful ceremony for a handfasting for my mom and dad's 25th anniversary/vow renewal, all completely for free. Andrew asked said family friend to officiate and he accepted. Last night we told Christy and Andrew it's getting closer so they need to meet up with the officiant so he can do an interview. They both asked, why?. We explained that the officiant was a close family friend, that's why they asked him to do it, and he likes to get a feel for the both of you and your relationship so he can officiate a beautiful ceremony.

They don't want that. They just want a general do you? Do you? You're now married. Okay, that seems to defeat the purpose of a personal family friend performing it but if that's what they want. Anyway, then we asked what they were going to give the officiant for a gift. They both said nothing. No gift. Why do they need to give him a gift? They're also not paying him as he's doing it for free.

At this point my mom and I are afraid to hear more. But we need to know what's going on. So after the ceremony, their plan is to go to a wedding luncheon. With the wedding party only. That would include his parents, her parents, me and the hubby, her bridesmaids, his groomsmen, and the flower girls/ring bearer. This would exclude the officiant and all the other guests, including her brothers and sisters, as well as my sister and brother. At this point, all other guests would be told to go get lunch, and I quote, wherever and we'll meet back here in a couple hours.

At this wedding luncheon, at a reastaurant in the next town over that's about 20 minutes away, we are all supposed to foot our own bill. Then we drive back and we, as in my family (including the ones not invited to the luncheon), set up the decor and everything else for the reception because Andrew and Christy will be getting ready.

After we get everything taken care of, there will be cake cutting and dancing. And then the end on the wedding. No food, snacks, nibbles, cocktails, nothing like that will be provided during the course of this wedding. Andrew also dropped the bomb that my grandmother, my father's mom, would not be invited because she didn't remember who Christy was at my daughter's first birthday last month. The back story on that? Let's start with the fact that she's 80. Then let's go on to the fact that that she's met Christy once and only once, almost 2 years ago. Lastly, my grandma had 9 kids. Those 9 kids married. They all had a minimum of 4 children. Many of those children are now married and have children. My grandmother has over 65 grandchildren (I don't even know the exact #, I stopped keeping track years ago), about 10 of which have recently or are about to get married. She's 80. She has a hard enough time keeping track of how many people are in her family, nevermind what their names are. It was absolutely nothing personal that she didn't know Christy's name. She just forgot, it has been 2 years for chrissake! So despite her being the only living grandparent we have left, and despite her driving the hour here to make it to Andrews school performances and sending birthday cards every year without fail to her children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren (Andrew included), she's now not to be invited.

I know this is ranty but all this plain, bald faced rudeness is flooring me and I don't know how to handle it. My dad, once we told him his mom wouldn't be invited, was not only hurt but angry. He said he will not go if his mom is not invited. Andrew is insisting on not inviting any of the others from that side of the family, and with such high numbers I can understand, but at least inviting grandma would be polite, not to mention loving.

My sister, my mom, and I put together a wedding planning book for them ages ago and gave it to them. It had tips for a small budget, etiquette, timelines, checklists, and a breakdown of what a basic wedding should have. We got info from multiple sources and spent the time collecting and printing it, but it's completely obvious they haven't looked at it at all. It's like they want this big and beautiful wedding, but they pick out anything that costs them money or means they have to work. Gifts for people who do us favors? NAH. Big princess wedding dress? Check!  Supplying food and refreshment of some kind? Meh, they can go get taco bell or something. Exquisite floor length gowns with exact matching specified cut and color for wedding party? Check!  Paying for said gowns? Nah, too expensive for us, I'm sure everyone else can afford it.

Am I being over the top? Is it just me? Or is this really ridiculous wedding behavior? I've been to maybe 6 weddings in my life, attended in 3, fully planned 1, and have helped plan another. I am all for modern weddings where you throw the whole brides family pays for this, grooms family pays for that out the window, but typically that cost shouldn't rest on your wedding party, guests, and pretty much anyone that isn't you. How do I explain to them the things that won't fly? I'm not freezing my infant because they're stubborn and I'm certainly not going to pay for tux, baby dress, makeup, dinner for me and my hubby, AND play pack mule to set up and take down their entire reception center. I don't care who you are, it's ridiculous and asking too much. Not that they asked if we would set up - they told us we would. I don't want to ruin their day; I want it to go well,  I want everyone to enjoy themselves, but I can't force them to plan better. That's on them.

So my question is how to handle it? Christy is super sensitive and takes literally any criticism as a personal attack so I want to go delicately here. Also, Christy and I work together so achieving peace here is very important.

EDIT: Fixed wedding date to 4/25, not 4/20.

Tl;dr: My brothers wedding plans lack tact and etiquette and is costing my small family a hefty sum. I could handle that if they didn't also expect us to do 100% of the footwork to set up and take down their wedding. They're stepping on toes left and right. How do I tell them they're asking (and telling) way too much?

MINI UPDATE: I sincerely appreciate all if you taking the time to weigh in and offer advice! Just knowing that I'm not the only one thinking this is rude and crazy helps. After talking to my parents and showing them this thread, they decided to talk to Andrew this weekend about a select few things:

- They should put that they're not serving any food or refreshment on the invite so people know they won't be fed, as this isn't typical for a wedding.

- Grandma really should be invited.

- The officiant, since he is and old friend and is doing it for free, needs a gift.

As for me, I'm going to set some boundaries with this wedding, mainly with what I will and won't do and how my daughter will be kept warm during the wedding.

I will post a real update on the convo with my brother after it happens. Thanks again everyone!

25,27u7em,"The situation is basically in the title. I've been working at my company for about 2 years now and really enjoy it and thrive there. My coworker, let's call her Piper (yes I am watching Orange is the New Black), is probably going to be fired sometime this summer. She has been with my company for something like five years, but has jumped around different departments (her choice) so her title is technically entry level.

Another coworker in our group left for a different job, so Piper went to talk to my boss about promotion potential to take his place. My boss gave her a list of things to work on and Piper reacted by basically having a big crying breakdown in my boss's office. Piper is good at the data crunching stuff but doesn't really have a point of view or intellectual curiosity, which is vital for getting to the next level. The past month has basically been a tryout and she's failing.

My boss and I have a great relationship and tells me a lot (probably too much!). She let me know that Piper does not have a future in her position in the company. When the time comes (probably at the end of the summer) she will give her plenty of lead time. Another person who is being let go is getting two months to find a new job so it's probably something like that.

I feel like Piper might have an inkling that she is at the end of the line here but I don't know for sure. I feel weird just coming out and saying it and I don't know if it would cause issue with my boss. When Piper has mentioned seeing interesting jobs online I've encouraged her to apply and have helped her with a cover letter she wrote for one. I feel like if I don't say anything and Piper gets blindsided I'll have betrayed my friend.

**bold**Reddit is interesting, just because we are discussing this problem doesn't necessarily mean everything in our relationship is shit. I almost didn't post here because of all the young posters, but those a little older might be able to attest to the intricacies of relationships as you get older.

We have kids and we are great parents to them. They have everything they want. On the outside we are a picture perfect family. Both work, house in the burbs, minivan in the driveway. We go to Disney and take the kids to nice restaurants.

Because I decided to ask this question about one slice of our lives all of a sudden our relationship sucks.

Relationships are much more than sex, I just need a little help in this arena.

So to answer your question, no, the am fees did not prevent me. I can afford to pay them. The desire to keep my family together prevented me.

I have been reading a lot online about couples and sex after marriage. It is not altogether uncommon ( just not ideal from my perspective) to be experiencing these kinds of problems

I wouldn't even be making this thread if it wasn't for the fact that on the surface it seems like she really wants to hang out with me.

I've been very proud of him :) last night one of his favourite artists was in town and one of his party friends asked him to go. This person smokes and drinks and does coke. My boyfriend used to do those drugs but largely quit. When he does go out (once every two months or so), he seems to fall off the wagon and drink too much, do drugs, and smoke as he smokes when he drinks. It seems like he has an all or nothing mentality when he goes out because he never does it. I don't approve of those choices... how can I encourage him to make better ones? am I even right to be upset that he makes bad choices when he goes partying every once in a blue moon? I don't want to be the nagging girlfriend and I don't want him to think I don't want him to have fun but I feel like it suggests weak willpower and that maybe his friends aren't good influences. How can I communicate my concerns to him? 

Any advice would be appreciated!

One night, I saw he got a text message of smiley face emoticons from a female co-worker of his. This wouldn't strike me as overly weird if he was the type of person to frequently use emoticons, or to like texting in general. After investigating the text history, I noticed one day (during work hours) that he randomly sent her this:

along with links to porn websites he visits.

I took a 5-day family trip last month, and he claims he told her of my absence, and then the fact that he's been having to 'service himself' was brought up. That turned sexual fast. He wasn't clear who brought it up, but it's sketchy from either party IMO (who just says that when someone says their SO is away?). He claims he just has a goofy relationship with her and was being silly/immature and said the conversation ended with her saying she'll 'check out' the websites.

I know he looks at porn regardless of how often he sees me. I have also (earlier on) tried to ask him myself what type of porn he's into only to get a short, vague response. I certainly didn't get any links. I'm not sure if I'm overreacting, or if it is just random banter. However, I know I don't make a habit of discussing these types of things with guy friends, let alone co-workers, and I kind of think it was inappropriate.

We fought often, but had many great times. I can see he apartment window from my dorm window and vice-versa. I broke up with her twice before, each lasted than a day as we were inseperable, and about a week ago for the third time. I was confused and suffering from suicidal thoughts again. I felt terrible as it wasnt my aim to play with emotions but thats what I did. There was talk of getting back together after this one.

561,2uwura,"History first:  
My bf moved in a few months ago, things have been ok between us and we are still getting used to living together. We've been dating for about 10 years though. He is on disability due to PTSD (depression and anxiety as well) so doesn't work and he takes medication and sees a counsellor and also a psychiatrist. I work weekdays 9-6 so I'm gone most of the time while he is usually either at home or at the gym.  
We picked up smoking weed not very long ago. A month maybe? We smoke on weekends and Wednesday nites and he usually gets revved up and I usually get really chill/sleepy. He also seems to get way more stoned than I do and stays stoned sometimes until the next day by smoking the same amount I do. I am not high when I wake up again.  
I also have a sister who I used to live with, and who is diagnosed and receiving treatment for being bipolar. When I lived with her it was a very stressful time for her and I. I still get triggered to get very upset when people do certain things that she used to do. It was hell and it still affects me after about 3 years of not living with her. I have spoken to my bf about this several times and he knows how I feel and he saw me go through it.  
The problem:
Last night we got high and watched The Imitation Game. Good movie, it was very interesting and it blew our minds while high. No big deal, I go to bed at 1 because it is very late and I need to go to work in the morning.  
He stays up and trips out/has a highdea. The idea is a theory about how the human brain works and he wants a statistician to put it in to real math and create AI. He tells me all about it at 1:30 am and I don't think much of it but I am VERY annoyed that he is waking me up and won't stop talking about it. Literally he can't stop talking about it. At 2 am I take 2 gravol and sleep but I am still very upset when I wake up, plus I feel like shit. I go to work.  
When I come home for lunch he apologizes but also brings up the AI idea again! He is serious about this. He went so far as to email the university to ask to meet someone face to face to explain his theory. This is INCREDIBLY out of character. He has no history in math, or science, and his job prior to this was a computer tech. I don't know why he is thinking so seriously about this but I am already upset that he kept me up at night and couldn't respect that I had to work in the morning so I do NOT respond well to him telling me this. I called it crazy and laughed as soon as he said he emailed the university because I thought he did that last night when he was stoned and I was in bed but *he did it today*.  
What the fuck. I am freaking out and crying because I'm thinking he is delusional and going down the same road as my sister did, plus I'm still way overtired and feel sick from lack of sleep. I don't know what to think. I mentioned to him that I thought he was being crazy like my sister which upset him too.  I still think he might be crazy. We are both pissed off - him because I called him crazy and because he *thinks* I just don't understand his theory. I do, I just don't think it is anything more than a stupid highdea. This is just scaring me. I called in sick to work because I am crying so hard. I lied to them though. I have nowhere else to be but be at home (he is gone right now but will be back soon) and I'm so worried and I so do not know what to do. I also have other shit going on this evening that I'm supposed to go to so I'm stressed about that too.  
I don't know what exactly I am looking for, just venting and if anybody has any suggestions for me or can talk to me that would be very helpful.

1181,2oitcw,"This is my first reddit post, but I've lurked here for a while. I hope I'm doing this right.

Am I [26M] overreacting in that my GF [21/F] of 2 years can only achieve orgasm without me participating and while thinking about rape? 

Semi-awkward conversation revealing personal insecurities, self-delusions, fantasies, masturbation methods... let's do this.


I've been feeling useless, disconnected from my gf and dejected about this subject.


The stuff about me: I have a smaller dick than average and I own that. 4 inches is where I am at completely hard.  I also own that in previous relationships, I erroneously found some sort of validation by bringing my partner to orgasm. Hell, it was something I really focused on learning how to do and bringing my partner pleasure was one of the greatest pleasures in sex for me. I used to think that I was good at this since I had good success with previous girlfriends. Not so much lately. Normally I only have sex with people I love and the emotional connection is a big turn-on for me. 


Over the past year I've been trying to read more about techniques, how to read her body better, and how to be a more accommodating lover in general. I'm big into self-improvement and I feel there is a lot I could do better. Basically I've been trying to improve my game, but without much success with my girlfriend. 


My girlfriend has a very interesting way of achieving orgasm and requires what I'm guessing is a certain kind of pressure. The method is that she lays on her front with a fluffy or medium-fluffy blanket between her hands and pubic area and grinds slowly until she orgasms (10-20 minutes). She has been doing this since she was around 9 years old. 


This has been okay, sort of. I've been trying to work around it and incorporate it into our sexy time together, but it feels kind of like a very excluding process. I've tried incorporating toys, but that basically boils down to now wanting a toy to be inside of her while she does the solo blanket grind. I feel difficulty being a part of it at all with her since it requires her total concentration while she face-down grinds her way to orgasms.. that she complains about later being really weak. This is the only way she knows how to get off.

It seems that when she tried to get off while I penetrate her from behind I basically prevent her from orgasming by ruining her concentration. I would love to even be able to hold her hand... something, but she uses both for the process. Her eyes are fixed closed, her face in concentration.  


There has been a number of times where we've been having sex and she'll get on top for a while. Things will be going good, if a bit too fast for me usually but sometimes she'll roll off without a word and facedown grind herself off before falling asleep. I sort of get left hanging, but I feel that since I get off and she doesn't that.. I guess I don't get much of a say in her pleasure. 


 In the meantime, I have no idea what brings that about and I get a sorry later. I feel really disconnected from her when this happens and from feeling unable to help her feel satisfaction, achieve orgasm, or even turn her on.


The other caveat is that she basically has to think about rape between two dudes to orgasm. She told me it varies, but she basically gets off a lot to a scene in a movie where a young boy gets held down and raped by other young boys (about running kites - trying to avoid mentioning too many specific details.) I'm down for fantasies and all, but truthfully I can't get into that with her. It's just the only thing she gets off to.


We've also been having sex less frequently over the 2 years... with a lot of openness and curiosity and exploration in the beginning. Used to be every day... sometimes many times a day.  Now if we have sex once every 3 weeks, I'm surprised. I can't make her feel turned on and I've tried a lot of ways of going about it. 


I figure I could really use some advice. I know there is a lot of get over yourself in threads about feeling inadequate because you can't make your girlfriend get off, but it's really not just that for me. 
As time goes on, I'm becoming less interested in sex. 

I've been feeling less sexual over the past year... almost to the point of a 180. I used to want it all of the time, but the idea of sex doesn't have the same meaning for me anymore. I don't feel involved with her pleasure. A lot of times, I just feel lonely and sad about us. I just... feel sad about sex now and pretty inadequate as a lover. I think this is partly my ego feeling inadequate and part emotional issue. I've started feeling non-sexual as a result of what I'm assuming is my desire to avoid sex and these confusing feelings.


I've tried incorporating toys, vibrators of different sorts and a few other things. We've sexually experimented together a little, but things don't end up being hot for us when we do. The things I was once into, I don't get to participate in much. My favorite thing to do would be to go down on my girlfriends, but she isn't into that either. I feel like I'm giving a lot of effort into this and our pleasure together, but she doesn't seem to care that much about it. I fear I've psyched her out.


This has been really confusing for me and I'm wondering at what point am I supposed to see the reasoning or light here. If I'm being a tool, tell me. If I need to get over myself, well I've been working on that. I've been able to have a reasonably good relationship with her. I love her, sex has been making me feel isolated and lonely when I thought it was about coming together.

The rape thing has lead me to absently wonder if I should encourage her to think about it more often in the hopes of helping her achieve orgasm or work around it another way. It feels kind of mentally awkward to me to approach since I'm hesitant about encouraging those thoughts while we have sex. She says she doesn't.

Are we incompatible? Am I just being a ego-driven tool about it? Thoughts please.

---   
**tl;dr**: Girlfriend grinds a blanket to orgasm and can't have me participate if she's going to succeed. I feel sad and cut off from being a part of her orgasms. Also she fantasizes about kids taking it up the butt to orgasm, which I am hesitant to encourage at all.

I spent 4 years with my ex, Tom. When we met is was truly love at first sight for me, even 4 years in my heart would skip a beat when I saw him. But as often happens to people posting in this sub, it turned out he was cheating on me for over a year (with over 10 different women... What a gent)

Obviously I ended this relationship, and have not seen/contacted Tom since a few weeks after the breakup. It was messy - I ended up changing my number and emails so he'd stop contacting me, and I even moved country to accept a job offer I had been deliberating. Tom was going to move with me, until I found out his infidelity.

This was all a year and 6 months ago, and I'm happily settled in new country - love my job and in general very happy here. 8 months ago I met a guy through friends at work, and 6 months ago we became an official couple. This new guy, Luke, is probably the sweetest, kindest and most loving guy I have ever had the pleasure of knowing. Honestly everyone who meets him loves him, including my family (who never liked ex Tom).

My problem is... that even all this time later, no matter how in love I feel with Luke, I can't get Tom off my mind. He was such an ass to me so I should be so happy now with someone who treats me like a princess, but Tom's always on the back of my mind. I would never, ever be with him again and can truly see myself with Luke forever, he's perfect.

It's just not the same as it was with Tom though. I don't feel the fiery love as with Tom, don't feel the same electricity. It was not an intense love at first sight but a comfortable mature development. But I think this might be because I'm older, not experiencing first puppy love etc?

Has anyone else been through this or can anyone offer advice?

I don't want to sound like I don't love Luke - I do with all my heart

171,1u1v9x,"So I started talking to her over the summer, and at the time she was seeing a guy. After a couple months, she dumps him and starts seeing me the next day. Things were initially great; we bonded on everything, and had absolutely perfect chemistry. Everything was just a dream. We couldn't get enough of seeing each other, but eventually she wanted distance and that was fine (more on this later.) So I tried hanging out with her less, thinking that's what she meant.


Looks like I was wrong. The flirting started to slow down, and when I wasn't able to sleep with her out of nervousness--I kinda put a lot of pressure on myself by trying to impress her with fancy dates and stuff--things got a little more serious than intended. I didn't even mean to impress her with these kinds of things; I genuinely wanted to do nice things for her. But anyway, more distance was required, and I thought I obliged. But when I saw her really pulling back, I started getting nervous and eventually she said she's confused on her emotions, because sometimes she thought of her ex, but other times she wanted to run into my arms. 


Then the text. Before she and I started seeing each other, I had to get permission from her BFF, a gay guy who she knew for years. When things got awkward with her, I decided to ask him for advice because hey, he knew her well and he considered me a friend. He declined the advice (although he had helped in the past,) and my SO stumbled upon the texts. She accused me of trying to take advantage of his fondness for me, her accusing me of being insecure which She saw when we first started seeing each other and the eventual split.


This is where I bring up distance again, because her comments of insecurity through me for a loop. I knew I fucked up when I couldn't sleep with her, but we both decided to take it slow and I was content with that. Did my affectionate demeanor in person/text count as smothering though? I'd send little flirty things like Just wanted to say you're beautiful, and I always tried to include her in what I did. Hell, she signed up at my gym and started doing yoga with me. Again, everything synced. But I'm still really confused because I'm pretty outgoing, and I wouldn't harass her to do things with me--I'd just extend the invite. We also saw each other 2-3 times a week. So if anyone can offer some insight as to where I was insecure, please...I wanna fix this if I can. It was too perfect.

Relevant - I have tried for the past year to be a stay at home mom. Not just by saying, Hey, honey. Go earn money while I enjoy the fruits of your labor. I've been doing daycare - really hard to make a living at in our state, as it requires that every daycare operator with more than one family have a license, and getting licensed takes a lot of money, which we hadn't saved up for. Also the new house we bought last year has a yard which is only fenced on three sides, and this is not up to daycare standard, so we would also have to pay to have yard refenced, and if we can't afford our bills now, obviously we can't afford to fence yard. I have a B.A. in English Lit and have worked as a journalist and a long-term substitute teacher, mostly, so in an effort to both finally be there for my family (my mom was a stay-at-home mom, and I/we hope to have more kids. I think I had hoped for this sooner than him, though I think it's mostly a case of wanting to be more financially stable, which I agree with, but also fear that I will get too old, and we will miss the chance). 

So, in an effort to garner income, I have tried Etsy (love to cook, crap at crafts, but I have not successfully mastered pricing, and fear my goodies will spoil in the mail after I ship them across the country), Avon (no one buys Avon), InstaEdu (you can literally sit at your computer for hours waiting for a student, and then many of them just want you to write their paper for them, which I am not allowed to do), Fiverr (some weeks I made as much as $70 for about a day's worth of proofreading), and Uber (by the time I drive an hour to get to an Uber city near us, I need to work 8 hours for it to be profitable. After Uber takes their cut, it works out to about minimum wage minus the wear on our car). 

Obviously, I am not cut out to be an entrepreneur. I need to go back to work. He wants me to get a job someplace like the hospital where I work long days for a lot of money. And we need the money. Also, it is so nice to see him happy that I will probably do that. I just want to find a job that is satisfying if I am going to go back to work, but if I mention the schools, or working at the paper, or working for a nonprofit, he says, Why do you sell yourself short? I don't think he considers anything having to do with the humanities a real job, and as someone who has built her life on the humanities, I feel like consequently he doesn't value me. When we met, I was working in a school reading program, and he seemed proud of me when he told others about it. I never got this feeling until now. 

Also relevant, I have a daughter whom he is in the process of adopting. She was eight when we first got together, and is 11 now. She has type 1 diabetes, draws/makes tons of crafts in almost all of her free time. Lately, she is hard to relate to sometimes. She's a great, smart, kid. But she can put off a chore forever, and when she is getting a parental lecture, is apt to come out with something unhelpful like, I have strong opinions.

When I get up in the morning, I pack his lunch first thing. I try to do chores throughout the day. Often, I have a toddler with me. If I weed, for instance, the toddler wants to sit on my lap. On days when I don't have the toddler, I do try to do a lot of housework. Our house is still messy, some places more than others. But if there is housework that gets done, generally I am the one doing it. He criticizes EVERYTHING. I like to do dishes with a washcloth, and he likes to do them with a scrub brush. I think this is not a big deal, but he acts disgusted. Personally, I feel like a scrub brush is unsanitary, as you don't change it every time, but that's really neither here nor there. I can accept that different people do things differently. Last time I accidentally brought home Mountain Dew instead of his preferred Diet Mountain Dew, he said, You always get things wrong. 

Every time he wants to do something differently, he says, Everybody I've ever grown up with, everyone I've ever lived with, did it x way. For instance, it came to light last night that 'everyone' puts bathroom cleaning products in the bathroom. I put them under the kitchen sink, with all the other cleaning products, because there is a childproof lock on that cabinet door, and the bathroom cabinet can't be as easily childproofed, so consequently contains nothing unsafe. If I say that I wish we could not have an extra wardrobe of polo shirts in the bedroom (I've accepted it now, but as an example), he says, Fine, I'll just put all my things downstairs and sleep there. If I say I'd like a bookcase in the office, he'd like to tell me where it should go (next to the closet in front of the door, so it doesn't shut??), gripes because we have too many books, and he doesn't like that they aren't organized categorically. I feel like I am running a household, but if I try to have a say in how it is run, he is unhappy, and so I am unhappy. I think we both usually just give up, and I'm so frustrated, because it's just a wardrobe or a bookcase. In the end, these are trivial things that don't matter. On the other hand, he's always saying how people used to tell him he was organized, and people tell me I am good at organizing things too. I would like some credit for also being a person who knows how to organize stuff. I don't want to be the person who feels responsible if there is dog hair everywhere, or laundry or dishes undone. He gripes about these things, but doesn't help out with them himself very much, and when he does, he gripes about my system, so I'd rather do them myself. I don't know what to do. I go back and forth between trying really hard to do everything perfectly so he'll be pleased, and saying, Screw it, no one else but me does this chore, and I am not in the mood right now. 

I don't feel like I was raised by savages because I don't starch my shirts. When he is discussing this, the 'slipped standards', he says, We just come from very different backgrounds. His was a military family, and I think his mom ran a pretty tight ship. I had two families - my mom and stepdad, a biker married to Mrs. Cleaver (from Leave it to Beaver), basically - they smoked pot, but as a very structured 'adult time' in the den, where kids weren't allowed, and the house was VERY clean. I still look up to my mom. - And my dad, an SCA/gamer type. My dad's house was a bit lax, but I am sure my mom's house was every bit as clean and rule filled as my husband's. I resent it that he appears to think I was raised by wolves/hippies. At the very least, I was raised by clean, conscientious hippies. They voted Republican and read Mother Earth News. 

Anyway, I don't know what I want. Validation. To figure out why he thinks our life sucks and fix it. Lots of things about our relationship are so good. Most of them. We have so much fun together, playing video games, and watching movies, and hanging out reading Reddit, and doing cool stuff around town - going to our favorite crepe place or for a drive with our daughter. I admire the way he tries so hard, always, to live up to a high standard he sets for himself. He works really hard, and he tries really hard to make sure that our daughter grows up to be a good, responsible person too. He's very loving, and always wants to save me the best piece, or the fluffiest towel, or bring home the chocolate I like. He makes me happy. How can I do the same? What am I doing wrong, or is it just not about me at all, and if so, what can I do to support him?

I've tried to comfort her and reassure her that I don't think it's personal however I'm wary because;
a few months ago I felt very left out of stuff and I registered this feeling with the group, some were apologetic and explained there had been confusion (including the person who is now upset) and some who where a little more stand offish, though did explain. However in the process of this I found out how some people had been very critical of how much drama this had brought to the group, and felt that I had been given false information that made another party look bad, information which I didn't really notice at the time. I apologised for any part in the drama and felt everything was okay.
However, now there is a similar situation arising again! I feel stuck between comforting my friend and reassuring her it was probably accidental, and completely staying out of and thus not creating drama. I personally do not feel that my actions are creating drama, and that ignoring the friend would be very rude however I can see other members of the friendship group seeing what I have done as bitchy or unnesscarily involved, given what happened before. The friend has also asked me not to tell the others about her grievances, which makes me uncomfortable as that does feel bitchy.

Should I; comfort the friend and reassure her, or simply ignore the reach out, or speak to another friend? I sort of want to stand my ground and comfort the friend, but that has the chance of losing some really long standing friendships.

1225,1m1xaz,"It isn't that complicated but I am trying to be detailed. I have many hobbies and like to keep myself busy. I am smart, great job, very fit, and I like to think I am a beautiful woman (you are welcome to ping me for a picture if you suspect that is the source of my problem). However I have been single for a while and friends say I just need to make time in my life for dating. So I do that and sign up on one of those popular online dating sites. I got a ton of messages immediately but men seemed to take forever to take it offline. When they did try to set a date it was for a week or more out. At first I would tell them ask me next week then and we will make plans. But then they would ping me in a week trying to set the date out even further. Even after a first date they would try and schedule a second more than a week out and after hardly hearing from them between dates I would just lose interest. I don't see how anyone can get to know someone enough to start building a relationship with that much time passing. And friends say don't keep all your eggs in one basket but the last way I want to spend my time is dating a bunch of people at once. It is so exhausting. I love my free time and I need it for my hobbies. I don't want to spend it in bars more than a few nights a week.

So I was told I just need to be more patient. Fair enough. I chatted with one guy a for a few weeks. First date was set 2 weeks out after 2 weeks of messages and then I hear nothing from him. 1st date went wonderful. He is handsome, fun, smart. Same hobbies. I sent him an email telling him I had fun the following day. Then nothing for 4 days. He texts asking for a 2nd date....8 days out. Friends keep saying I need to make time and be more patient so I did that. I got nervous that he forgot about me after not hearing from him for 6 days so I sent a text to test the waters. I heard back from him quickly. After that I saw him at the 2nd date. Pretty much the same thing for the 3rd. For the 4th date he cut it short to go to a BBQ. I understand, we are still just in the dating phase. I don't deserve an invite, not to mention it would be rude to bring someone else when there might not be enough food. But I will admit, I was disappointed by the short one hour date in the middle of a beautiful Saturday. I even started to feel like it was some sort of pity date.  We discussed getting together during the week and I made sure my week was clear. You know, making time. He said any night but Monday worked for him. I offered to make him dinner Tuesday or Wednesday (which would mean skipping either climbing with a friend or a fitness class but I wanted to make time because I liked him and felt it was worth it to get to know him) and he pretty much responded with Friday looks best, see you then! I asked about Wednesday again which felt like begging but he has to go to a BBQ all of a sudden. I know, I don't deserve an invite. 

I know it is just 6 days (5 now) but I don't want to wait 6 days for a guy who I don't feel is getting to know me. I would rather just cancel and head out to my cabin Friday so I can spend a Friday night, full Saturday, and most of Sunday there enjoying the sun and stars and nursing my rejected heart (at least it looks like rejection to me). It is already a 6 hour drive to get there. I already was leaning towards heading out there but I was expecting him to pick a day Tues-Thur. Not Friday.  I don't want to miss a clear night for what I expect to be just a beer before he has to dart off to something else or whatever. I doubt I will hear from him between now and then and I feel like I am just preparing myself to pretty much check out with this guy. The idea of even doing anything physical with him is starting to sound like some sort of chore. I really did like him. I have told him I liked him. He clearly isn't interested or just keeping me on the hook, right?

I feel like it looks like I am some sort of crazy to try and talk to him about the lack of attention or whatever. I honestly don't think he is clueless, here. I do like him and I keep hearing He is just taking it slow and you need to be more patient. Don't go to your cabin and make room for him. But I don't think he is making any effort to even get to know me. And I don't want to invite him out to the cabin. We haven't even had sex yet, just a bit of making out, so it would be awkward and truthfully I will be hurt when he turns it down anyway. And I am worried that I am just going to resent him Friday if I see him. If this pace is actually normal starting all over pretty much means I won't have any couples costume for Halloween. But I don't think it is normal. I would think that if he liked me back he would be making time for me and making an effort to get to know me. Like reaching out every few days. Not every 6-8ish. Is my gut right or my friends? Should I just cancel Friday and head out to my cabin and pretty much accept this guy isn't interested or am I just not being patient enough?

TL;DR Men are putting a lot of time between contact and dates. Friends say I am not being patient. I am starting to build resentment from moving my life around for guys I like. I don't believe they are returning the favor. And I hate dating.

UPDATE: If anyone is still looking or paying attention. I didn't think it was a big enough deal to make a whole new string but if anyone cares here is where I am at: I did hear back from Mr. Aloof. He seemed bummed that I was canceling and wouldn't be in town for the weekend and he let me know all of next week is open. But he also told me this week was open and I made it clear there is no way I am falling for that one again. I said he is welcome to reach out and if I am not busy we can try and pick up where we left off. But I will not make plans for 10 days out. I don't want this to be a pattern. It is unacceptable to me. This is not a good sign if we are only dating. But if we ever did do something again I would pretty much view that as a first date. I made it clear I don't feel connected to him and he has only made it difficult to build that kind of trust. I also made it clear that I am hesitant to keep any of my week open since this week it clearly backfired on me. He sounded sad and said he will call me soon but I honestly don't think I will hear from him again and I can care less. I did log in (45 new messages holy cow) and I have been updating my profile as well as chatting with an exciting new guy who I am very excited to meet on Wednesday (2 days, not 2 weeks - good sign, yes?)!! I did check and Mr. Aloof has not actually checked in for about a week. Doesn't mean it is okay to keep so much time between contact. I guess it was just a bad time for him to start dating.

902,36jqbg,"A couple of months ago my boyfriend told me that while he had been at a conference that an old friend he used to hook up with, messaged him asking to hang out. He declined due to the schedule of the conference. Then he added something that changed everything - he told me that she had told him before he asked her out to drinks that she had said Well why you're in town, why don't we hook up for old time's sake?. She did not know at this time that my boyfriend and I were dating.

After he told me that, I expressed that that was worrisome. He laughed it off like it was a joke. I told him that it made me uncomfortable, and he said not to worry - they were just friends.

Fast forward to this week. He again went to that city for another conference. One night he didn't text me between 5PM and 10AM the next morning, when he was supposed to give me a call that night at 10PM. The whole night I was worried sick that he was hanging out with her, and low and behold he was.

He messaged me around 2AM on Facebook apologizing for not calling me. His message made it evident that he was pretty intoxicated. He was at the conference with a specific group that had had the whole weekend planned so I found that bizarre and asked why the conference itinerary had changed. He told me it hadn't, that he went to a party. I asked if this FWB was there, and he said yes, that he had asked her what she was up to that night and she invited him to this party.

I am/was livid. I have never felt so betrayed in my life. I told him that her saying that she still wanted to have sex with him should have been an indication that he should stay away. He told me that I was juvenile for saying that you can't be friends with someone you used to bang - I agreed with that point, that it is possible.. but she had said this only two months ago, so obviously there was still some sexual attraction there.

When I was at his house speaking to him about this, he was emotionless and cold while I was bawling. I told him that I felt like he disrespected me and our relationship. He insisted that he did absolutely nothing wrong. I asked if he knew if this would make me upset when he made the choice to see her, and he said he thought it might. I asked why he would do that then, knowing the consequences, and his reply was Because she is a good friend of mine. They talk maybe once every three months. He told me that I was being ridiculous, and that although they were drunk together, he said that he wouldn't shut up about me to her and said that he was gushing to her about how he had finally fell in love with someone.

In a moment of anger, I said So why do you still talk to her? Does knowing that she would still bang you if she could boost your ego? Is it the attention you crave?. Right after I said that he asked me where I was staying that night, because it certainly wasn't at his place and he proceeded to try to kick me out.

Part of me feels like I'm overreacting, but part of me makes me feel like that is just him manipulating me in an attempt to make me feel that way. I would never hang out with my ex-boyfriend without 1) asking current boyfriend if it was okay and 2) in a risky setting such as getting drunk alone together (he didn't know anyone else at the party).

I told him I knew most of her history with men, and that I didn't blame her or judge her for any of it. He was reluctant to continue his story, but, being the aspiring journalist that I am, I pressed him to tell me.     

He then proceeded to tell me about an incident she had when she first moved to town: She had worked at a small company that was owned by a husband and wife and ended up sleeping with the husband, who was much older than her (somewhere around 35-36 at the time, and she was 22).

For a variety of reasons, I made it clear to anyone that I met or even messaged with that I wasn't looking for a serious relationship right now, but I'd like to find friendship, casual dating, and fun. So, I tried to establish that idea up front, that I wasn't wanting to get serious. I expected that it might drive some women away, but it was what I felt like I had to offer. 

Well, it turns out that I did ok for myself. I managed to connect with a few people for a date here and there. It felt good and very reinforcing to my ego to know that I wasn't the guy that my wife had made me feel like for years. Along the way, I started seeing Christy. We'd established a pretty regular thing, enjoyed being together, had great sex, and mutually agreed to retain the ability to see other people. Several months later, a similar situation developed with Patricia. For a couple of months, this was working out pretty great. We were all busy people and if I was free and Christy was busy, I'd give Patricia a call and vice versa. As far as I knew, either of them was doing the same thing. Fun, casual dating was all it was supposed to be.

A couple of months further on and, more or less simultaneously, Christy and Patricia separately had the talk with me... Again, very flattering and buoying to my ego... telling that I'm a great guy, the best sex they have ever had, they think about me all of the time... AND they want to become exclusive with me. I felt kind of trapped as both of them admitted that they had already kind of gone exclusive with me without really telling me as much. I was (and am) kind of cowardly here and I'm not proud of it, but I didn't tell either of them right then that I was seeing another person already. 

Now I feel like I am cheating on both of them and I don't know what to do. They are both great people and don't deserve this kind of treatment and disappointment. I know that this can't go on indefinitely. A selfish part of me is enjoying all of the sex and attention that I'm getting and is slow to give up on this good thing. Another part of me is worried that I'm still in the rebound from my divorce (a good part of why I didn't want to get into serious dating right away). 

What is the best, safest, sanest way to deal with this? Break it off with both of them and try to do better next time? Sit down with each of them and come clean and take whatever comes? Sit down with both of them and let them fight it out and hope for the elusive threesome? Kidding, kidding... sort of. ;)

My family is quite pious, and I myself was until I began drifting from faith for the last two years. The rampant political chants and economical ties of megachurches in my country were too much. Besides, I simply do not share the same conviction of the existence of a deity my parents hold. But I never talked to them about my doubts because I know religion constitutes much of their lives and it means so much more to them than I could ever imagine. 


Nevertheless I spilled the beans. Out of pure impulse and emotion. And maybe lethargy. My mother wanted to read out loud a couple books of the New Testament together for the week. I could have just simply read the Bible with her. There is much to learn from it. On the other hand, however, I felt like it should be my choice to read the Bible, not be coerced to read it. (Mind you, my parents never 'forced' me to read the Bible but my mother would change her tone if I said no one time too much). 


I looked at her and said no, somewhat like Bartleby's 'I would prefer not to'. She did not like my tone. She found it condescending, telling me to get off my high horse. She asked me why I would go to church even though I do not respect and worship God. I said I go there because if I stop going, how are you going to explain that to the community? 


A very poor choice of words. Soon after, my father joined. He asked me what my other conviction is that makes me distance from the church, what life goals I have, how I am going to achieve them by myself, and how it was God who helped with everything we lacked, including my tuition. He asked me how I was going to put through the rest of my university years. 


My mother won't talk to me, my father is visibly upset, lost, even furious at some point. 


There is time and place for such conversation. I don't know why I even started this. So that I can avoid reading excerpts from a very thick book?

203,34tjfo,"First, some context. Beth* has been my coworker for ~3 years and during this time we have developed a good friendship. I wouldn't by any means call her my best friend but she's close to my heart. She and her husband Joe* have been married for about 5 years now and we have often hung out together. Just to be clear I am not friends with Joe; he simply is the husband of my good friend.

Beth talks about Joe like he is the light of her life. Even though they both work full time jobs she makes sure to get home before him so she can make dinner and they can sit down and have a family meal. She prioritizes their relationships and has had to cancel plans with me in the past to take care of him when he's sick, to visit his family, etc. Beth is all about Joe. 

About 2 months ago I went to a local bar with another friend of mine. We sat down at the bar and just a few stools away was Joe with a strange woman who I hadn't seen before. At first I wasn't too worried but they seemed to be getting very cozy with one another. As we got up to leave Joe noticed us and we made eye contact. I didn't say anything and just left the bar. 

A week or so later Beth, Joe, and I had dinner together and while his wife was in the bathroom he explained that the woman I saw him with was an intern at his company and they were celebrating a job well done. He claims they had been part of a group but the others had left earlier and they were the only two left. I told him that as long as Beth knew about it I didn't mind plus it was none of my business anyway what he did on his free time. 

Fast forward to a week ago. I was browsing Tinder at home when I ran across a picture of Joe along with an active profile. I was shocked. I scrolled through the pictures and confirmed that it was him. He was even using a picture taken ON HIS HONEYMOON. I swiped left (of course) but took a screencap of his profile just in case. 

People of Reddit, I don't know what to do. On the one hand, I realize that it takes two to tango and if Joe is unhappy is may not be his fault. I don't obviously know what's going on in the confines of their marriage. On the other they are talking about buying a house and having children. Personally I would want to know if my SO had an active Tinder profile and was seen out at bars with a strange woman. I have been sitting on this information for a week now because I am afraid to possibly be the one to break up their marriage.

911,2h6nke,"I met my boyfriend when I got to college and we have been pretty much inseparable since. We spend all our free time together and have a really great, supportive, comfortable, happy relationship.

It is my first real relationship, but his second. He was wronged by his first girlfriend (was cheated on) and has pretty low self esteem from that incident and from general lack of self confidence. He has spoken about it before, but it never seemed to affect our relationship.

However, when we were away from each other for summer holiday, the problems stemming from his past arose. He started to get very distrustful, and when I would go out drinking in my hometown, he would get very upset and accuse me of cheating. He seemed like a different person in those times. He would be really angry (something I never experienced from him before) to the point of tears sometimes, and not want to talk to me, but needed reassurance to feel better. It was hard. I didn't want to reassure someone who was being so hostile and aggressive, but I also love him very much and wanted to help him with his uneasy feelings.


It became a cycle. Every time I would go out, he would get angry, I would beg him to stop, and to trust me and remind him of our soft and comfortable love, and then he would finally come to his senses and apologize and promise to never do that again. But it kept happening.

Now that we are back at school, I thought the mistrust would stop. Last year (before the summer) when I'd go out, it was 100% fine. But now that we have gotten into the pattern of him getting angry and distrustful when I drink, it is happening now at school. He gets very upset when I go out, and wants me to leave my friends early and to spend time with him and his friends or just him. Just like in the summer time, I don't really want to go out because I don't want to upset him. 

He apologizes genuinely when all the fighting dies down. When I tell him everything I am telling you guys, he understands my side completely and knows he's messing up. The more he gets close to me and the more he invests, the more his insecurities are eating at him. He says it's not fair to me and he loves me so much, and knows I would never do anything to him. But that his anger takes control and he cant help but get angry. He doesn't want to, but doesn't know how to stop. He knows I'm not his ex girlfriend, but he can't seem to let go of that insecurity that she caused.

I love him so so much, but I know that it is not okay for me to be on the receiving end of this. I gave him some sort of ultimatum recently, saying that if he does this again, I'm going to need space (indefinitely). I know that giving ultimatums are the wrong thing to do. But, I don't know how to deal with this. Other than this, everything about our relationship is going smoothly. What do I do to help him get over his insecurity? Can I help him, or is this something that he needs to deal with himself? Also, if he does do it again and I break it off for awhile, am I selfish for not sticking with him through his self-battle?

My grandma does not have the daughter's phone number and was communicating to her via the neighbor.

571,2i2570,"So the title might be a bit misleading, but here’s the story: We’re both in college – I’m a senior and she’s a sophomore.  When we started dating last year I wasn’t really keeping track of my spending – we went out to dinner a lot and I would buy us coffee etc., so we were living pretty comfortably as college students.  I was able to do this because my college is paid for and I took a year off school to work, so I have a little extra saved up, and she knows it.  On the flip side, she has almost no money saved up from work and her parents are paying for most of her rent etc..  However, after regretting my spending habits from last year, I started this school year with the plan to stay on a strict budget which means no more going out to eat.  I made this clear to her at the beginning of the year and she seemed to understand.  

I frankly don't think that I should be obligated to pay for anything of hers.  I worked hard for what I have and to put myself in a position to have a comfortable living arrangement in college.  

However, there have been a few occasions that have really gotten on my nerves and I was hoping that someone could help me out in dealing with it.  

First, about half the times that we get coffee, she’ll seem to be thinking about what to order and says “you go first” so when I get to the cash register, she pops up behind me and says “ok I’m ready” then goes ahead and tells the barista her drink order – putting our orders on the same tab that I’m forced to pay.  It’s hard to speak up in the situation because I feel like I’ll look like a complete asshole, and a few times after this has happened she has witness my expression and asked if I would like the money back – which I decline because again, it would make me feel like an asshole if I accepted.  It sounds like such a small thing to be complaining about, but I’ve worked really hard for what I have and I don’t want to feel like I’m supporting someone else, lately the relationship has felt less like a relationship and more like I’m just one of her parents feeding her money.  

On a few other occasions – we planned a trip to go to Disneyland last summer – I planned out all the details trying to get us the best prices on everything, and when I came to her talking about how we would split it up she acted completely confused like I was supposed to be paying for the entire trip – we ended up not going because she didn’t want to pay for her half.   

What sparked me to write this was because I ate her Indian food, which was in my fridge, which she told me that she didn’t like, and when she found out I had ate it she says very seriously “you owe me that back”. Like what the fuck.

Its been about four years since I've felt in control of my life.  They mostly stem from self esteem issues, and dealing with my ADD.  And while they have never been all that serious, they still affect me on a day to day basis.

My girlfriend is someone I've had feelings for for a while.  I've known her since my senior year of high school, when she was just a freshman, but at the time, being with her didn't seem feasible because she was so young, and I already had a girlfriend.  She had a boyfriend for a while, and her relationship with him wasn't the healthiest.  She relied a TON on him emotionally, was convinced she would marry him, even though they were way too young to be thinking about something like that.  When they broke up, it hurt her a lot, and she started to look for ways to rely more on herself for happiness and emotional stability, rather than another person.

About two months ago, I told her how I feel about her.  She tells me she likes me, but that she's just gained all of this confidence and love for herself and she's afraid that she'll lose it and become reliant on me like her last boyfriend.  I tell her I understand so we kind of just start having this weird relationship.  It was like friends with benefits, but it was more than that.  We didn't see other people, and everyone around us knew how we felt about each other.  

There was a night where we were hanging out, and she told me about how she had been asked on dates by other guys, but she basically told them no because of this thing she had going on with me.  After hearing that, I basically told her that we were already together and that at this point it was just about whether or not we were gonna call it that.  After talking about it, she eventually agreed, but told me she wasn't thinking about taking this relationship too far emotionally, and I said that was fine.  It needed to happen naturally if it was going to happen at all.

Through all this I've tried to not make things too hard on her regarding my current situation.  Im a senior in college, have never worked because I wasn't sure I could focus on a job and school at the same time, and don't have a license because of my phobia and anxiety with driving.  I know it sucks for her, and it sucks for me too. At this point in my life, I should have these things figured out already.

That being said, all of my issues with working and school and driving stem from my lack of self confidence, my anxiety and depression, and I can't help but feel inadequate with her.  Its become a kind of vicious cycle.  I know I have to solve these problems myself, and that I have to be able to like myself before this relationship can really develop.  I feel like she's already gone through this kind of self-development (she's been depressed in the past) and that like almost everything else in my life, I'm lagging behind.  I want to be able to talk to her about this without her feeling like I'm trying to make it her problem.  I want to look/and feel in control when I don't really feel like I am.  Basically, I want to be the boyfriend she deserves but I know I'm not there right now, and its been really tough trying to get myself there.

When we first got together it was the same night she broke things off with her EX, we were friends before this but I have had a thing for her since we met.  
  
We were together for 4 months and we had a fallout about her still talking to her EX, which I didn't mind at first but it became more and more frequent. She ended up leaving me a couple of days later for him as he had managed to manipulate his way back in using out fight as a base.  
  
I knew this wouldn't last long and chalked it up to her not getting closure with him. I was obviously annoyed and upset about what had happened but i still had contact with her as we had bought a car together and I wanted use of it until she bought me out.  
  
Within 5 days she had seen what a mistake she had made when she came to collect the car keys from me and I invited her in for a cup of tea. She received a very angry call from him for being with me and when he came to pick her up proceeded to make her cry about it.

she calls me once a week around the same time, but not this week, but i think she's expecting me to call her often...

we see each other once in every... week and a half, i'd rather see her more, i mean she seems to be fine with every 10 days or thereabouts...

honestly it's like i'm analysing her, and looking for something to make myself think that she really couldn't give a shit if we were to get together or not. i think that's tied in with some small insecurities i have - i have a badit habit of doubting myself :/

Background: My ex (30M) and I (30F) broke up about 5 months ago. We lived together and had a very close relationship. We had a lot of fun, our sex life was still good, and really felt like we were going to make it. We had problems we couldn't solve as a couple which led to our demise. Nothing too big just lack of communication. We broke up amicably and mutually but it was still pretty hard I am still not completely over him.

He reached out about 3 weeks ago and told me he wanted to hang-out as friends. We've hung out a couple of times and he hasn't tried anything but when we're together gives me his full attention and I can still feel a spark-that may only be on my part though. He did tell me we had very good memories together so he wants us to be a part of each others lives. 

My questions is,in your opinion, what are the odds that he actually just wants to be friends? Is this something men want so soon out of a relationship? 
Thank you!

At the beginning he was amazing, my self esteem grew and I felt like I was on top of the world. For once reddit, I felt as if I was normal. He made me fall for him hard. Deliriously in love. January this year was when that all started to change. I found out about another woman he had being seeing for 1.5 years. I was going to propose to him a week later. Is not that he was having sex with her that hurt really stung, it was that he was telling her that he loved her too. I made her aware of the situation, he chose me straight away. He just liked that someone else liked him. I decided to stay with him, to try and make it work, I loved him with every part of me. Things started getting better, but there would be crazy fights as well. He would do something that would remind me of what he did before and I would get really sad. Then he would start screaming at me for being sad and hurt. He makes me believe it's all my fault. It has gotten physical. I have an extremely bad back after an accident, I had surgery last November and am possibly facing more. Knowing how much pain I am always in, one time he shoved me to the ground and was pushing me on the site of my surgery. I was screaming in pain and he kept going. I forgave him. He has bruised my arms, cut my eye. I forgave him. Two Fridays ago he hurt me again, I withdrew and a few tears ruled out. He ripped the covers off me, shoved me out of his house, down his stairs and down the drive way. The whole time I was screaming, my back, my back. I fell on the drive way, I couldn't feel my leg. It was minus 2 deg Celsius outside. He was leaning over me, calling me a bitch, a cunt, telling me I'm worthless. I was crying, begging him to get away from me, screaming for help but none of the neighbors came. He went and got a broken piece of glass and started crying his arm on top of me, letting his blood fall on me. I screamed for help more and pleaded for him to stop. He put his hand around my throat and I spluttered. It was then that he realised what he was doing. He stood over me just watching me cry for what felt like forever. Eventually he came back down to my level and told me loves me and tried to help me. I still couldn't feel my leg, but eventually the 
feeling came back. I struggled home. He called me the next morning even after I begged him not to contact me again. I met up with him at night, I told him in a public area that I wanted to forget the last few years ever existed. He left, but then I went to his home. I forgave him again. It's now a week later Monday morning, he's gone to work and I'm laying in his bed scared and crying. I know I have to leave because this is the man who is going to kill me. My self esteem is lower than it has ever been. I can't stop thinking about suicide. Why do I keep coming back for more, what's wrong with me?

All of our emails are up on the class webpage, so one guy in our class sent out a mass email to everyone saying that if they needed any help they could ask him, ect. I replied (being nice) saying thanks, and nice to meet you. 

Since then, he has found out who I am (not difficult with only two girls in the class), and has been sitting next to me every time, asking for my help, striking up conversations while I'm trying to pay attention, and just being over-friendly in general. He has since then been emailing me, telling me how pretty and nice I looked during class and things of that sort. He tells me how smart I am constantly. I do not reply to these emails, maybe one in five if he is asking a question on the homework but other than that I do not reply to the other compliments.

I want to be civil, but this is inappropriate behavior for such an older man. I have to see him in my class for the next few months, so I don't really know how to approach this. I'm not even entirely sure he knows I'm in high school. I have told him I'm only taking this one class, but I don't really know how to casually slip it into conversation and be like oh yeah, I'm 16 by the way. 

I'm very antisocial and introverted, so I did not expect to make friends. I am a generally helpful and friendly person, but I did not announce that I'm 16 when I went into the class, because I didn't believe anyone would actually try something like this.

I do have a boyfriend, and I'm wondering if I should just tell him I have one and that he's coming on too strong as well.

338,2hrvlb,"A little background story, I tried to keep it short, but I also needed to get it all out, sorry. 

We met at a conference and hit it off, we live quite far away from each other, but we stayed in touch and started talking daily about everything. We become really good friends, I was coming out of a bad long term relationship and she is dealing with anxiety and depression so us talking together really brought us close. Then she confessed having feelings for me, I was honestly starting to develop feelings for her too, but because this would be a long distance relationship (although we do visit each other), I wanted to take things slow. She agreed, but went forward quite fast and I could not respond back in the same way because I was not ready. A short while after she attended a speed dating event and I assumed it was because she was feeling like she wasn't going anywhere with me.


After about a month I finally was ready to show more of my feelings for her, but when I did she told me she thought a lot about her life and realize she throws herself in relationships and that she therefore needs to be okay with herself first before she can be in a relationship. I completely supported her in this and told her we could just continue being friends or I could even give her more space for herself if she needed that. This was not what she wanted, she wanted us to be more then friends, but not to be in a relationship yet (she needed time to be ready for a relationship). Somewhat confused what that meant I went along with it.


Some time later she starts talking about how she was around her friend and her friends boyfriend, how they were kissing and being affectionate, and she came to the conclusion thats not what she wants at all and was wondering if something was wrong with her. I assured her it was nothing wrong, people need to find their own way in life, but personally I took this as she not being interested in a relationship with me either. 


Then one day she starts talking about how she will never find someone, nobody she likes is ever attracted to her, she is only attracted to people that are bad to her and that she doesn't understand why nice guys does not want to be with her or are interested in her. A bit insulted since I try to be a nice guy, always have been towards her and I am interested in her, I again assure her that she just hasn't met the right person and that she will. I also tell her I am interested in her and in a joking way say I am not such a bad guy am I? To which she responded, that she was not talking about me.


After the last conversation I decided it was best to not get more emotionally involved with her and to tell her I just want to be friends, I wait a few days until she is feeling better and tell her. Thats when she lets me know she is hurt, she really wanted to be with me, she just needs time and thought I would give it to her, that she was just talking what was on her mind and that I should not take it personally, and so on. So I decided maybe I was a bit quick and just needed more patience so I apologize and we agree to go on being more then friends, but after this she was more distant towards me, not by much but enough for me to notice.


She also become more self centered and we started mostly talking about her, she stopped showing any interest in my life or what I had to say. I was also the only one to show any affection at this point and we had a discussion about this, how I felt this was getting very one-sided and although she agreed and said she would make more of an effort, she never did.


Now comes what happened most recently, she started again talking about how nobody she likes, likes her back and gave me an example how she met this guy a couple of days ago, she was very attracted to him and wanted him to just ask her out on a date, but he never did and she felt rejected since she was flirting very hard with him. At this point I had enough, I felt like if she really wants to go out with other people she clearly has no interest in me so I told her I felt really used and had no interest in being anything but friends with her anymore. This is when she started crying, telling me how she lost me, that she needs me, that she messed up and a lot of things like this, so much so that I started feeling I messed up, and told her I was wrong, I still wanted to be with her and that nothing had changed. 


She calmed down and was happy again, but after this she has barely spoken to me and when she does it is just short answers. This is where I am now, I am very confused, she apparently doesn't want us to just be friends (I always made it clear we would still be friends, that wasn't going to change), but her actions says otherwise. I know she is very honest and truthful with me and she tells me everything. She is also a genuine nice person and wouldn't intentionally string me along or use me, so I am very unsure what is going on here now, it could be from her anxiety or depression or it could be something else. I just need advice, is there something I am missing here? What should I do?

134,38dr54,"OK.  Long one.  Hoping there's a Redditor out there who can relate to this.  I don't know what to do.

We have been living together for 6 years, we were planning to get engaged soon, she does a lot of traveling around the area for sales meetings, one of her prospective clients during an AM meeting for breakfast tries to touch her inappropriately and kiss her, she shoves him off and leaves. But what she says was more disturbing was the verbal head games he tried to play, she was utterly repulsed by them.  This is the full extent of what she told me, and she can't bring herself to tell me the full story because it makes her feel very uncomfortable. 

[EDIT:] A few things I left out that are important: 

1)We went to counseling last night, it was a positive experience even thought the therapist seemed wrong, we both agreed.  But we were able to communicate much better on the ride home.

2)We have been friends for almost 20 years, including the last 6.5 as SO's, and she wants to remain friends..she understands my strengths as well as my shortcomings better than anyone and that is something that is invaluable to me, especially when I am striving so hard to improve myself, her validation in this matter is paramount to anyone else's.

3) The sexual assault, she says, was not as disturbing as what he was saying, not that detracts from the whole.  But bear in mind that my reaction was to try to minimalize his action by making fun of him, or basically disregarding someone who obviously shouldn't have had any influence.  Still totally wrong. I am not trying to exonerate myself by adding this, but am trying to give you a better picture.

Noteworthy: She had been accosted once before that I know about, and she just punched the guy in the balls and left.  No problem, it was a clear exchange.  I thought this was the same type of thing.

Later at night when she gets home, truth be told, I had smoked pot and wasn't in the right state of mind for what she was about to tell me, She comes home and tries to tell me what happens and I try to make light of the situation by putting on an accent and pretending to grab her..the stupidest thing I have ever done.  I only did this because I thought it would make her feel like, oh, what happened to me was no big deal.  She reels back, and is now completely distrusting of me.

I know that she has taken this to mean I wasn't there to help her, protect her, and support her..she knows that I am.  I have supported her for years and this is the end of the first year of her new career in this field.  My attitude before which was less than stellar, I am guilty of pushing her too hard to say the least to get a job when she was depressed about it.  Not to mention all the other little jabs thrown, as I am now remembering them all and they are causing me to break down spontaneously.

So, now, I think she has associated all the bad things that happened in our relationship, this event, and me touching her inappropriately, all together.  The primary method of emotional connection with her is now completely closed off and I am losing her because of it.  Not only because of it, but of course due to my past behavior. 

I am seeking help for myself, I am dedicated to fixing myself so that I can be the man I know that I can be, and that she needs and deserves.  I was about to ask her to spend the rest of her life with me, and now I have a crippling fear that it's too late.

I have tried touching her hand, tried holding my hand out for her to take hold of - she will reluctantly take it; the only unsolicited contact I have had was her offering her cheek to kiss it.  Which made me both extremely happy and quickly thereafter, extremely sad.

I have embarked on a serious journey of self-improvement and realization, sparked by this event.  I know in the long run that I will be better off for it, but as I uncover the shit that has been covering up my emotions, I feel like if I can't make it right, I will cave under the utter regret and sadness that will follow - and all my work will be for naught. 

I am so scared, but at the same time, confident.  So sad, but at the same time very eager to please her.  I am hiding the bad things that I am remembering from her because I don't want her to relive them, but I do want her to know that I am punishing myself for them.  I can't keep reminding her of that either, so I fight this battle alone, without the tools I may need.
